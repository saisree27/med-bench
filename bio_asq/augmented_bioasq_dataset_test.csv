Is the protein Papilin secreted?,yes,"Using expression analysis, we identify three genes that are transcriptionally regulated by HLH-2: the protocadherin cdh-3, and two genes encoding secreted extracellular matrix proteins, mig-6/papilin and him-4/hemicentin.  We found that mig-6 encodes long (MIG-6L) and short (MIG-6S) isoforms of the extracellular matrix protein papilin, each required for distinct aspects of DTC migration. Both MIG-6 isoforms have a predicted N-terminal papilin cassette apilins are homologous, secreted extracellular matrix proteins which share a common order of protein domains.  The TSR superfamily is a diverse family of extracellular matrix and transmembrane proteins, many of which have functions related to regulating matrix organization, cell-cell interactions and cell guidance. This review samples some of the contemporary literature regarding TSR superfamily members (e.g. F-spondin, UNC-5, ADAMTS, papilin, and TRAP) where specific functions are assigned to the TSR domains. Papilins are extracellular matrix proteins  Papilin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein   Collagen IV, laminin, glutactin, papilin, and other extracellular matrix proteins were made primarily by hemocytes and were secreted into the medium.  A sulfated glycoprotein was isolated from the culture media of Drosophila Kc cells and named papilin."

Is RANKL secreted from the cells?,yes,"Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble secreted factor that acts as a decoy receptor for receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)  Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted glycoprotein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. It usually functions in bone remodeling, by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis through interaction with a receptor activator of the nuclear factor κB (RANKL). e RANKL/OPG ratio secreted by osteoblasts increased and RANK expression by osteoclasts increased, leading to increased osteoclastogenesis Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is an essential secreted protein in bone turnover due to its role as a decoy receptor for the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kB ligand (RANKL) in the osteoclasts, thus inhibiting their differentiation We identify a TNFSF11 transcript variant that extends the originally identified transcript encoding secreted RANKL.

Has Denosumab (Prolia) been approved by FDA?,yes,"Denosumab is a RANK-ligand antibody that was approved by the FDA in 2010 for the prevention of skeletal fractures in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.  The authors present the imaging findings and technical report of an attempted percutaneous vertebroplasty in the only patient found to be actively under treatment with denosumab after a retrospective review of the databank of patients with pathological fractures referred to the Department Radiology of the Ohio State University for percutaneous vertebroplasty (a total sample of 20 patients) since the FDA approval of denosumab (November 2010) until June of 2013 (a 30-month period). On the basis of this data, the FDA approved denosumab for the treatment of patients whose GCTB is unresectable, or when surgery is likely to result in severe morbidity. Denosumab (Prolia®) is a fully human monoclonal antibody for RANKL, which selectively inhibits osteoclastogenesis, being recently approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at a high or increased risk of fracture by the FDA in the United Sates and by the European Medicines Agency in Europe since June 2010. Recent phase II clinical trials with denosumab in skeletally mature adolescents over age 12 years and adults with GCTB, have shown both safety and efficacy, leading to its accelerated US FDA approval on 13 June 2013.  Zoledronic acid (ZA), an intravenously administered bisphosphonate, and Denosumab, a subcutaneously administered inhibitor of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL), have already been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their use in treatment of bone metastases. These results led to the approval of denosumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the prevention of SREs in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors, including breast cancer. Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, denosumab, and teriparatide are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic options.  Several of these therapies have recently been approved by the FDA to treat bone cancer pain (bisphosphonates, denosumab) and others are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials (tanezumab). A fourth agent, denosumab (bone targeted therapy) was also recently approved by the FDA for patients with bone metastasis after showing a reduction in the occurrence of skeletal-related events.  AHRQ published an updated review in March 2012 that summarized the benefits and risks of osteoporosis medications in treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, including bisphosphonates (aledronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid), parathyroid hormone, teriparatide, calcitonin, estrogens (for prevention in postmenopausal women), selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene), and denosumab(approved by the FDA in 2010).  Four new drugs have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approval in 2010 and 2011: sipuleucel-T, an immunotherapeutic agent; cabazitaxel, a novel microtubule inhibitor; abiraterone acetate, a new androgen biosynthesis inhibitor; and denosumab, a bone-targeting agent.  Recently, the US FDA and the EMA approved denosumab (a fully human monoclonal antibody) to treat skeletal-related events in bone-metastatic prostate cancer. In addition to these new and emerging therapeutic agents, denosumab was approved for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases due to solid tumor malignancies, providing an alternative to zoledronic acid.  Recently, denosumab was FDA-approved for prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.  In the 2010s to date, an additional 3 antibodies (denosumab, belimumab, ipilimumab) have been approved and one antibody-drug conjugate (brentuximab vedotin) is undergoing regulatory review and may be approved in the US by August 30, 2011. We also review the evidence supporting the FDA's approval of denosumab (bone-targeted therapy) as a treatment option for men with CRPC and bony metastases.   It has been approved for clinical use by the FDA in the US and by the European Medicines Agency in Europe since June 2010 (trade name Prolia(™), Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA).  The fully human monoclonal antibody denosumab (Prolia(®)) has been recently approved by the European Medical Agency (EMEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.  Raloxifene and denosumab are only FDA approved for postmenopausal osteoporosis. The new antiresorptive drug, denosumab, although FDA-approved only for postmenopausal women, has been shown in a study of men on ADT to increase bone density in spine, hip, and forearm and decrease vertebral fractures on x-ray.   Since then, an additional six human mAbs have received FDA approval: panitumumab, golimumab, canakinumab, ustekinumab, ofatumumab and denosumab."

Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in women with endometriosis?,yes,"CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid pain syndromes, mood conditions and asthma are common in adolescents and young women with endometriosis. There are many etiologies of pelvic pain that present with symptoms resembling those of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain that are not diagnosable with laparoscopy, such as interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Often, such patients are labelled with irritable bowel syndrome.  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis.  RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with minimal to mild and moderate to severe endometriosis had a higher prevalence of symptoms consistent with IBS (0% vs 65% and 50%, respectively, p<0.001) with significantly lower mean pain thresholds (39.5 mm Hg (95% CI 36.0 to 43.0) vs 28.1 mm Hg (95% CI 24.5 to 31.6), p=0.001 and 28.8 mm Hg (95% CI 24.9 to 32.6), p=0.002) not explained by differences in rectal compliance.  Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1.9, 95% CI (1.03-3.87)]. A weak association between reported family history of endometriosis and history of irritable bowel syndrome and the development of endometriosis was also observed.  Irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation in patients with endometriosis. Fifteen per cent of the patients with endometriosis also had IBS and 14% of the patients with endometriosis had functional constipation without IBS. CONCLUSION: In patients with endometriosis, 29% also had IBS or constipation.  Seventy-six women (21.4%) had previously been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and 79% of them had endometriosis confirmed. Compared with controls, women with endometriosis had increased risks of abdominopelvic pain (OR 5.2 [95% CI: 4.7-5.7]), dysmenorrhoea (OR 8.1 [95% CI: 7.2-9.3]), menorrhagia (OR 4.0 [95% CI: 3.5-4.5]), subfertility (OR 8.2 [95% CI: 6.9-9.9]), dyspareunia and/or postcoital bleeding (OR 6.8 [95% CI: 5.7-8.2]), and ovarian cysts (OR 7.3 [95% CI: 5.7-9.4]), and of being diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (OR 1.6 [95% CI: 1.3-1.8]) or pelvic inflammatory disease (OR 3.0 [95% CI: 2.5-3.6]). Endometriosis may coexist with or be misdiagnosed as pelvic inflammatory disease or IBS. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, women with endometriosis were 3.5 times more likely to have received a diagnosis of IBS (OR 3.5 [95% CI: 3.1-3.9]). Even after women had been diagnosed with endometriosis, they were still two and a half times more likely to receive a new diagnosis of IBS when compared with the controls (OR 2.5 [95% CI: 2.2-2.8]). CONCLUSIONS: Women with endometriosis are more likely to be diagnosed with IBS and PID than controls, even after a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis has been reached. In women, clinical studies suggest that functional pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia, are co-morbid with endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, and others diseases. In women, clinical studies suggest that pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis, which are associated with visceral hyperalgesia, are often comorbid with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain.  Depression, anxiety, IBS, FM, CFS, and IC were more common in migraine with EM group than in controls. Intestinal endometriosis can mimic many gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, infections and neoplasms. Endometriosis is often associated with other painful conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis and fibromyalgia.  CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered in women with recurrent monthly abdominal pain and bowel symptoms, especially if accompanied by gynaecologic complaints, even because the significant symptoms overlap with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and makes the differentiation extremely difficult. Intestinal endometriosis is typically asymptomatic; however, when symptoms occur, they can mimic those of irritable bowel syndrome.  Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis."
Doesn't BNP increase after intensive exercise in athletes?,no,"NT-pro-BNP was significantly elevated postexercise in both adults and adolescents and remained above baseline at 24 h in both groups. NT-pro-BNP concentrations increased significantly (28 +/- 17.1 vs 795 +/- 823 ng x L, P < 0.05), whereas postrace cTnT were elevated in just five athletes (20%). [NT-pro-BNP] was observed immediately after the marathon (median [NT-pro-BNP] before: 39.6 pg ml(-1), after: 138.6 pg ml(-1), p=0.003) with a further increase on day one. [BNP] did not increase immediately after the marathon but increased on day one (median [BNP] before: 15 pg ml(-1), day one: 27.35 pg ml(-1), p=0.006). Pro-BNP was significantly increased immediately post-race (27+/-21 vs 7+/-2 pmol/L pre-race, P < or = 0.007), which 12-24 h later, decreased to 19+/-14 pmol/L (P = 0.07 vs pre-race). The relatively high NT-proBNP levels after active recovery when psychophysical stress is higher, because of cycling and cold water immersion, suggest that not only endurance exercise, but also strenuous, stressful short exercise can induce an increase in NT-proBNP concentrations. Running a marathon significantly increases NT-pro-BNP levels in healthy adults. This increase could be partially attributed to cardiac stress. Increases in NT-proBNP can be found in a major part of obviously healthy athletes after prolonged strenuous exercise. The release of BNP during and after exercise may not result from myocardial damage but may have cytoprotective and growth-regulating effects. The different nature of exercise-induced increases in BNP and cardiac troponins has to be elucidated in the future. In healthy cyclists, transient increases in NT-pro-BNP and cTnT are more likely to reflect cardiac fatigue than injury. The rise in BNP in older athletes may reflect a reversible, mainly diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.  Plasma BNP concentrations were higher in both the judo and marathon groups than in controls, and positively correlated with LV mass as well as with deceleration time. Such exercise significantly increased ANP and BNP levels in healthy men, and the increases could be partially attributed to myocardial damage during the race."
Are there web based self management strategies for chronic pain ?,yes,"Fibromyalgia Symptom Reduction by Online Behavioral Self-monitoring,  This study aimed to evaluate effects of a web-based, self-monitoring and symptom management system (SMARTLog) that analyzes personal self-monitoring data and delivers data-based feedback over time. Moderate use (3 times weekly x 3 months) increased likelihood of clinically significant improvements in pain, memory, gastrointestinal problems, depression, fatigue, and concentration; heavy use (4.5 times weekly x five months) produced the above plus improvement in stiffness and sleep difficulties. Results suggest that the tailored online chronic pain management program showed promising effects on pain at 1 and 6 months posttreatment and quality of life at 6 months posttreatment in this naturalistic study. Results suggest the potential value of self-management for chronic pain patients and the potential acceptability of web-based delivery of intervention content. Patient involvement can be fostered by web-based applications combining health information with decision support or behaviour change support. These so-called Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) can reach great numbers of patients at low financial cost and provide information and support at the time, place and learning speed patients prefer. Web-based interventions may also be effective in enhancing self-management for individuals with chronic pain, but little is known about long-term effects. Research on Web-based interventions to support self-management following participation in pain management programs is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to examine the long-term effects of a 4-week smartphone-intervention"
Isn't Weaver syndrome similar to Sotos?,no,"Overgrowth conditions are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by increased growth and variable features, including macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and various degrees of learning difficulties and intellectual disability. Among them, Sotos and Weaver syndromes are clinically well defined and due to heterozygous mutations in NSD1 and EZH2, respectively. NSD1 and EZH2 are both histone-modifying enzymes NSD1 and EZH2 are SET domain-containing histone methyltransferases that play key roles in the regulation of transcription through histone modification and chromatin modeling: NSD1 preferentially methylates lysine residue 36 of histone 3 (H3K36) and is primarily associated with active transcription, while EZH2 shows specificity for lysine residue 27 (H3K27) and is associated with transcriptional repression Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap Clinically, Weaver syndrome is closely related to Sotos syndrome, which is frequently caused by mutations in NSD1 Overgrowth syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Weaver syndrome have an increased risk of neoplasia. Thus, it is not surprising that prenatal overgrowth occurs in several syndromes, including the Sotos and Weaver syndromes. NSD1 mutations are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and occur in some cases of Weaver syndrome but are rare in other overgrowth phenotypes. We conclude therefore that NSD1 mutations account for most cases of Sotos syndrome and a significant number of Weaver syndrome cases in our series. We conclude that intragenic mutations of NSD1 are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and account for some Weaver syndrome cases but rarely occur in other childhood overgrowth phenotypes. Overgrowth syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Weaver syndrome have an increased risk of neoplasia NSD1 mutations are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and occur in some cases of Weaver syndrome but are rare in other overgrowth phenotypes We conclude that intragenic mutations of NSD1 are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and account for some Weaver syndrome cases but rarely occur in other childhood overgrowth phenotypes Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident.  Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident. The identification of an EZH2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and Sotos syndromes.  Overgrowth syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Weaver syndrome have an increased risk of neoplasia. Two previous cases of neuroblastoma have been reported in children with Weaver syndrome. Weaver syndrome is closely related to Sotos syndrome, Overgrowth syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Weaver syndrome have an increased risk of neoplasia. Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident. Clinically, Weaver syndrome is closely related to Sotos syndrome, which is frequently caused by mutations in NSD1."
Are long non coding RNAs as conserved in sequence as protein coding genes?,no,"Most lncRNAs are under lower sequence constraints than protein-coding genes and lack conserved secondary structures, making it hard to predict them computationally. hey are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. bout one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage."

Is CD56 useful in Ewing sarcoma prognosis?,yes,"Excellent prognosis in a subset of patients with Ewing sarcoma identified at diagnosis by CD56 using flow cytometry There was a highly significant correlation between CD56 expression and progression-free survival (PFS; 69% in low/negative expression versus 30% in high expression groups, P = 0.024) In patients with localized nonpelvic disease, those expressing low/negative CD56 had 100% PFS versus 40% in the high expressing group (P = 0.02) CD56 was found to be an independent prognostic marker with an 11-fold increased risk for relapse in patients with localized disease (P = 0.006) CD56 expression could be used to reveal ES patients with excellent prognosis or patients predisposed to relapse, thus improving treatment stratification and implementation of personalized therapy Excellent prognosis in a subset of patients with Ewing sarcoma identified at diagnosis by CD56 using flow cytometry. Three years after diagnosis the patient presented with severe respiratory difficulty and following resection, the final pathology revealed multiple tumors with foci of high grade sarcoma compatible with primitive neuroectodermal tumor/extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma based on morphology and immunohistochemistry (CD99, CD56). CD56 expression could be used to reveal ES patients with excellent prognosis or patients predisposed to relapse, thus improving treatment stratification and implementation of personalized therapy.

Aren't there any urine biomarkers for chronic kidney disease?,no,"Kidney and urine proteomic biomarkers are considered as promising diagnostic tools to predict CKD progression early in diabetic nephropathy, facilitating timely and selective intervention that may reduce the related health-care expenditures. Both blood and urine biomarkers are reviewed in this paper and offer a considerable opportunity to enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology and known epidemiology of these recently defined syndromes. Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have been subclassified as five defined entities which represent clinical circumstances in which both the heart and the kidney are involved in a bidirectional injury and dysfunction via a final common pathway of cell-to-cell death and accelerated apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress. There is a strong association between both acute and chronic dysfunction of the heart and kidneys with respect to morbidity and mortality. Both blood and urine biomarkers, including the assessment of catalytic iron, a critical element to the generation of oxygen-free radicals and oxidative stress, are reviewed in this paper. Identification of urine biomarkers has proven to be beneficial in recent years because of ease of handling, stability, and the ability to standardize the various markers to creatinine or other peptides generally already present in the urine. Recent markers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and podocin have garnered a lot of attention. The emergence of these and other biomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic applications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease."
Isn't valproic acid effective for glioblastoma treatment?,no,"A Phase 2 Study of Concurrent Radiation Therapy, Temozolomide, and the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Valproic Acid for Patients With Glioblastoma. PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models.  Median overall survival (OS) was 29.6 months (range: 21-63.8 months), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5 months (range: 6.8-51.2 months). OS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 97%, 86%, and 56%, respectively. PFS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 70%, 43%, and 38% respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT/TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM was well tolerated. Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. Treatment of GDSCs with histone deacetylase inhibitors, TSA and VPA, significantly reduced proliferation rates of the cells and expression of the stem cell markers, indicating differentiation of the cells. Since differentiation into GBM makes them susceptible to the conventional cancer treatments, we posit that use of histone deacetylase inhibitors may increase efficacy of the conventional cancer treatments for eliminating GDSCs. Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients.  Our meta-analysis confirmed the benefit of using VPA (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.71). Sub-group analysis shows that patients treated with VPA had a hazard ratio of 0.74 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.59-0.94 vs. patients treated by other-AEDs and a hazard ratio of 0.66 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.52-0.84 vs. patients treated by administration of non-AEDs.  .CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to VPA administration.  A new and exciting insight is the potential contribution of VPA to prolonged survival, particularly in glioblastomas.  Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT) Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival. Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma. PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for GB was associated with overall survival (OS).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 544 adults with GB were retrospectively reviewed. Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS.RESULTS: Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA.  When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=.057; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history. Patients using VPA in combination with temozolomide showed a longer median survival of 69 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61.7-67.3) compared with 61 weeks (95% CI: 52.5-69.5) in the group without VPA (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; P = .016), adjusting for age, extent of resection, and O(6)-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase promoter methylation status. Use of VPA together with chemoradiation with temozolomide results in a 2-months' longer survival of patients with GBM."
Can Levoxyl (levothyroxine sodium) cause insomnia?,yes,"METHODS: Seventy-one patients diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism were randomly allocated into two study groups: the first group received usual dose of levothyroxine and the second group received combination of levothyroxine and liothyronine for at least 4 months. The main outcomes were psychosocial problems (Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire, GHQ-28), bodyweight, heart rate, blood pressure, and serum lipid levels. RESULTS: In both groups serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels remained unchanged compared with baseline. Psychosocial scores, body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and lipid profile in the two groups remained constant. The only exception was a small but significant reduction in anxiety/insomnia in combined treatment group as compared with monotherapy."
Doesn't the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?,no,"To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci. By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci Here we show that zebrafish runx1 is directly bound by cohesin and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) at the P1 and P2 promoters, and within the intron between P1 and P2. The intronic binding sites for cohesin and CTCF coincide with histone modifications that confer enhancer-like properties, and two of the cohesin/CTCF sites behaved as insulators in an in vivo assay The identified cohesin and CTCF binding sites are likely to be cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for runx1 since they also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We have found that CTCF and cohesin are highly enriched at the convergent and partially overlapping transcripts for the LMP1 and LMP2A genes, but it is not yet known how CTCF and cohesin may coordinately regulate these transcripts haracterization of constitutive CTCF/cohesin loci: a possible role in establishing topological domains in mammalian genomes Our analysis revealed: 1) constitutive CTCF loci were located in constitutive open chromatin and often co-localized with constitutive cohesin loci In brain, a third of CTCF and cohesin binding sites coincide, consistent with the potential for many interactions between cohesin and CTCF but also many instances of independent action Here, we focus on the emerging roles of CTCF and the cohesin in coordinating long-range interactions between regulatory elements Chromatin immunoprecipitation for CTCF and the cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC3 reveals evolutionarily conserved binding sites within unmethylated regions ∼5 kb downstream of the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region and within the PLAGL1 3' untranslated region (UTR) TCF physically links cohesin to chromatin ohesin and CTCF: cooperating to control chromosome conformation? Recently, three groups mapped numerous cohesin-binding sites in mammalian chromosomes and found substantial overlap with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) We found that each site contains a conserved CTCF consensus sequence, binds CTCF, and recruits the cohesin subunit Rad21 in vivo Recent experiments have revealed that cohesin binds to the same sites in mammalian genomes as the zinc finger transcription factor CTCF Here we review what is known about the roles of cohesin and CTCF in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells, and we discuss how cohesin might mediate the insulator function of CTCF Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival We used chromosome conformation capture to determine long-range interactions among CTCF/cohesin sites over 2 Mb on human chromosome 11 encompassing the beta-globin locus and flanking olfactory receptor genes These results support a genome-wide role for CTCF/cohesin sites through loop formation that both influences transcription and contributes to cell-type-specific chromatin organization and function Increased methylation at this promoter triggered the dissociation of the insulator protein CTCF as well as the accompanying cohesin from the BDNF locus icotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-regulated DNA methylation alters CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding and transcription at the BDNF locus ecent studies have shown that the protein CTCF, which plays an important role in insulation and in large-scale organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus, depends for both activities on recruitment of the cohesin complex We show here that the interaction of CTCF with the cohesin complex involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit SA2 and specific regions of the C-terminal tail of CTCF Taken together, our results demonstrate that specific sites on the C terminus of CTCF are essential for cohesin binding and insulator function The only direct interaction between CTCF and cohesin involves contact with SA2, which is external to the cohesin ring These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement We have previously shown that the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) major latency transcripts encoding LANA, vCyclin, vFLIP, v-miRNAs, and Kaposin are regulated, in part, by a chromatin organizing element that binds CTCF and cohesins Mutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages, and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number control Our findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions, and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control. We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript. GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites. GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron. These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability. TCF and cohesin cooperatively mediate the cell-type specific interchromatin interaction between Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF and cohesin. enome-wide studies of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin provide insight into chromatin structure and regulation Recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with cohesin Here, we show by ChIP-Seq that most human subtelomeres contain a CTCF- and cohesin-binding site within ∼1-2 kb of the TTAGGG repeat tract and adjacent to a CpG-islands implicated in TERRA transcription control. These findings indicate that CTCF and cohesin are integral components of most human subtelomeres, and important for the regulation of TERRA transcription and telomere end protection In addition, we show that this DNA looping requires specific binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex to two symmetrically aligned binding sites in both the transcriptionally active promoters and in one of the enhancers"
Are stress granules involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,yes,"SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity. A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.  Two RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, aggregate in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause some forms of ALS. Recent work connecting TDP-43 and FUS to stress granules has suggested how this cellular pathway, which involves protein aggregation as part of its normal function, might be coopted during disease pathogenesis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. Fused in sarcoma (FUS) belongs to the group of RNA-binding proteins implicated as underlying factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and certain other neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple FUS gene mutations have been linked to hereditary forms, and aggregation of FUS protein is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of these diseases. In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). Profilin 1 associates with stress granules and ALS-linked mutations alter stress granule dynamics Here we report that profilin 1 and related protein profilin 2 are novel stress granule-associated proteins in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human cell lines and that ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis Furthermore, in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels. Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules. Our results suggest that the ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism. RNA-binding ability of FUS regulates neurodegeneration, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules associated with FUS carrying ALS-linked mutations. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granules In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons and glia, where it associates with stress granules (SGs) and forms large inclusions Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules Mutations in Fus cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the mutant protein forms inclusions that appear to correspond to stress granules Recent work also suggests that TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic stress granules, which are transient structures that form in response to stress.  We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested.  Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked FUS/TLS alters stress granule assembly and dynamics. Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies.  . Autophagy regulates amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked fused in sarcoma-positive stress granules in neurons However, the role of autophagy in regulation of FUS-positive stress granules (SGs) and aggregates remains unclear.  Although co-localized primarily in the nucleus in normal condition, FUS/TLS and PRMT1 were partially recruited to the cytoplasmic granules under oxidative stress, which were merged with stress granules (SGs) markers in SH-SY5Y cell. The effect of PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation on the subcellular localization, stress granules, and detergent-insoluble aggregates of FUS/TLS Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration. Here, we exploited a Drosophila model of ALS and neuronal cell lines to elucidate the role of the RNA-binding ability of FUS in regulating FUS-mediated toxicity, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules (SGs).  Stress granules as crucibles of ALS pathogenesis"
Does TGF-beta play a role in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction?,yes,"We then performed a chemical screen and identified several small molecules that increase or reduce cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart development. These compounds act via Hedgehog, Insulin-like growth factor or Transforming growth factor β signaling pathways.  Here, we report that the balance between the reparative and regenerative processes is achieved through Smad3-dependent TGFβ signaling.  Thus, TGFβ signaling orchestrates the beneficial interplay between scar-based repair and cardiomyocyte-based regeneration to achieve complete heart regeneration. As expected, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a profibrotic cytokine, was dramatically upregulated in MI hearts, but its phosphorylated comediator (pSmad) was significantly downregulated in the nuclei of Cx43-deficient hearts post-MI, suggesting that downstream signaling of TGF-beta is diminished substantially in Cx43-deficient hearts. This diminution in profibrotic TGF-beta signaling resulted in the attenuation of adverse structural remodeling as assessed by echocardiography. Potentially beneficial changes include increases in the HSMP secretory-leucocyte-protease-inhibitor (SLPI) and cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1). Targeting these proteins may mitigate enhanced LV remodeling and dysfunction with aging. After injury, the presence of macrophages, which secreted high levels of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, led to rapid removal of cell debris and replacement by granulation tissue containing inflammatory cells and blood vessels, followed by myofibroblast infiltration and collagen deposition. Secretion of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A as well as neovascularization, myofibroblast infiltration, and collagen deposition decreased.  Repression of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine synthesis, mediated in part through Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-beta and Interleukin (IL)-10, is critical for resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate and transition to fibrous tissue deposition. TGF-beta conducted the myogenic differentiation of CD117+ stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2.5 expression. Therefore, the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed CD117+ cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration and induced therapeutic angiogenesis, contributing to functional cardiac regeneration. These results indicate that TGF-beta/Smad signaling may be involved in the remodeling of the infarct scar after the completion of wound healing per se, via ongoing stimulation of matrix deposition."

Isn't GAGA associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFR)?,no,"One of the three nuclease hypersensitive sites in the Fab-7 boundary, HS1, contains multiple consensus-binding sequences for the GAGA factor, a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin. The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1. The interactions of GAGA factor and heat shock factor with their binding sites in chromatin occurred in two modes. Their interaction with binding sites in the nucleosome-free regions did not require ATP. In the presence of ATP both factors interacted also with nucleosomal binding sites, causing nucleosome rearrangements and a refinement of nucleosome positions While chromatin remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization.  These (CT)n repeats are associated with a nonhistone protein(s) in vivo and are bound by a purified Drosophila protein, the GAGA factor, in vitro. This (CT)n element appears to contribute to formation of the wild-type chromatin structure of hsp26, an organized nucleosome array that leaves the HSEs in nucleosome-free, DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) site The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1. One of the three nuclease hypersensitive sites in the Fab-7 boundary, HS1, contains multiple consensus-binding sequences for the GAGA factor, a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin. The iab-7 polycomb response element maps to a nucleosome-free region of chromatin and requires both GAGA and pleiohomeotic for silencing activity. The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1."
Isn't amiodarone a class I anti-arrhythmic drug?,yes,"Common class I agents are excluded due to the inherent abnormal cardiac structure and function in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Class III drug options include dofetilide and amiodarone. Amiodarone has been used as an anti-arrhythmic drug since the 1970s and has an established role in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although considered to be a class III anti-arrhythmic, amiodarone also has class I, II and IV actions, which gives it a unique pharmacological and anti-arrhythmic profile.  Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative, introduced in 1960's as an anti-anginal agent, emerged as a potent anti-arrhythmic agent by 1970's and is currently one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in US for ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent. Amiodarone, a representative class III agent, exerts negative dromotropism by suppressing the fast sodium current responsible for conduction in acute administration (class I effects). Chronic amiodarone causes prolongation of ERP (class III effects), which is sometimes associated with negative dromotropism based on the alteration of passive or active membrane properties. Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with predominantly class III anti-arrhythmic effects, is used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is one of the most effective drugs used in the treatment of ventricular and paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent Although considered to be a class III anti-arrhythmic, amiodarone also has class I, II and IV actions, which gives it a unique pharmacological and anti-arrhythmic profile Amiodarone is a potent class III anti-arrhythmic drug that also possesses beta-blocking properties"
Is PTEN involved in follicular thyroid carcinoma?,yes,"Two of the 259 patients (0.8%), with both follicular thyroid carcinoma and macrocephaly, were found to carry a germline mutation in the PTEN gene. The PTEN mutation frequency in unselected cases of follicular thyroid carcinoma was 4.8% The frequency of germline pathogenic PTEN mutations in an unselected series of patients with DTC is relatively low, but it is enriched by considering follicular histology and macrocephaly Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) A single male with follicular thyroid carcinoma from one of these 64 (2%) CS-like families harboured a germline point mutation, c.209T-->C Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors. These results show a high frequency of PTEN promoter hypermethylation, especially in follicular tumors, suggesting its possible role in thyroid tumorigenesis Our findings suggest that the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is occasionally inactivated in sporadic follicular thyroid tumors Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase, have been found in up to 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome suggesting a role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors The most common neoplasms in Cowden disease patients arise in the breast, skin, and thyroid (follicular subtype) The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors"
Does strenuous physical activity affect thyroid hormone metabolism?,yes,"The results of the present study in a unique experimental human model of maximal exposure to altitude and physical exercise demonstrate that extreme HA and strenuous physical exercise are coupled with specific endocrine adaptations. These include increased activity of the GH/IGF-I axis and a low T(3) syndrome 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 levels increase during strenuous exercise, and, at the end of the exercise bout, a decrease of T3 and T4 levels, with an increase in TSH during the following 4-5 days, is seen. the obtained results indicate that in intense exercise, causing the rapid development of fatigue, rapid increases in serum levels of hormones of the pituitary-adrenocortical, pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-thyroid systems occur. Mean levels of fasting plasma estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were significantly lower in AR compared to ER and SE. Reductions in plasma T4, T3 and T3/T4 ratio are probably due to inhibition of T4 secretion and 5'-monodeiodination with possible conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3). These processes may represent a mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous and extended flight. Strenuous endurance training seems to have minor changes on the function of the thyroid gland. Depressed T4 levels in runners may rather be due to lowered TBG levels than due to direct effect of training. brief strenuous swimming or moderate bicycle exercise had minor or no effect on thyroid hormone concentrations when consideration was given to the attendant hemoconcentration. thyroxine were determined in 26 men participating in a 90-km cross-country ski race, before, immediately after, and on the following days Total thyroxine and free thyroxine in serum were significantly increased at the end of the race, but had returned to the pre-raced levels during the rest of the observation period. There are controversial results concerning thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous exercise in adult athletes and only scant data concerning the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in children and adolescents."
Isn't the gene MAOA epigenetically modified by methylation?,no,"Evidence that the methylation state of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene predicts brain activity of MAO A enzyme in healthy men. We found significant interindividual differences in methylation status and methylation patterns of the core MAOA promoter.  In the present study, DNA methylation patterns in the MAOA regulatory and exon 1/intron 1 region were investigated for association with panic disorder with particular attention to possible effects of gender and environmental factors.   The present pilot data suggest a potential role of MAOA gene hypomethylation in the pathogenesis of panic disorder particularly in female patients, possibly mediating a detrimental influence of negative life events.  The MAOA promoter was hypermethylated immediately upstream of the start codon in cholangiocarcinoma samples and cell lines but not in nonmalignant counterparts.  MAOA promoter methylation and susceptibility to carotid atherosclerosis: role of familial factors in a monozygotic twin sample. Because twins reared together share early life experience, which may leave a long-lasting epigenetic mark, aberrant MAOA methylation may represent an early biomarker for unhealthy familial environment. Effects of MAOA promoter methylation on susceptibility to paranoid schizophrenia. In conclusion, abnormalities of DNA methylation at the MAOA promoter may be associated with schizophrenia in males. In our study we analyzed DNA methylation patterns of 14 neuropsychiatric genes (COMT, DAT1, GABRA1, GNB3, GRIN2B, HTR1B, HTR2A, 5-HTT, MAOA, MAOB, NOS1, NR3C1, TPH1 and TH). D Our data suggest that aberrant epigenetic regulation of neuropsychiatric genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD. We conclude that smoking reliably decreases MAOA methylation, but exact characterization of effects on level of methylation depend on genotype, smoking history, current smoking status, gender, and region of the promoter-associated CpG Island examined. Given that DNA methylation is linked to the regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms factor into the MAOA expression  the extended MAOA regulatory region contains two CpG islands (CGIs), one of which overlaps with the canonical MAOA promoter and the other is located further upstream; both CGIs exhibit sensitivity to differential methylation. Identification and characterization of putative methylation targets in the MAOA locus using bioinformatic approaches. DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism involved in the developmental regulation of gene expression.  MAOA methylation is associated with nicotine and alcohol dependence in women. In recent years, the role of epigenetic phenomenon, such as methylation, in mediating vulnerability to behavioral illness has become increasingly appreciated. One prominent locus at which epigenetic phenomena are thought to be in play is the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) locus.  We conclude that methylation of MAOA may play a significant role in common psychiatric illness and that further examination of epigenetic processes at this locus is in order. Analysis of CpG methylation in the MAOA promoter region revealed substantial methylation in females but not in males. Therefore, allelic mRNA expression is affected by genetic and epigenetic events, both with the potential to modulate biogenic amine tone in the CNS."
Are there any statistical methods for normalizing and identifying differential regions in histone modification ChIP-seq data?,yes,"ChIPnorm: a statistical method for normalizing and identifying differential regions in histone modification ChIP-seq libraries. In this paper we propose a two-stage statistical method, called ChIPnorm, to normalize ChIP-seq data, and to find differential regions in the genome, given two libraries of histone modifications of different cell types. We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods. We correlate the histone marks with gene expression data and confirm that histone modifications H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 act as respectively a repressor and an activator of genes. Compared to what was previously reported in the literature, we find that a substantially higher fraction of bivalent marks in ES cells for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 move into a K27-only state. We find that most of the promoter regions in protein-coding genes have differential histone-modification sites.

Aren't there any statistical methods for normalizing and identifying differential regions in histone modification ChIP-seq data?,no,"ChIPnorm: a statistical method for normalizing and identifying differential regions in histone modification ChIP-seq libraries. In this paper we propose a two-stage statistical method, called ChIPnorm, to normalize ChIP-seq data, and to find differential regions in the genome, given two libraries of histone modifications of different cell types. We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods. We correlate the histone marks with gene expression data and confirm that histone modifications H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 act as respectively a repressor and an activator of genes. Compared to what was previously reported in the literature, we find that a substantially higher fraction of bivalent marks in ES cells for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 move into a K27-only state. We find that most of the promoter regions in protein-coding genes have differential histone-modification sites.

Does thyroid hormone regulate calcium transient in the myocardium?,yes,"3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) is a novel endogenous relative of thyroid hormone, able to interact with trace amine-associated receptors, a class of plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptors, and to produce a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect In adult rat cardiomyocytes acute exposure to 20 microM T(1)AM decreased the amplitude and duration of the calcium transient. In normal porcine myocardium T3 had no effect on the extent of isometric force generation but accelerated the time course of force development (p < 0.05) and increased the calcium transient (p < 0.001). After induction of myocardial depression by epinephrine exposure T3 accelerated the intracellular calcium transients and reduced diastolic calcium The experimental data showing increased force amplitudes at unaltered amplitudes of the intracellular calcium transient and an even-reduced calcium time integral provide strong evidence for a sensitization of the contractile apparatus for calcium by triiodothyronine hese results indicate that the thyroid state influences the time course of the calcium transient and are consistent with the abbreviation in the duration of contraction that is observed in the hyperthyroid state."

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,yes,"This study reports the consequences of LT4 treatment over a prolonged period of time in 2 of the first patients with a heterozygous mutation in TRα1. Here we show that the dysregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis was worsened by the lack of TR alpha1 in TR betaPV mice, and severe impairment of postnatal growth was manifested in TR betaPV mice deficient in TR alpha1. Heterozygous 2- to 3-week- old mice exhibit a severe retardation of post-natal development and growth, but only a minor reduction in serum thyroxine levels.  The data demonstrate a novel array of effects mediated by a dominant negative TRalpha1, and may provide important clues for identification of a potentially unrecognized human disorder and its treatment. No mutations in DNA- and hormone-binding-domains of TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 genes were found in proband, suggesting that the defect could be due to an unknown mutation in either the TR gene or a post receptor abnormality These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice. Therefore, TR alpha1 could play a compensatory role in mediating the functions of T3 in heterozygous patients with RTH."

Does administration of triiodothyronine improve outcome following coronary artery bypass grafting?,no,"Serum T3 concentrations were significantly higher with fewer patients having T3 concentrations below the normal range in the T3 group than the placebo group throughout the postoperative period. Hemodynamic variables, postoperative inotrope requirement, and outcome variables showed no differences between the groups We conclude that although widespread interest has been shown on the use of thyroid hormones in the perioperative period, and the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid hormone metabolism widely studied, there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Treatment with GIK, T3, and GIK/T3 improves hemodynamic performance and results in reduced cTnI release in patients undergoing on-pump CABG surgery. Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Parenteral triiodothyronine given after crossclamp removal during elective coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improved postoperative ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was slightly decreased, and the need for postoperative pacemaker support was reduced. Perioperative T3 administration decreased the incidence and need for treatment of postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Intravenous T(3) does not have dramatic effects on hemodynamic variables in this setting as has been previously suggested.  Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy. No significant differences were noted in the pre and post CPB hemodynamics between the two groups for the most part of the study except that heart rate was increased in T3 group. The haemodynamic parameters were no different between the two groups at any postoperative time point. Likewise, density and affinity of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors were not significantly different from pre-operative values in either group."
Is long QT syndrome a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes?,yes,"A diversity of cardiovascular disorders including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary anomalies, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, dilated cardiomyopathy, aortic rupture due to Marfan syndrome, myocarditis, valvular disease and electrical disorders (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome), as well as commotio cordis represent the common causes of SCD in young athletes. Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of mortality among young athletes with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 athletes per annum. The majority of cases are caused by an underlying structural cardiac abnormality, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. More recently, the understanding of non-structural causes such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome has grown and diagnostic criteria have been developed.  This review considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of age. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan's syndrome.  Knowledge of sudden cardiac death in young athletes is imperative for all physicians and allied health professionals.  In this article, we review several etiologies of sudden cardiac death, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and commotio cordis.  Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is generally caused by inherited cardiac disorders. The genetic abnormalities most associated with SCD are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The most common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Other reasons are congenital coronary artery anomalies, nivocarditis, dilatative cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle, sarcoidosis, mitral valve prolapse, aortic valve stenosis, atherosclerosis, long QT syndrome, and blunt impact to the chest. The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by cardiac ion channel mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often related to exercise.  A group of relatively uncommon but important genetic cardiovascular diseases (GCVDs) are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death during exercise, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Primary electrical disorders (such as the long QT syndrome) are rarely present in athletes but, so far, are a considerable reason for disqualification from sport activity."

Hasn't depression been shown to be a predictor of frailty?,no,"significant role of frailty as a predictor of depression in a relatively younger old Chinese population significant relationships between frailty and depressive symptoms and mortality at 1 year These findings suggest that malnutrition is a major predictor of frailty or the ""failure to thrive"" syndrome in older persons. Depression is a major cause of poor nutritional status in older persons. Depressed mood was associated with increased risk of steep strength decline, in particular in older men with low body weight. Low body weight in combination with depressed mood may be an indicator of frailty or severe disease status that leads to accelerated strength loss and disability. Longitudinally, depressed mood was the only independent predictor of decline in cognition, functional ability, physician-rated health, and mortality;"
Is there any association between Jarid2 and miR-155 in Th17 cells?,yes,"Jarid2 links MicroRNA and chromatin in Th17 cells. In this issue of Immunity, Escobar et al. (2014) bring microRNAs and chromatin together by showing how activation-induced miR-155 targets the chromatin protein Jarid2 to regulate proinflammatory cytokine production in T helper 17 cells. miR-155 activates cytokine gene expression in Th17 cells by regulating the DNA-binding protein Jarid2 to relieve polycomb-mediated repression. Mir155 was bound by Th17 cell transcription factors and was highly expressed during Th17 cell differentiation. miR-155-deficient Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells expressed increased amounts of Jarid2, a DNA-binding protein that recruits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to chromatin. PRC2 binding to chromatin and H3K27 histone methylation was increased in miR-155-deficient cells, coinciding with failure to express Il22, Il10, Il9, and Atf3. Defects in Th17 cell cytokine expression and Treg cell homeostasis in the absence of Mir155 could be partially suppressed by Jarid2 deletion. Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2. Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2. Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2.

Can DNA intercalators function as topoisomerase inhibitors?,yes,"The aporphine alkaloids (+)-dicentrine and (+)-bulbocapnine are non-planar molecules lacking features normally associated with DNA binding by intercalation or minor groove binding. Surprisingly, dicentrine showed significant activity as a topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) inhibitor and also was active in a DNA unwinding assay. The DNA unwinding suggests DNA intercalation, which could explain the inhibition of topoisomerase II. We found that several agents, including adriamycin (a DNA intercalator and inhibitor of topoisomerase II) Amsacrine, a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor, is efficacious as an antileukemogenic agent. Quinacrine was less effective. (ii) Inhibitors intercalating and binding to the 'cleavable' DNA-topoisomerase complex (m-AMSA, mitoxantrone, doxorubicin and daunorubicin) strongly suppressed reparative DNA incision.  DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. To determine whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs Empirical assays consisting of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II.  Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation. Abnormal expression of the nuclear-associated enzyme DNA topoisomerase II (topoisomerase II) has been implicated in the in vitro phenotype of radiation hypersensitive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and in modifying sensitivity of eukaryotic cells to topoisomerase II-inhibitor drugs [e.g., the DNA intercalator amsacrine (mAMSA)].  All three tested anthraquinones, emodin, aloe-emodin, and danthron, showed capabilities to inhibit the non-covalent binding of bisbenzimide Hoechst 33342 to isolated DNA and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells comparable to the topoisomerase II inhibitor and intercalator m-amsacrine. These studies suggest that AD 288 inhibits topoisomerase II activity by preventing the initial non-covalent binding of topoisomerase II to DNA. Since AD 288 is a potent DNA intercalator, catalytic inhibition is achieved by prohibiting access of the enzyme to DNA binding sites.  AQ4N (1,4-bis[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] amino]-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9, 10-dione bis-N-oxide dihydrochloride) is a prodrug which is selectively activated within hypoxic tissues to AQ4, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA intercalator. Amonafide is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.  We found that three compounds had similar cancer cell-selective growth inhibition to amonafide, while retaining similar subcellular localization, DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition activities. Amonafide is a novel topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitor and DNA intercalator that induces apoptotic signaling by blocking the binding of Topo II to DNA. At higher concentrations, inhibition of Top1 catalytic activity and DNA intercalation is observed. Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new oligopyrrole carboxamides linked with tricyclic DNA-intercalators as potential DNA ligands or topoisomerase inhibitors. It was found that 1) morpholinyldoxorubicin, cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, and Actinomycin D (but not doxorubicin) stimulated DNA topoisomerase I-induced cleavage at specific DNA sites; 2) only doxorubicin and Actinomycin D stimulated DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II; 3) at higher drug concentrations, DNA intercalators suppressed enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage induced by DNA topoisomerase I, as well as topoisomerase II; 4) only cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin produced DNA-DNA cross-links; no DNA unwinding could be observed; and 5) DNA intercalation (unwinding) potency of morpholinyldoxorubicin was about 2-fold less than that of doxorubicin. The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I. The screen of cMAP for uncharacterized drugs indicated the signature of Epoxy anthraquinone derivative (EAD) matched the profiles of multiple known DNA targeted agents (topoisomerase I/II inhibitors, DNA intercalators, and DNA alkylation agents) as predicted by its structure. Cytotoxicity of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators is thought to result from disturbance of DNA metabolism following trapping of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. Numerous topoisomerase I poisons including DNA minor groove binders such as Hoechst 33258 and DNA intercalators such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids and indolocarbazole derivatives have been discovered and developed. The stabilization of cleavage intermediates by intercalators may have a common mechanism for DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II. Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Taken together, our results suggest that much of the activity and specificity of m-AMSA as a topoisomerase II poison is embodied in the headgroup, while DNA intercalation is used primarily to increase the affinity of m-AMSA for the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex. The cross-sensitivity patterns of the mutant were examined for covalently (anthramycin) and non-covalently (distamycin A) binding minor groove ligands, and DNA intercalating [adriamycin, mitoxantrone and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA)] and non-intercalating (VP16-213) topoisomerase II poisons. Quinoline alkaloids as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Structure-activity relationships for a series of amiloride analogs. These include: (i) the production of improved topoisomerase inhibitors (by consideration of drug/protein as well as drug/DNA interactions); (ii) the development of reductively-activated chromophores as hypoxia-selective agents; and (iii) the use of DNA-intercalators of known DNA binding orientation as 'carriers' for the delivery of other reactive functionality specifically (sequence-, regio- and site-specifically) to DNA. Indolo[2,3-b]quinolines are a family of DNA intercalators and inhibitors of topoisomerase II, synthetic analogs of neocryptolepine, an alkaloid traditionally used in African folk medicine. Their ability to function as bis-intercalators was assessed by a novel and convenient topoisomerase fluorescent assay. Structure-activity relationship of polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complexes as DNA intercalators, DNA photocleavage reagents, and DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibitors. In addition, fragments of about 900 kbp were detected in the cells treated with a topoisomerase inhibitor, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methane-sulfon-m-anisidine, and fragments in the broad size range between 700 and 245 kbp in the cells treated with radical producers, bleomycin and neocarzinostatin.  The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I.  Long-term inhibition of DNA synthesis and the persistence of trapped topoisomerase II complexes in determining the toxicity of the antitumor DNA intercalators mAMSA and mitoxantrone. Effects of the DNA intercalators 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium on topoisomerase II mediated DNA strand cleavage and strand passage. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks.  Here, molecular interactions of the potent antitumor drug amsacrine (m-AMSA), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, within living K562 cancer cells have been studied using surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy.  It has been shown previously that DNA intercalators can inhibit the action of amsacrine and several other topoisomerase II poisons, presumably as a result of interference with the DNA binding sites for the enzyme.  The gadd153 promoter was strongly activated by a broad spectrum of genotoxic agents including UV-mimetic agents, DNA-cross-linking and alkylating agents, DNA intercalators, and topoisomerase inhibitors.  Our study indicates that Epoxy anthraquinone derivative may be a novel DNA topoisomerase inhibitor that can be potentially used for treatment of neuroblastoma or other cancer patients. Organic intercalators can inhibit nucleic acid synthesis in vivo, and they are now common anticancer drugs in clinical therapy.  Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells. Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. A function for topoisomerases I and II in DNA excision repair can be postulated from the organization of the mammalian chromosome, involving nucleosomal structures and matrix-attached DNA loops. To analyse this function we determined UV-induced DNA incision in confluent human fibroblasts in the presence of 16 inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II which belonged to at least five different drug categories, based on their mechanism of action. In experiments to determine the mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by amiloride, we observed that amiloride inhibited both the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent cell functions in vivo. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. The pyridoacridines&apos; ability to inhibit TOPO II-mediated decatenation of kDNA correlated with their cytotoxic potencies and their ability to intercalate into calf thymus DNA. These results suggest that disruption of the function of TOPO II, subsequent to intercalation, is a probable mechanism by which pyridoacridines inhibit the proliferation of HCT cells. Evidence for DNA intercalation by AD41 is provided by the observation that the drug introduces positive supercoils into covalently closed plasmid DNA. Based on these data, a hypothesis is proposed that would provide a general mechanism whereby intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins alter topoisomerase function and presumably exert their antitumor effects. Therefore, to more fully analyze structure-function relationships and the role of DNA binding in the action of m-AMSA, we analyzed a series of derivatives for the ability to enhance DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ and to intercalate DNA. Results indicate that the 3&apos;-methoxy (m-AMSA) positively affects drug function, potentially by restricting the rotation of the headgroup in a favorable orientation."

Can life style changes reduce oxidative stress,yes,"The CFS group had an unfavorable lipid profile and signs of oxidative stress induced damage to lipids and proteins. These results might be indicative of early proatherogenic processes in this group of patients who are otherwise at low risk for atherosclerosis. Antioxidant treatment and life style changes are indicated for women with CFS, as well as closer observation in order to assess the degree of atherosclerosis. Once detected, these patients may be offered more aggressive treatment strategies such as early pharmacotherapy in addition to life style changes targeted to maintaining pericyte integrity. Our results suggested that life style changes which related to migration might reduce DNA damage in Hasake nationalities. Low levels of antioxidants and increased oxidative stress with insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome suggests that besides therapeutic life style changes (TLC) as suggested in ATP III guidelines inclusion of antioxidant vitamins, fruits and vegetable could be beneficial to ward off the consequences of metabolic syndrome."
Is the Dictyostelium discoideum proteome known?,yes,"The Negative Proteome Database (NPD) is populated with pair-wise protein sequence comparisons between each of the following proteomes: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium discoideum, Chlamydomonus reinhardti, Escherichia coli K12, Arabidopsis thaliana and Methanoscarcina acetivorans. The Dictyostelium discoideum proteome--the SWISS-2DPAGE database of the multicellular aggregate (slug). Consequently, this genomic sequence information can now be exploited to realize D. discoideum proteomics projects.  The Dictyostelium discoideum genome has been sequenced, assembled and annotated to a high degree of reliability. The parts-list of proteins and RNA encoded by the six chromosomes can now be accessed and analyzed.  The 34 Mb genome of Dictyostelium discoideum is carried on 6 chromosomes and has been fully sequenced by an international consortium. The sequence was assembled on the classical and physical maps that had been built up over the years and refined by HAPPY mapping. Annotation of the sequence predicted about 12,000 genes for proteins of at least 50 amino acids in length. In this study, a quantitative comparative proteomics approach has been used to analyze the Dictyostelium discoideum mitochondrial proteome variations during vegetative growth, starvation and the early stages of development.  The secreted proteome profile of developing Dictyostelium discoideum cells. The present repertoire validates our purification method and paves the way for a future proteomics approach to study the dynamics of macropinocytosis.

Isn't apixaban effective for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism?,no,"Apixaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, and is a potential alternative for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism.  These results suggest a lack of clear superiority of apixaban relative to enoxaparin. Apixaban is an oral alternative with similar efficacy and safety to existing anticoagulant therapies. A fixed-dose regimen of apixaban alone was noninferior to conventional therapy for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and was associated with significantly less bleeding To critically review the effectiveness of the novel oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, ximelagatran, and apixaban) in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. ompared with vitamin K antagonists, the novel oral anticoagulants had a similar risk of recurrence of acute venous thromboembolism and all cause mortality, though rivaroxaban was associated with a reduced risk of bleeding Nowadays, the new anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, show potential advantages over classical treatments. These agents inhibit specific coagulation factors and are administered orally at fixed doses. In a recently completed phase III trial, apixaban also demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in that indication the most advanced oral direct inhibitors to factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and IIa (dabigatran)"
Is the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle affected in inflammation?,yes,"In this study, the levels of amino acids and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) cycle-related molecules in the colonic tissues and sera of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) were profiled by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), with the aim of evaluating whether the clinical state induced by UC leads to variations in the amino acid profile Our study raises the possibility that GC/MS-based profiling of amino acids and TCA cycle-related molecules is a useful early diagnostic tool for UC. Succinate is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and plays a crucial role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in mitochondria. In plasma, most metabolites in the central metabolic pathway (glycolysis and TCA cycle) were significantly downregulated after zymosan administration Thus, IL-1beta+TNFalpha treated astrocytes show a marked decrease in glycogen levels, a slight but not significant decrease in lactate release as well as a massive increase in both the pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle activities. A total of 77 and 92 metabolites were detected in serum and colon tissue, respectively, and among the metabolites the compositions of TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids changed depending on the degree of colitis Extension of these findings identified a functional role for stretch-induced inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in mediating normoxic HIF1A stabilization, concomitant increases in glycolytic capacity, and improved tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function These studies reveal a surprising role for HIF1A in lung protection during ALI, where normoxic HIF1A stabilization and HIF-dependent control of alveolar-epithelial glucose metabolism function as an endogenous feedback loop to dampen lung inflammation These results suggest a cataplerosis of the TCA cycle induced by phenobarbital, caused by the massive withdrawal of succinyl-CoA by ALAS induction, such that the TCA cycle is unable to supply the reduced cofactors to the RC The mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were explored in the Hmbs(-/-) mouse model. RC and TCA cycle were significantly affected in comparison to controls in mice treated with phenobarbital with decreased activities of RC complexes Several changes in substrate utilization for energy homeostasis were identified in severe AAH, including increased glucose consumption by the pentose phosphate pathway, altered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, and enhanced peptide catabolism.  Enhanced mitochondrial glucose oxidation was achieved by increased recruitment of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1) to nuclear and mitochondrial genes that encode respiratory chain components and by NOTCH-dependent induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (Pdp1) expression, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and glucose flux to the TCA cycle.  Metabolic reprogramming is implicated in macrophage activation, BHB blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome without undergoing oxidation in the TCA cycle, and independently of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), the G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A or hydrocaboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2).  Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of caloric restriction or ketogenic diets may be linked to BHB-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,yes,"Ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been developed for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia in postmenopausal women.  For the comparison of short-term ospemifene with placebo, parabasal cells (the standardized mean difference [SMD] = -37.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -41.83 to -33.17, P < 0.00001), superficial cells (SMD = 9.24, 95% CI = 7.70 to 10.79, P < 0.00001), vaginal PH (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.80, P = 0.00001), and dyspareunia (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.30, P = 0.00001) indicated that ospemifene was more effective than the placebo.  This meta-analysis indicates that ospemifene to be an effective and safe treatment for dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist, that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal women. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the oral, non-estrogen agent ospemifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue-selective effects (also called a selective estrogen receptor modulator) that was recently approved for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Here, we review the estrogen agonist/antagonist profile of ospemifene, a novel triphenylethylene derivative recently approved to treat dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) due to menopause, both preclinically and clinically.  Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking.  Ospemifene is a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. SERMs with positive vaginal effects (such as improvement in the vaginal maturation index, reduced vaginal pH, and improvement in the signs and symptoms of VVA) on postmenopausal symptomatic women include lasofoxifene (clinical development on hold) and ospemifene, which was recently approved for the treatment of VVA-related dyspareunia, with a class effect warning of potential venous thrombosis risk.  Ospemifene is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ospemifene leading to this first approval for moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The aim of this work was to study the role of ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia and physiological vaginal changes.  In this study, once-daily oral ospemifene 60 mg was effective for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia. Clinical trials have confirmed that daily doses are well-tolerated and that it is effective in normalizing vaginal maturation index and pH as well as improving the symptoms associated with VVA including dyspareunia. Ospemifene was shown to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of the symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with vulvovaginal atrophy over and above the use of provided lubricants."
Can't zinc finger nucleases be used to combat disease?,no,"Genetic engineering has emerged as a powerful mechanism for understanding biological systems and a potential approach for redressing congenital disease. This is of particular importance, given the momentum currently behind ZFNs in moving into phase I clinical trials. This study provides a historical account of the origins of ZFN technology, an analysis of current techniques and applications, and an examination of the ethical issues applicable to translational ZFN genetic engineering in early phase clinical trials. This broad range of tractable species renders ZFNs a useful tool for improving the understanding of complex physiological systems, to produce transgenic animals, cell lines, and plants, and to treat human disease. We observe comparably high frequencies in human T cells, raising the possibility of strategies based on zinc-finger nucleases for the treatment of disease.

The major gene for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase RET. The RET proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in Hirschsprung disease.  Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a developmental disorder characterized by the absence of enteric neurons in distal segments of the gut, shows a complex pattern of inheritance, with the RET protooncogene acting as a major gene and additional susceptibility loci playing minor roles.  Traditional RET germline mutations account for a small subset of Hirschsprung disease patients, but several studies have shown that there is a specific haplotype of RET associated with the sporadic forms of Hirschsprung disease. PURPOSE: The RET proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in Hirschsprung disease. The RET proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung (HSCR), a complex genetic disease characterized by lack of ganglia along variable lengths of the gut.

BACKGROUND: The RET gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in different human neurocristopathies, such as specific neuroendocrine tumours and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). The first major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease is the RET proto-oncogene on 10q11.2. The developmental abnormalities apparent in these mice, together with the observation that the major tissues affected in MEN 2 and Hirschsprung disease have a common origin in the embryonal neural crest, suggest that RET encodes a receptor for a developmental regulator involved in the genesis of a variety of neural crest derivatives, and in the organogenesis of the kidney.

is intense physical activity associated with longevity ?,yes,"We found a very significant increase in average longevity (17%) of the cyclists when compared with the general population. The age at which 50% of the general population died was 73.5 vs. 81.5 years in Tour de France participants. Our major finding is that repeated very intense exercise prolongs life span in well trained practitioners. Competitive exercise does not induce cardiac damage in individuals with healthy hearts, but does induce physiological functional and structural cardiac adaptations which have positive effects on life expectancy. Medallists lived an average of 2.8 years longer than controls. Medallists in eight of the nine country groups had a significant survival advantage compared with controls. Gold, silver, and bronze medallists each enjoyed similar sized survival advantages. Medallists in endurance sports and mixed sports had a larger survival advantage over controls at 30 years (1.13, 1.09 to 1.17; 1.11, 1.09 to 1.13) than that of medallists in power sports (1.05, 1.01 to 1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Olympic medallists live longer than the general population, irrespective of country, medal, or sport. This study was not designed to explain this effect, but possible explanations include genetic factors, physical activity, healthy lifestyle, and the wealth and status that come with international sporting glory. Long-term endurance training induces in elderly subjects an increased HRV and a higher exercise working capacity, which are well-established predictors of cardiovascular and overall mortality. Sports activity in adolescents and young adults was associated with an increased risk of SD, both in males and females. Sports, per se, was not a cause of the enhanced mortality, but it triggered SD in those athletes who were affected by cardiovascular conditions predisposing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during physical exercise."
Can't a given genotype exhibit opposite fitness effects (beneficial and detrimental) within the same environment?,no,"Mutations beneficial in one environment may cause costs in different environments, resulting in antagonistic pleiotropy. Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates. The hfq mutations were beneficial, deleterious or neutral at an intermediate growth rate (0.5 h(-1)) and one changed from beneficial to deleterious within a 36 min difference in doubling time. Two genetic models exist to explain the evolution of ageing - mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). Under AP, late-acting deleterious mutations accumulate because they confer beneficial effects early in life. Many marker loci responded in opposite directions to selection for late- and early-life fitness, indicating negative genetic correlations or trade-offs between those traits. Indirect evidence suggested that some negative genetic correlations were due to antagonistic pleiotropy. Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates. The basis of antagonistic pleiotropy in hfq mutations that have opposite effects on fitness at slow and fast growth rates. Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates"
Is TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease in humans?,yes,"Genetic deficits and loss of function for the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2; encoded at chr6p21.1), a transmembrane spanning stimulatory receptor of the immunoglobulin/lectin-like gene superfamily, have been associated with deficiencies in phagocytosis and the innate immune system in Alzheimer's disease. Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis. TREM2 is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Spanish population. Two recent studies have reported the association of rs75932628-T in the TREM2 gene with the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). we report the first positive replication study in a Spanish population and confirm that TREM2 rs75932628-T is associated with the risk for AD. (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we examined the association between TREM2 exon 2 variants and early-onset AD in a sample of Caucasian subjects of French origin including 726 patients with age of onset ≤65 years and 783 controls. We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.001). Our findings strongly implicate variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's disease Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an odds ratio similar to that of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. The rs75932628-T variant of the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACKGROUND: Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous rare variants in TREM2 are associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: A rare missense mutation (rs75932628-T) in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which was predicted to result in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease in Iceland (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09 to 4.09; P=3.42×10(-10))."
Have mutations in the Polycomb group been found in human diseases?,yes,"We identify a novel mutation in PHC1, a human orthologue of the Drosophila polyhomeotic member of polycomb group (PcG), which significantly decreases PHC1 protein expression, increases Geminin protein level and markedly abolishes the capacity to ubiquitinate histone H2A in patient cells. In clinical specimens of head and neck cancer, we found that coamplification of BMI1 and AURKA correlated with poorer prognosis. Mutations of EZH2, RUNX1, TP53, and ASXL1 were associated with shorter overall survival independent of the LR-PSS. In this study, we show the high frequency of spontaneous γδ T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) occurrence in mice with biallelic deletion of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2). Subsequently, analysis of deletion profiles of other PRC2 members revealed frequent losses of genes such as EZH2, AEBP2, and SUZ12; however, the deletions targeting these genes were large. We also identified two patients with homozygous losses of JARID2 and AEBP2. We observed frequent codeletion of AEBP2 and ETV6, and similarly, SUZ12 and NF1. A total of 25 different EZH2 mutations were detected in 5.9% of PMF, 1.2% of PPV-MF, and 9.4% of PET-MF patients; most were exonic heterozygous missense changes. In the present investigation we have focused on the candidate region in 6p23, a region that have been found linked to CL/P in several investigations, in the attempt to find out the susceptibility gene provisionally named OFC1. Gene expression experiments in mice embryo of positional candidate genes revealed that JARID2 was highly and specifically expressed in epithelial cells in merging palatal shelves. High expression of EZH2 and amplification of EZH2 was found in 54.1% and 12.0% of ESCCs, respectively. We also observed that HOXA9 levels were significantly inversely correlated with survival and that BMI-1 was overexpressed in cases with 11q23 rearrangements, suggesting that p19(ARF) suppression may be involved in MLL-associated leukemia. We demonstrate that in multiple experimental models of metastatic prostate cancer both BMI1 and Ezh2 genes are amplified and gene amplification is associated with increased expression of corresponding mRNAs and proteins. he EZH2 gene amplification was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with increased EZH2 protein expression. The third tumor showed a t(6p;10q;10p) as the sole karyotypic abnormality, leading to the fusion of PHF1 with another partner, the enhancer of polycomb (EPC1) gene from 10p11; EPC1 has hitherto not been associated with neoplasia."

Is microRNA(miRNA) 29 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,yes,"Myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced remodelling generally includes cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), myocyte hypertrophy, angiogenesis, cardiac fibrosis, and myocardial dysfunction. I In addition, miR-21, -24, -133, -210, -494, and -499 appear to protect myocytes against I/R-induced apoptosis, whereas miR-1, -29, -199a, and -320 promote apoptosis Myocardial fibrosis can be regulated by the miR-29 family Studies using various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models have suggested the possible involvement of miR-1, miR-21, miR-29, miR-92a, miR-133, miR-199a, and miR-320 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction. Among the MI-regulated miRNAs are members of the miR-29 family, which are down-regulated in the region of the heart adjacent to the infarct. The miR-29 family targets a cadre of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in fibrosis, including multiple collagens, fibrillins, and elastin. Thus, down-regulation of miR-29 would be predicted to derepress the expression of these mRNAs and enhance the fibrotic response. Indeed, down-regulation of miR-29 with anti-miRs in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of collagens, whereas over-expression of miR-29 in fibroblasts reduces collagen expression. We conclude that miR-29 acts as a regulator of cardiac fibrosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for tissue fibrosis in general."
Isn't Vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,no,"Vortioxetine is an orally administered small molecule developed by Lundbeck A/S for the once-daily treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Vortioxetine received its first global approval for MDD in the USA in September 2013 and regulatory approval for its use in this indication in the EU (where it has received a positive opinion) and Canada is awaited.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of vortioxetine leading to this first approval for MDD. Vortioxetine was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. On the primary efficacy endpoint, both vortioxetine doses were statistically significantly superior to placebo, with a mean difference to placebo (n=158) of -5.5 (vortioxetine 15 mg, P<0.0001, n=149) and -7.1 MADRS points (vortioxetine 20 mg, P<0.0001, n=151). The change in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was maintained throughout the study as reflected by a 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale total score of 8.2 at week 52 (from 17.6 at open-label baseline) in the observed case data set. Vortioxetine is a multi-modal antidepressant that functions as a human 5-HT3A and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and inhibitor of the serotonin transporter.  Approval for the treatment of MDD was based on a clinical development programme that included six positive 6-8 week studies, including one study in elderly people, and one positive maintenance study in adults. Vortioxetine represents another option for the treatment of MDD.  The multimodal compounds vortioxetine and vilazodone are examples of this approach with diverse mechanisms, and their different clinical effects will provide valuable insights into serotonergic modulation of glutamate transmission for the potential treatment of depression and associated cognitive dysfunction. Two new antidepressant drugs, vilazodone (marketed in the USA) and vortioxetine (in development) incorporate partial 5-HT1A-R agonist properties with SERT blockade. Novel drugs in development include those that combine multiple simultaneous pharmacologic mechanisms in addition to SERT inhibition within the same molecule, such as vilazodone (combining 5HT1A partial agonism with SERT inhibition), triple reuptake inhibitors (combining norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition with SERT inhibition), and vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant combining actions at the G protein receptor mode (5HT1A and 5HT1B partial agonism and 5HT7 antagonism), at the ion channel mode (5HT3 antagonism) as well as the neurotransmitter transporter mode (SERT inhibition).  In this study of adults with MDD treated for 8 weeks with vortioxetine 2.5 mg or 5 mg per day, reductions in depression symptoms were not statistically significant compared with placebo.  However, on the basis of these findings, vortioxetine (2.5, 5, 10 mg/day) demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile and maintained effectiveness over 12 months of treatment.  In this study of adults with MDD, 5 mg vortioxetine did not differ significantly from placebo in reducing depression symptoms after 6 wk of treatment. After 8 weeks of treatment with Lu AA21004 10 mg, there was a significant reduction in HDRS-24 total score compared with placebo in adults with MDD. In conclusion, Lu AA21004 was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of elderly patients with recurrent major depressive disorder. Thus, Lu AA21004 was effective in preventing relapse of MDD and was well tolerated as maintenance treatment.  Findings on secondary outcome measures, using MMRM instead of LOCF, were supportive of likely efficacy for Lu AA21004 5mg and 10mg and duloxetine.  In this study, treatment with 5 mg and 10 mg Lu AA21004 for 6 wk was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with MDD. Results from phase II clinical trials have reported improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment."
Isn't exome sequencing efficient for the detection of germline mutations?,no,"Whole exome sequencing is an efficient and sensitive method for detection of germline mutations in patients with phaeochromcytomas and paragangliomas Whole exome sequencing is sensitive, rapid and efficient for detection of PCC/PGL germline mutations. These results from deep sequencing demonstrate a higher mutational detection rate than reported with conventional sequencing methodology. We performed exome sequencing of germline DNA from members of the affected family. Exome-wide analysis identified a novel loss-of-function mutation in the BAP1 gene, previously suggested as a tumor suppressor. whole-exome sequencing has been widely applied in the identification of germline mutations underlying Mendelian disorders, somatic mutations in various cancers and de novo mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders."
Isn't it feasible to determine the complete proteome of yeast?,no,"or model organisms like yeast, we can now quantify complete proteomes in just a few hours. A complete mass-spectrometric map of the yeast proteome applied to quantitative trait analysis. So far, attempts to generate such maps for any proteome have failed to reach complete proteome coverage. Here we use a strategy based on high-throughput peptide synthesis and mass spectrometry to generate an almost complete reference map (97% of the genome-predicted proteins) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome."
Is the yeast Μac1 transcription factor induced upon copper deficiency?,yes,"Low-affinity copper transporter CTR2 is regulated by copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p Taken together, our results suggest that Mac1p can activate the expression of vacuolar copper transporter Ctr2p in response to copper deficiency, resulting in yeast resistance to copper starvation. The ablation of either MAC1 or AFT1 also abrogated CTR2 expression induced by copper depletion Our further study revealed that exogenous Aft1p upregulates CTR2 transcription only in the presence of Mac1p, whereas exogenous Mac1p upregulates CTR2 transcription only in the presence of Aft1p. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional responses to copper deficiency are mediated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1 Although Mac1 activates the transcription of genes involved in high affinity copper uptake during periods of deficiency, little is known about the mechanisms by which Mac1 senses or responds to reduced copper availability.  The catalytic activity of Sod1 is essential for Mac1 activation and promotes a regulated increase in binding of Mac1 to copper response elements in the promoter regions of genomic Mac1 target genes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copper ions regulate gene expression through the two transcriptional activators, Ace1 and Mac1. Ace1 mediates copper-induced gene expression in cells exposed to stressful levels of copper salts, whereas Mac1 activates a subset of genes under copper-deficient conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that Mac1p can activate the expression of vacuolar copper transporter Ctr2p in response to copper deficiency, resulting in yeast resistance to copper starvation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional responses to copper deficiency are mediated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p. The yeast Mac1 protein is a copper-sensing transcription factor that is essential for both the activation and inactivation of genes required for high affinity copper ion transport. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.  Copper-mediated repression of the activation domain in the yeast Mac1p transcription factor. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.  In this study, we found that copper depletion can upregulate yeast CTR2 gene transcription while copper overload downregulate it. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p."
Isn't alemtuzumab effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia?,no,"Sequential chemoimmunotherapy of fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide induction followed by alemtuzumab consolidation is effective in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia A central need in this historically refractory tumor is the controlled evaluation of multiagent chemotherapy and its combination with the currently most active single agent, alemtuzumab.  FMC-A is a safe and efficient protocol in T-PLL, which compares favorably to published data. Currently, the best treatment for T-PLL is IV alemtuzumab, which has resulted in very high response rates of more than 90% when given as frontline treatment and a significant improvement in survival.  The patient failed to respond to standard ALL induction chemotherapy, but achieved complete remission following treatment with a fludarabine and alemtuzumab-based regimen. Here we present a rare case of concurrent T-PLL and Kaposi sarcoma who achieved a complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after a very short course of treatment with alemtuzumab.  Recent studies with single-agent alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, have shown improved response rates and survival in patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  The CD52 antigen is expressed at high density on the malignant T-cells and therapy with alemtuzumab, a humanized IgG1 antibody that targets this antigen, has produced promising results.  With the introduction of alemtuzumab, most patients who progressed despite treatment with pentostatin had a major response with a complete remission rate higher than that obtained with pentostatin when used as a first line. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52, Campath-1H) has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of a range of hematological malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Here we report the outcome of two patients with CD4-positive T cell prolymphocytic leukemia treated with CAMPATH-1H. Both patients responded rapidly to treatment and subsequently developed CD4 lymphopenia. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy with a median survival of 7.5 months. Preliminary results indicated a high remission induction rate with the human CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H.  CAMPATH-1H (30 mg) was administered intravenously 3 times weekly until maximal response. The overall response rate was 76% with 60% CR and 16% partial remission (PR). These responses were durable with a median disease-free interval of 7 months (range, 4-45 months).  The conclusion is that CAMPATH-1H is an effective therapy in T-PLL, producing remissions in more than two thirds of patients.  For example, most patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, including those with large tumor burdens and high peripheral white blood cell counts, will enter complete remission using the antibody CAMPATH-1H without any evidence of tumor lysis. Overall response rate to FMC was 68%, comprising 6 complete remissions (all bone-marrow confirmed) and 11 partial remissions. Alemtuzumab consolidation increased the intent-to-treat overall response rate to 92% (12 complete remissions; 11 partial remissions)."
Is bapineuzumab effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease?,no,"Thus far, results from two large phase 3 trial programs with bapineuzumab and solaneuzumab, respectively, have brought rather disappointing results. More recently, in phase III studies, bapineuzumab has been discontinued because it did not prove clinically effective (despite its significant effect on biomarkers), while solaneuzumab has been found effective in slowing AD progression.  Passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Aβ is in late clinical development but recently the two most advanced mAbs, Bapineuzumab and Solanezumab, targeting an N-terminal or central epitope, respectively, failed to meet their target of improving or stabilizing cognition and function. The marginal effects observed in recent clinical studies of solanezumab, targeting monomeric Aβ, and bapineuzumab, targeting amyloid plaques, prompted expert comments that drug discovery efforts in Alzheimer's disease should focus on soluble forms of Aβ rather than fibrillar Aβ deposits found in amyloid plaques. Phase III trials showed that bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive and functional performances in AD patients, and was associated with a high incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Clinical trials on various drugs, including AN1792, bapineuzumab, and solanezumab, have been carried out; however, all trials have failed to demonstrate apparent clinical benefits.  Despite the alteration in biochemical composition, all 3 immunized subjects exhibited continued cognitive decline. Despite negative topline phase 3 clinical trial results for bapineuzumab and solanezumab in mild to moderate AD, findings from these trials and recent advances suggest renewed optimism for anti-amyloid therapies.  The lack of progress in the development of disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was highlighted recently by the cessation of a phase 3 clinical trial studying the effects of bapineuzumab on mild to moderate disease. No treatment benefit was apparent, whereas several serious side effects occurred more commonly in the treatment group compared to placebo.  Clinical studies using the N-terminal-directed anti-Aβ antibody bapineuzumab have demonstrated reduced brain PET-Pittsburg-B signals, suggesting the reduction of Aβ plaques, and reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein in the CSF of treated AD patients. Preclinical studies using 3D6 (the murine form of bapineuzumab) have demonstrated resolution of Aβ plaque and vascular burdens, neuritic dystrophy, and preservation of synaptic density in the transgenic APP mouse models. The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E ε4 carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the Aβ peptide.   The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, composed of humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, that has been tested in two Phase II trials, demonstrating to reduce Aβ burden in the brain of AD patients. However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab appears uncertain. The occurrence of vasogenic edema, especially in apolipoprotein E 4 carriers, may limit its clinical use and have led to abandon the highest dose of the drug (2 mg/kg). However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain. Moreover, the occurrence of vasogenic edema and, more rarely, brain microhemorrhages, especially in apolipoprotein E ϵ4 carriers, have led to abandoning of the highest dose of the drug.  However, the preliminary equivocal cognitive results obtained with bapineuzumab as well as the detrimental cognitive effects observed with semagacestat, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor, raise the possibility that targeting Aβ may not be clinically efficacious in AD.  The patient received four bapineuzumab infusions over a 39 week period. During the course of this treatment, there was no remarkable change in cognitive impairment as determined by MMSE scores. Forty-eight days after the fourth bapineuzumab infusion was given, MRI revealed that the patient had developed lacunar infarcts and possible vasogenic edema, probably related to immunotherapy, but a subsequent MRI scan 38 days later demonstrated resolution of vasogenic edema. The patient expired due to acute congestive heart failure complicated by progressive AD and cerebrovascular accident 378 days after the first bapineuzumab infusion and 107 days after the end of therapy. Neuropathological and biochemical analysis did not produce evidence of lasting plaque regression or clearance of Aβ due to immunotherapy. These results suggest that, in this particular case, bapineuzumab immunotherapy neither resulted in detectable clearance of amyloid plaques nor prevented further cognitive impairment. Bapineuzumab has been shown to reduce Aβ burden in the brain of AD patients. However, its preliminary cognitive efficacy appears uncertain, particularly in ApoE ε4 carriers, and vasogenic edema may limit its clinical use.  Bapineuzumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral beta-amyloid peptide burden in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, particularly in APOE 4 carriers, its ability to slow disease progression remains uncertain, and vasogenic edema - a dose-limiting and potentially severe adverse reaction - may limit its clinical applicability. The first is a phase 2 study of passive immunotherapy with bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminus of Abeta. This trial showed no differences within dose cohorts on the primary efficacy analysis. Exploratory analyses showed potential treatment differences on cognitive and functional endpoints in study completers and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 noncarriers. A safety concern was the occurrence of reversible vasogenic edema.  The first passive immunotherapy trial with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the end terminus of Abeta, also encountered some dose dependent adverse events during the Phase II portion of the study, vasogenic edema in 12 cases, which were significantly over represented in ApoE4 carriers."
Is cadasil syndrome a hereditary disease?,yes,"CADASIL is the most frequent hereditary small-vessel disease of the brain. The clinical impact of various MR imaging markers has been repeatedly studied in this disorder, but alterations of contrast between gray matter and normal-appearing white matter remain unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contrast alterations between gray matter and normal-appearing white matter on T1-weighted images in patients with CADASIL compared with healthy subjects  (CADASIL) is the most common form of hereditary cerebral angiopathy Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited cerebral small vessel disease, clinically characterized by migraine, recurrent transient ischemic attacks or strokes, psychiatric disorders and cognitive decline.

Is nintedanib effective for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?,yes,"In this review, we present the positive results of recently published clinical trials regarding therapy for IPF, with emphasis on pirfenidone and nintedanib. Nintedanib: evidence for its therapeutic potential in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  In the Phase II TOMORROW trial, treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily showed a trend to slow the decline in lung function and significantly decrease acute exacerbations in patients with IPF, while showing an acceptable safety profile. The Phase III INPULSIS trials demonstrated a significant decrease in the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity in IPF patients treated with 150 mg nintedanib twice daily. In the INPULSIS-2 trial, the time to the first acute exacerbation significantly increased in IPF patients who were treated with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily.  Effects on collagen secretion were compared with those of the drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone, recently approved for IPF. Nintedanib, an orally available, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selectivity for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors has recently been shown, in two pivotal phase III studies, to effectively slow IPF disease progression. Consequently, nintedanib was given accelerated approval by the FDA in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  Most recently, pirfenidone and nintedanib, two compounds with pleiotropic anti-fibrotic properties, have been proven effective in reducing functional decline and disease progression in IPF.  Meningococcal group B vaccine (Trumenba) to prevent more types of invasive meningococcal disease; antihemophilic factor (recombinant), porcine sequence (Obizur) to treat bleeding from acquired hemophilia A; and pirfenidone (Esbriet) and nintedanib (Ofev) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  More importantly, the period ends with the publication of two groundbreaking studies that confirmed that two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, slowed disease progression, leading to a historic approval by the FDA.  Nintedanib (Ofev(®)) is an orally available, small, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and cancer. Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF. Nintedanib has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of IPF, and for the second-line treatment in combination with docetaxel of locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma tumour histology.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of nintedanib leading to this first approval for IPF. Efficacy and safety of nintedanib in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib: a novel therapeutic approach for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib is in clinical development as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Reducing lung function decline in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: potential of nintedanib. These results suggest that nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Findings from recently published placebo-controlled trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have established that pirfenidone and nintedanib prevent about 50% of the decline in forced vital capacity typically seen in this disease; future trials are therefore unlikely to use placebo as a control group for ethical reasons. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is in clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Data from the Phase II TOMORROW study suggested that nintedanib 150�mg twice daily had clinical benefits with an acceptable safety profile.METHODS: The INPULSIS� trials are replicate Phase III, randomized, double-blind, studies comparing the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150�mg twice daily with placebo in patients with IPF.  Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  The most frequent adverse event in the nintedanib groups was diarrhea, with rates of 61.5% and 18.6% in the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-1 and 63.2% and 18.3% in the two groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-2. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nintedanib reduced the decline in FVC, which is consistent with a slowing of disease progression; nintedanib was frequently associated with diarrhea, which led to discontinuation of the study medication in less than 5% of patients.  A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We conducted two replicate 52-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials (INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily as compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Does PU.1 (SPI1) affect NF-kB binding?,yes,"Recent data demonstrate that developmental transcription factors like the macrophage fate-determining Pu.1 set the stage for the activity of ubiquitous transcription factors activated by inflammatory stimuli, like NF-kB, AP-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Within 1217 bp of upstream sequence, 3 sites for NF-kB, 10 sites for NF-IL6, 15 sites for AP1, 6 sites for AP4, 2 sites for CHOP/CEBP alpha and 1 site for SP1 and PU.1 were identified. As little as 82 bp of upstream sequence gave relatively strong luciferase activity, a region containing both a PU.1 and NF-kB site. Potential transcription regulatory elements, AP1, AP2, AP3, NF-kB and GATA recognition sequences, are located within 523 bp upstream of the p35 gene; however, no TATA box was identified. The p40 subunit gene consists of eight exons. A TATA box is located 30 bp upstream from the transcription start site, and AP1, AP3, GATA, and Pu.1 recognition sequences are located within 690 bp upstream of the p40 gene. Several putative binding sequences for ubiquitous (Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and NF-kB) and leukocyte-specific (PU.1) transcription factors have been identified in the proximal region of the CD11c promoter which may participate in the regulation of the expression of p150,95. PU.1 is regulated by NF-kappaB through a novel binding site in a 17 kb upstream enhancer element."

Can't botulism poisoning of a pregnant woman harm her fetus?,yes,"Two botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. Three affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Botulinum toxin is not expected to be present in systemic circulation following proper intramuscular or intradermal injection. Moreover, BTX-A, which has a high molecular weight, does not appear to cross the placenta. From the 38 pregnancies reported in the literature, including women who had botulism poisoning during pregnancy, exposure to BTX-A does not appear to increase the risk of adverse outcome in the fetus.

Can protein coding exons originate from ALU sequences?,yes,"The Alu element has been a major source of new exons during primate evolution. Thousands of human genes contain spliced exons derived from Alu elements. More than 25% of Alu exons analyzed by RNA-Seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of Alu exons in human genes. his study presents genomic evidence that a major functional consequence of Alu exonization is the lineage-specific evolution of translational regulation. Our data suggests that lineage-specific exonization events should be determined by the combination event of the formation of splicing sites and protection against site-specific mutation pressures. These evolutionary mechanisms could be major sources for primate diversification. Exonization of Alu elements creates primate-specific genomic diversity Our data show that, once acquired, some exonizations were lost again in some lineages. In general, Alu exonization occurred at various time points over the evolutionary history of primate lineages, and protein-coding potential was acquired either relatively soon after integration or millions of years thereafter. Once integrated, they have the potential to become exapted as functional modules, e.g., as protein-coding domains via alternative splicing. This particular process is also termed exonization and increases protein versatility alternative ""Alu-exons"" also carry the potential to greatly enhance genetic diversity by increasing the transcriptome of primates chiefly via alternative splicing. ere, we report a 5' exon generated from one of the two alternative transcripts in human tumor necrosis factor receptor gene type 2 (p75TNFR) that contains an ancient Alu-SINE, which provides an alternative N-terminal protein-coding domain."
Isn't there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,no,"The hypocholesterolemic effect of tomato juice has been investigated in an intervention study with rats, along with the possible inhibition effect of bioactive tomato compounds binding to the HMGCR enzyme. The molecular modelling showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCR.  Juice consumption significantly improved resistance of LDL+VLDL-C to Cu(2+)-mediated oxidation (P = 0.039), HDL-C (47.3 ± 15.8 to 51.7 ± 14.8 mg/dL, P<0.001), and the ratio of total-C/HDL-C (4.25 ± 1.59 to 3.63 ± 1.16, P<0.001) at 8 wk. RESULTS: Intervention with the enriched juice had no effect on the lipid profile, and serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL) remained unchanged.  Women consuming ≥10 compared with<1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L; P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P<0.001) in multivariable models. Considering clinical cutpoints, women consuming ≥10 compared with<1.5 servings/wk were 31% (95% CI = 6%, 50%), 40% (95% CI = 13%, 59%), and 66% (95% CI = 20%, 86%) less likely to have elevated TC (≥6.21 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol (≥4.14 mmol/L), and hemoglobin A1c (≥6%), respectively.  In conclusion, women consuming ≥10 compared with<1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had clinically modest but significant improvements in TC, the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio, and hemoglobin A1c but not other coronary biomarkers. Tomato juice decreases LDL cholesterol levels and increases LDL resistance to oxidation. Total cholesterol concentration was reduced by 5.9 (sd 10) % (P = 0.002) and LDL cholesterol concentration by 12.9 (sd 17.0) % (P = 0.0002) with the high tomato diet compared to the low tomato diet. In conclusion, a high dietary intake of tomato products had atheroprotective effects, it significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels, and increased LDL resistance to oxidation in healthy normocholesterolaemic adults. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice Total cholesterol concentration was reduced by 5.9 (sd 10) % (P = 0.002) and LDL cholesterol concentration by 12.9 (sd 17.0) % (P = 0.0002) with the high tomato diet compared to the low tomato diet."
Are there transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes?,yes,"Transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes. Despite the presence of over 3 million transposons separated on average by approximately 500 bp, the human and mouse genomes each contain almost 1000 transposon-free regions (TFRs) over 10 kb in length. The majority of human TFRs correlate with orthologous TFRs in the mouse, despite the fact that most transposons are lineage specific. Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation. All three elements insert only rarely within many Polycomb-regulated regions, a property that may contribute to the origin of ""transposon-free regions"" (TFRs) in metazoan genomes. Despite the presence of over 3 million transposons separated on average by approximately 500 bp, the human and mouse genomes each contain almost 1000 transposon-free regions (TFRs) over 10 kb in length. RESULTS: Here we report that transposon-free regions (TFRs) are prominent genomic features of amphibian and fish lineages, and that many have been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution, although most transposon-derived sequences have entered these lineages after their divergence.

Is there a role for the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) in lung cancer?,yes,"Over-expressing CYLD augments antitumor activity of TRAIL by inhibiting the NF-κB survival signaling in lung cancer cells increased expression of CYLD directly blocks TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation, and consequently increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. CYLD may act as a therapeutic target of lung cancer. Targeting CYLD, in combination with TRAIL, may be a new strategy to treat lung cancer with high NF-κB activity Truncation of the catalytic domain of the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor impairs lung maturation down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer Deletion of exon 9 would cause a carboxyl-terminal truncation of CYLD and inactivation of its deubiquitinating activity.

Have mutations in the GARS gene been identified to cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2D (CMT2D)?,yes,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D is a hereditary axonal and glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS)-associated neuropathy that is caused by a mutation in GARS.  Mutations in the GARS gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2D and distal spinal muscular atrophy type V - allelic disorders characterized by predominantly distal upper extremity weakness and atrophy, typically beginning during the second decade of life.  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) is a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by missense mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase gene (GARS). The 13 genes known to be associated with the CMT2 subtypes are KIF1B (CMT2A1), MFN2 (CMT2A2), RAB7A (formerly RAB7) (CMT2B), LMNA (CMT2B1), MED25 (CMT2B2), TRPV4 (CMTC), GARS (CMT2D), NEFL (CMT2E/1F), HSPB1 (CMT2F), MPZ (CMT2I/J), GDAP1 (CMT2H/K), HSPB8 (CMT2L), and AARS (CMT2N).   The diagnosis of GARS-associated axonal neuropathy is based on clinical findings, electromyography (EMG), and molecular genetic testing of GARS, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase. Sporadic juvenile muscular atrophy of the distal upper extremity or Hirayama's disease (HD) and autosomal dominant motor distal neuronopathy/axonopathy (CMT2D/dSMA-V), produced by glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene mutations, share some clinical features including: young age of onset, predilection for the distal upper extremity, asymmetry, sparing of proximal muscles and unusual cold sensitivity.  Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V (dHMN-V) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) type 2 presenting with predominant hand involvement, also known as CMT2D and Silver syndrome (SS) are rare phenotypically overlapping diseases which can be caused by mutations in the Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy 2 (BSCL2) and in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase encoding (GARS) genes.  We previously implicated mutations in the gene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) as the cause of CMT2D and dSMA-V. Of the many inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathies, type 2D (CMT2D) is caused by dominant point mutations in the gene GARS, encoding glycyl tRNA synthetase (GlyRS).  Missense mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene have been recently reported in families with either dHMN-V, CMT2D, or both. Based on the presence or absence of sensory changes, the disease phenotype was initially defined as distal spinal muscular atrophy type V (dSMA-V) in three families, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) in a single family, and as either dSMA-V or CMT2D in patients of another large family. Linkage to chromosome 7p15 and the presence of disease-associated heterozygous GARS mutations have been identified in patients from each of the five studied families."
Doesn't melanoma occur in people of African origin ?,no,"ALM is the most common type of melanoma amongst Asians, Africans, ALM develops on palmar, plantar, and subungual skin, and its biology is different from that of other cutaneous melanomas, where sunlight is the major known environmental determinant We present four albinos with histologic diagnoses of skin cancer Four Nigerian albinos (two men and two women) with skin cancer The sites of the lesions included the head [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in two patients and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in one patient] and the upper limb (melanoma wenty-nine patients (18 males and 11 females) with skin cancer were identified Kaposi sarcoma associated with HIV represented 81.8 percent of KS cases found. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) ranked second and malignant melanoma third Earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black Africans. In a series of melanomas from black Africans (n=26), only two BRAF mutations (8%) were found, both being different from the common T1799A substitution. Moreover, melanomas from black Africans exhibited mutations in NRAS exon 1 only (12%), whereas NRAS exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from Caucasians. Thus, the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations were particularly low in melanomas from black Africans, supporting a different pathogenesis of these tumors. Malignant melanoma (MM) remains a pediatric rarity world-wide, but perhaps more so in black Africans. To the best of our knowledge, the current report of MM in a two-and-a-half-year-old Nigerian who had a pre-existing congenital giant hairy nevus is probably the first (in an accessible literature) in a black African child. Malignant melanomas in black Africans are predominantly located on the lower extremities Thus, our findings indicate that melanomas located on the lower extremities in black Africans show several features of aggressiveness; in particular, the proliferative activity was high, and p16 alterations was frequent as evidenced by loss of protein staining. Our findings also indicated that the diagnosis is delayed among black Africans. Africans with dark skin have a reduced risk of getting all types of skin cancer as compared with Caucasians, but the ratio of their incidence rates of cutaneous malignant melanoma to that of squamous cell carcinoma is larger than the corresponding ratio for Caucasians. ( Albino Africans, as compared with normally pigmented Africans, seem to have a relatively small risk of getting cutaneous malignant melanomas compared to nonmelanomas. This is probably also true for albino and normally pigmented Caucasians. Scant data exists on melanoma in blacks from Africa The mean age at presentation of the 39 women and 24 men was 60.5 years (range of 30 to 85 years), with a peak incidence in the sixth decade. The foot was the most common site of disease (45 patients). Seven patients had subungual melanoma, seven had primary mucosal lesions, and in six, the primary lesion could not be found. The poor prognosis in black patients in South Africa is the result of delayed presentation with thick primary lesions and advanced disease The outcome of treatment in 40 black patients (27 women, 13 men; mean age 62.9 years) with plantar melanoma over a 13-year period was analysed Delay in presentation and locally advanced disease may explain the poor prognosis of plantar melanoma in black South Africans. Eighteen cases of malignant skin tumors seen at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital over 3 years (1984 to 1987) were analyzed for diagnoses, site of tumors, sex, and age. Seven patients (39%) had malignant melanomas affecting only the soles of the feet, while the same number had squamous cell carcinomas widely distributed in various parts of the body Non-white populations experienced in general a much lower incidence of melanoma although there was some overlap of white and non-white rates. Populations of African descent were found to have a higher incidence than those of Asiatic origin, but it was concluded that this was due largely to the high frequency of tumours among Africans on the sole of the foot. Pathological features of twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma studied in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during the period January, 1974 to December, 1975 are presented. Malignant melanoma accounted for 2.4% of all tumours and 4.5% of all malignant tumours, greatest age incidence being in the fifth to seventh decades. 81% melanomas occurred on the sole of feet validating the hypothesis that the pigmented skin in Africans is resistant to malignant melanoma. This paper reports the incidence of this lesion in association with invasive malignant melanomas of the feet and hands of Black Africans. Follow-up data (over a 3-year period) and the histological appearances of primary lesion were studied and related in 40 Black patients with malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma of the skin in Blacks in formidable and sinister tumour. The incidence of malignant melanoma in Johannesburg Black was 1,2 per 100 000 and accounted for 2% of all cancers. The largest number of cases occurred in the 50- 70-year age group and there was a female preponderance. As in previous studies, the sites predominantly affected were the foot and the hand, mainly on the plantar and palmar surfaces. Twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma occurring in the Igbos of Nigeria have been analysed. The site of predilection is the sole of the foot. This result supports the conclusion that Negroes tend to have the disease in the non-pigmented parts. A case of leptomeningeal melanoma in an African child of 7 years is presented together with a survey of pigmentation in the normal African brain."
Are people with blood group O protected against severe Malaria?,yes,"Differential carbonylation of cytoskeletal proteins in blood group O erythrocytes: potential role in protection against severe malaria. . Our findings indicate a possible correlation between the protection against severe malaria in blood group O individuals and a specific pattern of 4-HNE-carbonylation of cytoskeleton proteins. There is a predominance of blood group O in malaria-endemic regions, and several lines of evidence suggest that ABO blood groups may influence the outcome of P. falciparum infection These data provide the first evidence that ABO blood group antigens influence macrophage clearance of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and suggest an additional mechanism by which blood group O may confer resistance to severe malaria. Blood group phenotypes A and B are risk factors for cerebral malaria in Odisha, India. type O is significantly associated with protection against CM, patients with type A and B group had increased risk for developing CM. Blood group O protects against severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria through the mechanism of reduced rosetting. Malaria has been a major selective force on the human population, and several erythrocyte polymorphisms have evolved that confer resistance to severe malaria. Plasmodium falciparum rosetting, a parasite virulence phenotype associated with severe malaria, is reduced in blood group O erythrocytes compared with groups A, B, and AB, but the contribution of the ABO blood group system to protection against severe malaria has received little attention We hypothesized that blood group O may confer resistance to severe falciparum malaria through the mechanism of reduced rosetting. It appears that individuals who are of blood-group O are relatively resistant to the severe disease caused by P. falciparum infection."
Can't venlafaxine block NET and SERT?,no,"Treatment for 14 days with 70 mg/kg per day venlafaxine, which inhibits both the NET and SERT, or 10 mg/kg per day phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, produced antidepressant-like effects on behavior without altering NET or SERT expression. Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT. Chronic venlafaxine treatment affected SERT and NET binding differently from paroxetine or desipramine. Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT Paroxetine and venlafaxine are potent serotonin transporter (SERT) antagonists and weaker norepinephrine transporter (NET) antagonists Using a novel blood assay that estimates CNS transporter occupancy we estimated the relative SERT and NET occupancy of paroxetine and venlafaxine in human subjects to assess the relative magnitude of SERT and NET inhibition Treatment for 14 days with 70 mg/kg per day venlafaxine, which inhibits both the NET and SERT, or 10 mg/kg per day phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, produced antidepressant-like effects on behavior without altering NET or SERT expression We then performed the first reported investigation of epistasis between the SERT gene and norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2, alias NET) in AN, as an earlier study suggested that atypical AN responds to the dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine Of particular interest were the findings that paroxetine, generally thought of as a selective SERT antagonist, possesses moderately high affinity for the NET and that venlafaxine, which has been described as a &quot;dual uptake inhibitor&quot;, possesses weak affinity for the NET The ratios of measured occupancy ED(50) values (doses at which 50% occupancy occurs) among SERT, NET and DAT sites for duloxetine, venlafaxine, nomifensine, indatraline, DOV 21,947 and DOV 216,303 were consistent with the ratios of the in vitro affinities between these target binding sites SERT and NET occupancy by venlafaxine and milnacipran in nonhuman primates: a PET study In this study in nonhuman primates, we aimed to investigate the relationship between SERT and NET affinity by measuring the in vivo occupancy at both transporters of venlafaxine and milnacipran We hypothesized that venlafaxine would affect monoamine transporters dose-dependently, with low doses causing selective reduction of SERT binding sites and higher doses reducing both SERT and NET binding sites Comparative studies with clinically used antidepressants showed that venlafaxine possessed a profile similar to S33005 but was less potent. Clomipramine likewise interacted with SERTs and NETs but also with several other receptors types, while citalopram and reboxetine were preferential ligands of SERTs and NETs, respectively. In conclusion, S33005 interacts potently with SERTs and, less markedly, with NETs.  Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT. Serotonergic effects occur with lower doses, whereas both serotonergic and noradrenergic effects occur with higher doses of venlafaxine. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that the low dose of venlafaxine blocked selectively the reuptake of 5-HT, whereas the high dose blocked the reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. Moreover, an enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission by venlafaxine was only achieved under conditions whereby the desensitization of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptor is appended to that of the somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptor."
Can exosomes be detected in urine?,yes,"Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted into the extracellular environment upon internal vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. The molecular content of exosomes is a fingerprint of the releasing cell type and of its status. For this reason, and because they are released in easily accessible body fluids such as blood and urine, they represent a precious biomedical tool.  Exosomes are vesicles that are released from the kidney into urine. Quantification of human urinary exosomes by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are released by cells throughout the nephron and contain biomolecules from their cells of origin. Urinary exosomes have been proposed as potential diagnostic tools. Urinary exosomes as a source of kidney dysfunction biomarker in renal transplantation . Here we sought to optimize the methodologies for the isolation and quantification of urinary exosomal microRNA as a prelude to biomarker discovery studies.  Exosomes are small (30-150 nm) vesicles containing unique RNA and protein cargo, secreted by all cell types in culture. They are also found in abundance in body fluids including blood, saliva, and urine.  Urinary exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) are a heterogenous mixture (diameter 40-200 nm) containing vesicles shed from all segments of the nephron including glomerular podocytes Exosomes are cytoplasm containing vesicles released by many cells that can be found in several biological fluids including urine.

It is an autosomal recessive, developmental mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder characterized by deficiency in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) catalytic activity, refractory seizures, neurodegeneration, and liver disease Histopathological findings in both patients ((a) chronic hepatitis with prominent bile duct proliferation, fatty change, and fibrosis; (b) in the brain a patchy destruction of the cerebral cortex, predominantly involving striate cortex) were characteristic of progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood with liver disease--Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome--a rare autosomal recessive disorder usually seen in infants and young children Histopathological findings in both patients ((a) chronic hepatitis with prominent bile duct proliferation, fatty change, and fibrosis; (b) in the brain a patchy destruction of the cerebral cortex, predominantly involving striate cortex) were characteristic of progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood with liver disease--Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome--a rare autosomal recessive disorder usually seen in infants and young children. Alpers syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hepatocerebral degenerative disorder. Alpers disease is a recessive mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in POLG1 and characterized primarily by progressive neurological and hepatic degeneration. Alpers syndrome is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder that affects children and young adults. We conclude that Alpers disease can be a cause of rapidly progressive liver failure in early childhood. Although the cause of this autosomal recessive disease is not known, it does not appear to be related to peroxisomal dysfunction."
Is vemurafenib effective for hairy-cell leukemia?,yes,"CONCLUSIONS: A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia. Our results strongly support and inform the clinical use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in HCL. The therapeutic approach of vemurafenib in treatment-refractory hairy cell leukemia is promising and offers an additional treatment option.  Successful re-treatment of a relapsed V600E mutated HCL patient with low-dose vemurafenib. Recent identification of the recurrent V600E BRAF mutation in a majority of HCL patients has led some teams to evaluate the clinical potential of vemurafenib, a BRAF V600 specific inhibitor in a limited number of refractory HCL patients. Recently, we published the case of an HCL patient successfully treated with a low dose of vemurafenib. We present here the successful retreatment of this patient with a second line of vemurafenib. Our data suggest for the first time that vemurafenib at the dose of 240 mg once a day could be sufficient to maintain a complete hematological remission after an initial induction treatment with low-dose vemurafenib (2 × 240 mg) daily without inducing major toxicity. The discovery of the BRAF mutation has created a therapeutic target exploited by oral inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib. [Successful use of vemurafenib in a patient with resistant hairy cell leukemia]. The frequent persistence of phosphorylated ERK-positive leukemic cells in bone marrow at the end of treatment suggests bypass reactivation of MEK and ERK as a resistance mechanism.CONCLUSIONS: A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.  A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia. A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.

Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioma patients?,yes,"Mutations lead to TERT upregulation and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in glioblastomas. Kaplan-Meier's survival analysis showed that TERT promoter mutation (P=0.037), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation (P<0.001), and 1p/19q codeletion (P<0.001) were associated with favorable overall survival (OS). In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004). Consistent with this observation, in the subset of 97 IDH-mutated astrocytomas, 14 TERT promoter-mutated tumors showed longer PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). In contrast, among the subset of 74 IDH wild-type lower-grade gliomas with intact 1p/19q, TERT promoter mutation was associated with shorter PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). Similarly, in the subset of 65 IDH wild-type astrocytomas, 16 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited unfavorable PFS (P=0.007) and OS (P=0.008). Our results indicate that when combined with IDH status, TERT promoter mutation contributes to prognostic subgroups of lower-grade astrocytic tumors or 1p/19q intact lower-grade gliomas and this may further refine future molecular classification of lower-grade gliomas. RESULTS: TERTp-mut identified in 60.8% of gliomas (491 out of 807) was globally associated with poorer outcome (Hazard ratio (HR)=1.50).  TERT promoter mutations lead to high transcriptional activity under hypoxia and temozolomide treatment and predict poor prognosis in gliomas. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age. TERT promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and TMZ treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit TERT promoter mutations alone predominately have primary GBMs associated with poor median OS (11.5 months). Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit IDH1/2 mutations alone predominately have astrocytic morphologies and exhibit a median OS of 57 months while patients whose tumors exhibit both TERT promoter and IDH1/2 mutations predominately exhibit oligodendroglial morphologies and exhibit median OS of 125 months. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age.CONCLUSION: TERT promoter mutations were specific to gliomas.  We defined, based on TERTp-mut and IDH mutation status, four prognostic groups: (1) TERTp-mut and IDH-mut associated with 1p19q codeletion, overall survival (OS)>17 years; (2) TERTp-wt and IDH-mut, associated with TP53 mutation, OS=97.5 months; (3) TERTp-wt and IDH-wt, with no specific association, OS=31.6 months; (4) TERTp-mut and IDH-wt, associated with EGFR amplification, OS=15.4 months.  Mutations lead to TERT upregulation and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in glioblastomas.  In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004).  The mean age at diagnosis was lowest (37 years) among patients who had gliomas with only IDH mutations and was highest (59 years) among patients who had gliomas with only TERT mutations. The molecular groups were independently associated with overall survival among patients with grade II or III gliomas but not among patients with grade IV gliomas. Mutations were detected in gliomas, but not in meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, cavernomas, intracranial metastases, normal brain tissues, or peripheral blood of glioma patients. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age."
Is stop codon bypass possible?,yes,"In 1999, proof-of-concept for treating these disorders was obtained in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, when administration of aminoglycosides restored protein translation by inducing the ribosome to bypass a PTC. Aminoglycosides can bypass nonsense mutations and are the prototypic agents for translational bypass therapy (TBT). Expression of retroviral replication enzymes (Pol) requires a controlled translational recoding event to bypass the stop codon at the end of gag. This recoding event occurs either by direct suppression of termination via the insertion of an amino acid at the stop codon (readthrough) or by alteration of the mRNA reading frame (frameshift). Recent studies on translation termination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have not only enabled the identification of the key components of the termination machinery, but have also revealed several regulatory mechanisms that might enable the controlled synthesis of C-terminally extended polypeptides via stop-codon readthrough.  The effects of all possible single-base mutations in the codons flanking the stop indicated that 3' contexts of the form CAR-YYA confer leakiness and that the 3' context permits read through of UAA and UGA stop codons as well as UAG. As a first step to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which ribosomes bypass leaky stop codons in vivo, we have devised a system in which readthrough is coupled to the transient expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in tobacco protoplasts."

Isn't there an association between bruxism and reflux,no,"Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, no robust evidence supports the association between SB and GERD. Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. Our large-scale cross-sectional study found that problem behaviors in adolescents were associated with sleep problems, including sleep bruxism, as well as lifestyle and food habits and GERD symptoms. The frequencies of EMG bursts, rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes, grinding noise, and the RMMA/microarousal ratio were significantly higher in the 20-minute period after acidic infusion than after saline infusion. RMMA episodes including SB were induced by esophageal acidification.

Association between nocturnal bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux. Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing."
Can a peptide aptamer be used as protein inhibitor?,yes,"Peptide aptamers of LIM-only protein 2 (Lmo2) were previously used to successfully treat Lmo2-induced tumours in a mouse model of leukaemia. Inhibition of mammalian cell proliferation by genetically selected peptide aptamers that functionally antagonize E2F activity. Accumulating work over the past decade has shown that peptide aptamer screening represents a valid strategy for inhibitor identification that can be applied to a variety of different targets.  . The target of one inhibitor peptide, Pep80, identified in this screen was determined to be Snapin, a protein associated with the soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor adaptor protein receptor (SNARE) complex that is critical for calcium-dependent exocytosis during neurotransmission.  Use of the genetically selected intracellular aptamer inhibitors allowed us to define unique mechanisms important to HIV-1 replication and T cell biology. This review will describe pre-clinical and clinical data of four major classes of TGF-β inhibitor, namely i) ligand traps, ii) antisense oligonucleotides, iii) receptor kinase inhibitors and iv) peptide aptamers.   A peptide aptamer (ID1/3-PA7) has been designed to prevent this interaction and thereby leading to the transcription of p16(INK4a). A peptide kinase inhibitor (IP(20)) was used as the aptameric peptide  Peptide aptamer mimicking RAD51-binding domain of BRCA2 inhibits DNA damage repair and survival in Trypanosoma brucei.  peptide aptamer, Id1/3-PA7, targeting Id1 and Id3, Targeting Id1 and Id3 by a specific peptide aptamer induces E-box promoter activity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Aptamer-derived peptides as potent inhibitors of the oncogenic RhoGEF Tgat. Our approach thus demonstrates that peptide aptamers are potent inhibitors that can be used to interfere with RhoGEF functions in vivo. Development of systemic in vitro evolution and its application to generation of peptide-aptamer-based inhibitors of cathepsin E. he fusion peptide, TA aptamer, was observed within PC12 cytoplasm and maintained both Abeta-binding ability and antioxygenic property similar to TRX. Stable expression of a novel fusion peptide of thioredoxin-1 and ABAD-inhibiting peptide protects PC12 cells from intracellular amyloid-beta. In order to efficiently select aptamers that bind to and inhibit proteins, Aptamer selection based on inhibitory activity using an evolution-mimicking algorithm. This demonstrates the utility of this strategy for screening aptamers based on their inhibitory actions. Intracellular expression of the DRD-binding peptide aptamer specifically suppressed receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis but not intrinsic pathway, which was recapitulated by the antisense oligonucleotides for FLASH.  Peptide aptamers are peptides constrained and presented by a scaffold protein that are used to study protein function in cells. They are able to disrupt protein-protein interactions  Here we have used a genetic screen in yeast to select in vivo peptides coupled to thioredoxin, called aptamers, that could inhibit GEFD2 activity. One aptamer, TRIAPalpha (TRio Inhibitory APtamer), specifically blocks GEFD2-exchange activity on RhoA in vitro. These results show that cell proliferation can be inhibited using genetically-selected synthetic peptides that specifically target protein-protein interaction motifs within cell cycle regulators. These data highlight the utility of peptide aptamers to identify novel binding interfaces and highlight a role for MAP1B in DAPK-1-dependent signaling in autophagy and membrane blebbing."
Are integrins part of the extracellular matrix?,yes,"Several constituents of the ECM provide adhesive cues, which serve as binding sites for cell trans-membrane receptors, such as integrins. We also determined that blocking β1integrins, the major class of receptors for all ECM proteins tested, Here, we elucidate a cross-scale mechanism for tissue assembly and ECM remodeling involving Cadherin 2, the ECM protein Fibronectin, and its receptor Integrin α5.  due to the diverse functions and variable expression of proteoglycans, matrix proteins, and integrins, it is rather difficult to identify a comprehensive therapeutic target among ECM components. Integrin-dependent cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion is a determinant of spindle orientation. The extracellular matrix component periostin is a secreted protein that functions as both a cell attachment protein and an autocrine or paracrine factor that signals through the cell adhesion molecule integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5.  Integrin receptors connect the extracellular matrix to the cell cytoskeleton to provide essential forces and signals.   the integrin, talin, and actin filament form a linear complex of which both ends are typically anchored to the extracellular matrices via integrins. Integrins, a central family of cellular ECM receptors, have been implicated in these processes but their specific role in ES cell self-renewal remains unclear. Attachment to the extracellular matrix is mediated by a complex of adhesion proteins, including integrins, signaling molecules, actin and actin-binding proteins, and scaffolding proteins. Beta 1 integrin binding plays a role in the constant traction force generation in response to varying stiffness for cells grown on mature cardiac extracellular matrix."
Isn't Calcium homeostasis important in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology?,no,"Maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis is critical to regulating mitochondrial ATP production and cardiac contraction.  the Ca(2+) signal regulates the most important activities of the cell, from the expression of genes, to heart and muscle contraction and other motility processes, to diverse metabolic pathways involved in the generation of cell fuels Pharmacologic modification of cellular calcium handling recently moved into focus as an alternative for prevention and treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias diabetic rats displayed abnormal cardiac structure and systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and spermine (CaSR agonist) could prevent or slow its progression. These results indicate that the CaSR expression of myocardium is reduced in the progress of DCM, and its potential mechanism is related to the impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis. calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays important roles in cardiac electrical activity and calcium homeostasis. NCX current (I(NCX)) shows transmural gradient across left ventricle in many species. Previous studies demonstrated that NCX expression was increased and transmural gradient of I(NCX) was disrupted in failing heart calcium homeostasis, the key process underlying excitation-contraction coupling The results indicate the calcium handling properties of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are relatively immature to hESC counterparts Our understanding of the molecular processes which regulate cardiac function has grown immeasurably in recent years. Even with the advent of β-blockers, angiotensin inhibitors and calcium modulating agents, heart failure (HF) still remains a seriously debilitating and life-threatening condition. Here, we review the molecular changes which occur in the heart in response to increased load and the pathways which control cardiac hypertrophy, calcium homeostasis, and immune activation during HF. Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are G-protein coupled receptors which maintain systemic calcium homeostasis and participate in hormone secretion, activation of ion channels, cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. CaSRs are associated with I/R injury and apoptosis in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes via suppressing Bcl-2 and promoting caspase-3 expression. Important insights into the molecular basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and related diseases have been gained by studying families with inherited cardiac hypertrophy. Integrated clinical and genetic investigations have demonstrated that different genetic defects can give rise to the common phenotype of cardiac hypertrophy. Diverse pathways have been identified, implicating perturbations in force generation, force transmission, intracellular calcium homeostasis, myocardial energetics, and cardiac metabolism in causing disease HAX-1 as a regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. Thus, HAX-1 represents a regulatory mechanism in cardiac calcium cycling and its responses to sympathetic stimulation, implicating its importance in calcium homeostasis and cell survival. Calcium ions are the most ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Calcium homeostasis and signaling systems are crucial for both the normal growth of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the intricate working of the mammalian heart. this knowledge can be used to help treat relevant human diseases such as pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure With aging, the heart develops myocyte hypertrophy associated with impaired relaxation indices. To define the cellular basis of this adaptation, we examined the physiological changes that arise in calcium handling in the aging heart and contrasted the adaptations that occur following the imposition of a stimulus that alters calcium homeostasis in a young and an old heart alterations in the calcium-handling machinery of the cardiocyte differ in the context of age and as such may predispose the older heart to the development of a hypertrophic phenotype. The cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX1) is a key sarcolemmal protein for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the heart.  Thus exchanger overexpression in mice leads to abnormal calcium handling and a decompensatory transition to heart failure with stress Central to controlling intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) are a number of Ca(2+) transporters and channels with the L-type Ca(2+) channel, Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) being of particular note in the heart. This review concentrates on the regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) in cardiac muscle and the homeostatic mechanisms employed to ensure that the heart can operate under steady-state conditions on a beat by beat basis. the tight regulation of SR Ca(2+) content is also required to prevent the abnormal, spontaneous or diastolic release of Ca(2+) from the SR. Such diastolic events are a major factor contributing to the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias in disease situations and in recently identified familial mutations in the SR Ca(2+) release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR). Calcium channels have a unique functional role, because not only do they participate in this activity, they form the means by which electrical signals are converted to responses within the cell. Calcium channels play an integral role in excitation in the heart and shaping the cardiac action potential. In addition, calcium influx through calcium channels is responsible for initiating contraction. Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis underlie cardiac arrhythmia, contractile dysfunction and cardiac remodelling.  Cardiac calcium (Ca(2+)) handling subsumes the mechanisms maintaining the myocardial Ca(2+) homeostasis that contribute essentially to cardiac performance. Calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation and disorders in cardiac Ca(2+) homeostasis have great influence on the cardiac action potential. We review the physiology of the cardiac calcium homeostasis, including the cardiac excitation contraction coupling and myocyte calcium cycling. We review the physiology of the cardiac calcium homeostasis, including the cardiac excitation contraction coupling and myocyte calcium cycling Calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation and disorders in cardiac Ca(2+) homeostasis have great influence on the cardiac action potential The role of calcium in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle physiology was reviewed, highlighting the major mechanisms responsible for maintaining calcium homeostasis in these cells Energy metabolism and Ca(2+) handling serve critical roles in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology"
Couldn't DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases serve as tumour markers?,no,"Here, we report evidence of the overexpression of DNA methyltransferases 3B (DNMT3B) in invasive cervical cancer and of the inhibition of metastasis by DNMT3B interference. This study was designed to determine the significance of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in DNA hypermethylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to identify DNA methylation markers in serum for the early diagnosis of ESCC. DNA methyltransferase 1 as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy in gastric cancer. We examined the prognostic and predictive impact of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and 3b expression in gastric carcinomas (GC) treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. High DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was found in 105/127 (83%) and 79/127 (62%) carcinomas, respectively. Tumoral DNMT3b mRNA up-regulation was significantly correlated with hypermethylation of multiple tumor-related genes (P=0.021). A regulator of de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, DNMT3L promoter was found to have lost DNA methylation to varying levels in 14 out of 15 cancer cervix samples analysed. The present study highlights the importance of DNA methylation profile at DNMT3L promoter not only as a promising biomarker for cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, but also provides insight into the possible role of DNMT3L in cancer development. DNMT3L is a novel marker and is essential for the growth of human embryonal carcinoma. Among the DNMT genes, we found that mRNA for DNMT3L was specifically expressed in TGCTs, but neither in normal testicular tissues nor in cancer cells of somatic tissue origin. DNMT3L protein was strongly expressed in two EC cell lines, but not in the cell lines of somatic tissue origin. Positive nuclear labeling for DNMT3a was found only in few neoplasms: 1 pleomorphic adenoma (9.0%), 2 adenoid cystic carcinoma (16.6%) and 1 mucoepidermoid (9.0%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results were not able to demonstrate a clear correlation between DNMT1 and DNMT3a immunoexpression and salivary gland neoplasms development. DNA methylation, mediated by the combined action of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), is essential for mammalian development and is a major contributor to cellular transformation. The prevalence, the prognostic effect, and interaction with other molecular markers of DNMT3A mutations was studied in 415 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger than 60 years. The recent identification of DNMT3A mutations in de novo acute myeloid leukemia prompted us to determine their frequency, patterns and clinical impact in a cohort of 98 patients with either therapy-related or secondary acute myeloid leukemia developing from an antecedent hematologic disorder. DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were also decreased in vorinostat-treated A549 cancer cells. To identify the mechanisms responsible for these genome-wide DNA methylation alterations, we measured the gene expression levels of several DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and their interacting proteins by TaqMan qPCR and observed increased expression of DNMT3A2, DNMT3B, and EZH2 in tumors. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is the primary enzyme that maintains DNA methylation. 5-Azactydine inhibits cell growth by direct cytotoxic action as well as by inhibition of DNA methyl transferase enzyme. Alterations in metabolism of methyl donors, disturbances in activity and/or expression of DNA methyltransferases, and presence of DNA single-strand breaks could contribute to the loss of cytosine methylation during carcinogenesis; however, the precise mechanisms of genomic hypomethylation induced by chemical carcinogens remain largely unknown. Recently, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DNMT3B promoter region, C46359T (-149C>T), -283T>C, and -579G>T have also been reported to be stratification markers that can predict an individual's susceptibility to cancers. Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play important roles during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs. Thus, tumour subsets exist that display concurrent decreased BRCA1 expression, BRCA1 promoter methylation, cytoplasmic CTCF expression and with DNMT3b over-expression. DNA methylation patterns in genome are maintained during replication by a DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play an important role during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs. To investigate the relationship between the expression of DNMT and clinical prognosis in adult patients with acute leukemia (AL), the mRNA expressions of DNMT, p15(INK4B), mdr1 were measured in 72 AL patients and 20 normal controls by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the ratio of p15 CpG land methylation was measured in 56 AL patients and 14 normal controls by methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR). DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 ensures clonal transmission of lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns in a mammalian genome during replication. Overexpression of the major DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is cytotoxic and has been hypothesized to result in aberrant hypermethylation of genes required for cell survival. DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays an important role in the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns via complicated networks including signaling pathways and transcriptional factors, relating to cell differentiation or carcinogenesis. We evaluated the significance of aberrant DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein expression during gastric carcinogenesis."
Isn't phospholamban phosphorylated by Protein kinase A?,no,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation of PLB phosphorylation of PLN, at either Ser(16) by PKA  Activation of cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) by beta1-agonists involves cAMP- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), which relieves the inhibitory effects of PLB on SERCA2a.  Phospholamban (PLB) is a sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein that when phosphorylated at Ser16 by PKA phosphorylation of PLB by the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).  cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation at serine-16 Phospholamban (PLB) is a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade in the heart, functioning to modulate contractile force by altering the rate of calcium re-sequestration by the Ca-ATPase. Functionally, inhibition by PLB binding is manifested by shifts in the calcium dependence of Ca-ATPase activation toward higher calcium levels; phosphorylation of PLB by PKA reverses the inhibitory action of PLB. phosphorylation of both PLB residues (Ser16, PKA site, and Thr17, CaMKII site)  Phosphorylation of Ser(16) by PKA stabilization of the structure of PLB following phosphorylation of Ser(16) Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase, and this inhibition is relieved by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation.  Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of phosphorylated phospholamban indicated that cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates at a single site, A, and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates at sites C1 and C2 in the low molecular weight form, where A is different from C1 but may be the same as C2. Because SR function is regulated by phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), a SR protein phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at Ser(16)and Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) at Thr(17), the phosphorylation of these residues during ischemia and reperfusion was examined in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts These changes were associated with reduced protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) and protein kinase A phosphorylated phospholamban (PLB), which was reduced in HF, but essentially abolished in VD-HF The data indicate that 1) phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase is the main regulator of beta-adrenergic-induced cardiac relaxation definitely preceding Thr17 phosphorylation and 2) the beta-adrenergic-mediated phosphorylation of Thr17 by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase required influx of Ca2+ through the L-type Ca2+ channel Here we extend this model to explain the reversal of SERCA2a inhibition that occurs after phosphorylation of PLB at Ser(16) by protein kinase A (PKA) and after binding of the anti-PLB monoclonal antibody 2D12, which recognizes residues 7-13 of PLB Phospholamban is phosphorylated in heart by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CM-kinase-II) and in smooth muscle cells by cGMP-dependent protein kinase Phospholamban, the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum proteolipid, is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, by Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, and by an endogenous Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, the identity of which remains to be defined"
Are there telemedicine applications for chronic pain management?,yes,"An integrated cognitive-behavioral and physical therapy group protocol has been developed and then implemented at remote sites using videoconferencing technology to provide pain management for veterans.

Doesn't molindone affect body weight?,no,"Mean weight increased by 0.54 kg, and mean body mass index by 0.24 kg/m(2).  A large-scale trial comparing a first-generation antipsychotic (molindone) with newer agents did not find significant differences in treatment response, although the newer antipsychotics were associated with more severe weight gain.  No agent demonstrated superior efficacy, and all were associated with side effects, including weight gain.  The three treatment arms did not significantly differ in symptom decrease or time to discontinuation. Akathisia was more common with molindone and elevated prolactin concentrations more common with risperidone. Although weight gain and metabolic adverse events had occurred more often with olanzapine and risperidone during the acute trial, no significant between-drug differences emerged in most of these parameters during maintenance treatment.  Olanzapine and risperidone were associated with significantly greater weight gain. Olanzapine showed the greatest risk of weight gain and significant increases in fasting cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, insulin, and liver transaminase levels. Molindone led to more self-reports of akathisia.  Molindone is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but it does cause significantly more weight loss (2RCTs n=60 RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77).  Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic but its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics (apart from the event of weight loss).  Convergent evidence suggests a hierarchy in the magnitude of BWG that may be induced by diverse agents, being very high for clozapine and olanzapine; high for quetiapine, zotepin, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine; moderate for risperidone and sertindole; and low for ziprazidone, amisulpiride, haloperidol, fluphenazine, pimozide, and molindone.  Loxapine and molindone induce weight decreases, and these exceptions are difficult to explain. It is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but causes significantly more weight loss (RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99). Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic; however, its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics, apart from the event of weight loss.  Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a reduction of 0.39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3.19 kg with thioridazine. Weight gain has been reported with nearly every antipsychotic drug on the market (molindone is an exception).  Although almost all antipsychotics induce bodyweight gain, molindone and loxapine appear to induce bodyweight loss.  Clozapine and low-potency phenothiazines are associated with the largest gains and molindone with weight loss, but the mechanism is not known.  On average, molindone patients lost 5 pounds over the 6 weeks of treatment, whereas thioridazine patients gained 6 pounds.  Clinically, molindone has a tendency to cause weight loss and may have less effect on seizure threshold than conventional antipsychotic agents  Monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone, a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics, or other neuroleptic drugs. We found no significant differences in weight gain among the three groups.  The weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients. There was an average weight loss of 7.6 kg after 3 months on molindone; most of the loss occurred during the first month."
Is the SDHAF2 gene  encoding a protein necessary for flavination of SDHA?,yes,"the gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the flavination of SDHA (SDHAF2 or hSDH5) SDHAF2, required for flavination of SDHA Pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome is caused by mutations in SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, encoding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and in SDHAF2, required for flavination of SDHA.  At present, these are RET proto-oncogene, von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene (VHL), neurofibromatosis type 1 tumor suppressor gene (NF1), genes encoding the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex subunits SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, but also SDHA, the gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the flavination of SDHA (SDHAF2 or hSDH5), and the newly described TMEM127 and MAX tumor suppressor genes. Pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome is caused by mutations in SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, encoding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and in SDHAF2, required for flavination of SDHA. In a recent issue of Science, Rutter and coworkers showed that SDH5 is required for the flavination of SDHA, which is necessary for SDH assembly and function.

Could Arimidex (anastrozole) cause hot flashes?,yes,"More than a third of breast cancer patients undergoing aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment report joint pain. In the first 6 weeks, emergence of joint pain was associated with increase in general pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and decreased sexual activity. Antiestrogen therapy can cause vasomotor symptoms similar to those occurring during menopause, including hot flashes. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of acupuncture for treatment of hot flashes in Korean patients with breast cancer receiving antiestrogen therapy. 10 patients with breast cancer who were undergoing antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or anastrozole and who were suffering from hot flashes. During treatment, severity of hot flashes was reduced by 70%-95% in all patients. anastrozole has been widely used in Japan as an adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal, hormone-responsive breast cancer patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the rate of bone fracture and bone mineral density (BMD) during anastrozole treatment in Japanese patients. Musculoskeletal disorders were the most common (26.1 %), and hot flashes were the second most common adverse event (7.9 %). To compare the effect of therapy with anastrozole versus a combination of fulvestrant and anastrozole in women in first relapse of endocrine-responsive breast cancer. fulvestrant loading dose (LD) regimen followed by monthly injection plus 1 mg of anastrozole daily or to 1 mg of anastrozole daily alone. Incidences of prespecified adverse events (AEs) were similar. Hot flashes were more common in the experimental arm: 63 patients (24.6%) versus 35 patients (13.8%) in the standard arm (P = .0023). The third-generation agents (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) have been shown to be more effective and safer than the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifen. AIs are well tolerated and cause a lower incidence of gynecological symptoms (vaginal bleeding, discharge, and endometrial neoplasia), venous thromboembolic events, and hot flashes compared with tamoxifen. Mood disturbances, somnolence, anxiety, fatigue, hot flashes, and memory impairment have been reported among patients receiving anastrozole as adjuvant therapy. Twenty-five PM-BC patients received, in sequence, leuprorelin, taxane-anthracycline induction chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a platinum-based intensification high-dose CT, followed by leuprorelin and anastrazole for five years. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was observed in all patients, no patient showed a decrease of cardiac ejection fraction and hot flashes and arthralgias were of moderate intensity. Of the patients treated with anastrozole, 3 (37.5%) reported toxicity, with 1 report each of decreased libido, leg swelling, and depression (12.5%). Toxicity was reported in 2 patients taking letrozole (40%), with both reporting peripheral edema, and 1 reporting hot flashes. Patients were treated with goserelin 3.6 mg subcutaneous monthly and began anastrozole 1-mg daily 21 days after the first injection of goserelin. The most common adverse events were fatigue (50%), arthralgias (53%), and hot flashes (59%). These studies were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AIs in the following clinical settings: 1) as initial adjuvant therapy (the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial, Breast International Group Trial 1-98), AIs were tolerated well, and patients who received them experienced fewer thrombolic events and less endometrial cancer, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal bleeding compared with patients who receive tamoxifen. It has been suggested that the association of AI and GnRh analogues and AI could block the two routes of oestrogen production in males, and therefore this approach could increase efficacy. However, it could also enhance the rate of adverse events (hot flashes, sexual impotence, etc.). We reviewed therapeutic effects and harmful side effects in 33 patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer who underwent treatment with Anastrozole 1 mg/day in our department. The most frequent harmful side effects were rise in total cholesterol, general fatigue, hot flashes and arthralgia (9.1%). We analyzed the changes in frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms in patients receiving tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors and identified factors influencing these symptoms. Both first-line tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors induced an increase in the occurrence and severity of hot flashes (p<0.0001 and p=0.014, respectively). To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the selective aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex), we conducted a phase II trial in 53 women with asymptomatic recurrent/persistent müllerian cancer. Toxicity was modest (grade I) and infrequent, with the most common toxicities being fatigue and hot flashes. The first analysis of the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial (median follow-up, 33 months) demonstrated that in adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer, anastrozole was superior to tamoxifen in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), time to recurrence (TTR), and incidence of contralateral breast cancer (CLBC). in that endometrial cancer (P = 0.007), vaginal bleeding and discharge (P < 0.001 for both), cerebrovascular events (P < 0.001), venous thromboembolic events (P < 0.001), and hot flashes (P < 0.001) all occurred less frequently in the anastrozole group, whereas musculoskeletal disorders and fractures (P < 0.001 for both) continued to occur less frequently in the tamoxifen group. reduced nausea, hot flashes, and abdominal discomfort caused almost twice as many patients to prefer to continue with letrozole therapy than with anastrozole"
Are there any urine biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis?,yes,"CONCLUSIONS: Several gene-based urinary biomarkers have demonstrated promise in initial studies, which now need to be rigorously validated in the clinical setting for them to be translated into clinically useful tests in diagnosis, surveillance or risk-stratification of bladder cancer  Novel promising markers are in various stages of clinical testing, and a panel of biomarkers may serve in the future as a feasible alternative to urine cytology and cystoscopy for the screening, detection, and follow-up of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. RESULTS: Seven of the 8 urine biomarkers were increased in subjects with bladder cancer relative to those without bladder cancer. The 7 biomarkers were assessed in a new model, which had an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.93), and 74% sensitivity and 90% specificity. The study provides further evidence that the reported panel of diagnostic biomarkers can reliably achieve the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer with higher sensitivity than currently available urine based assays. The urinary concentrations of 14 biomarkers (IL-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, SDC1, CCL18, PAI-1, CD44, VEGF, ANG, CA9, A1AT, OPN, PTX3, and APOE) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Diagnostic performance of each biomarker and multivariate models were compared using receiver operating characteristic curves and the chi-square test. An 8-biomarker model achieved the most accurate BCa diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 97%), but a combination of 3 of the 8 biomarkers (IL-8, VEGF, and APOE) was also highly accurate (sensitivity 90%, specificity 97%). For comparison, the commercial BTA-Trak ELISA test achieved a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 83%, and voided urine cytology detected only 33% of BCa cases in the same cohort. These data show that a multivariate urine-based assay can markedly improve the accuracy of non-invasive BCa detection : Histopathological grading of papillary urothelial tumors (PUTs) of the urinary bladder is subjective and poorly reproducible. We investigated the relationship between the expression of frequently deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as their target genes (ZEB1/ZEB2) and bladder cancer histopathological grade in an attempt to find a miRNA that might allow more reliable grading of PUTs. The Mcm5 immunoassay is a non-invasive test for identifying patients with urothelial cancers with similar accuracy to the FDA-approved NMP22 ELISA Test Kit. The combination of Mcm5 plus NMP22 improves the detection of UCC and identifies 95% of clinically significant disease. Trials of a commercially developed Mcm5 assay suitable for an end-user laboratory alongside NMP22 are required to assess their potential clinical utility in improving diagnostic and surveillance care pathways. HYAL-1 and HAS1 expression predicted BCa metastasis, and HYAL-1 expression also predicted disease-specific survival. Furthermore, the combined HAS2-HYAL-1 biomarker detected BCa and significantly predicted its recurrence. Cancer biomarkers are the backbone for the implementation of individualized approaches to bladder cancer (BCa).  Through genomic and proteomic profiling of urine, we have identified a panel of biomarkers associated with the presence of BCa. In this study, we evaluated the utility of three of these biomarkers, interleukin 8 (IL-8), Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and Syndecan in the diagnosis of BCa through urinalysis. METHODS: Voided urines from 127 subjects, cancer subjects (n = 64), non-cancer subjects (n = 63) were analyzed. The protein concentrations of IL-8, MMP-9, and Syndecan were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). . There was an association between differences in individual biomarkers and differences in protein levels over time, particularly in control patients. Collectively, our findings identify caveats intrinsic to the common practice of protein standardization in biomarker discovery studies conducted on urine, particularly in patients with hematuria"
Is Ctf4 involved in sister chromatid cohesion establishment?,yes,"In addition to Eco1, several other factors contribute to cohesion establishment, including Ctf4, Ctf18, Tof1, Csm3, Chl1 and Mrc1, but little is known about their roles. Here, we show that each of these factors facilitates cohesin acetylation. Moreover, the absence of Ctf4 and Chl1, but not of the other factors, causes a synthetic growth defect in cells lacking Eco1. Distinct from acetylation defects, sister chromatid cohesion in ctf4Δ and chl1Δ cells is not improved by removing Wapl Thus, Ctf4 and Chl1 delineate an additional acetylation-independent pathway that might hold important clues as to the mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 Influence of the human cohesion establishment factor Ctf4/AND-1  Here, we used Xenopus egg extracts to show that AND-1 and Tim1-Tipin, homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ctf4 and Tof1-Csm3, respectively, are associated with the replisome and are required for proper establishment of the cohesion observed in the M-phase extracts These data defined two cohesion pathways, one containing CSM3, TOF1, CTF4, and CHL1, and the second containing MRC1, CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks WSS1 was also found to interact genetically with SGS1, TOP3, SRS2 and CTF4, which are involved in recombination, repair of replication forks and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion The catalytic subunit of budding yeast Polalpha (Pol1p) has been shown to associate in vitro with the Spt16p-Pob3p complex, a component of the nucleosome reorganization system required for both replication and transcription, and with a sister chromatid cohesion factor, Ctf4p Constituents of the replication fork, such as the DNA polymerase alpha-binding protein Ctf4, contribute to cohesion in ways that are poorly understood Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 and the pathway involving the acetylation of Smc3. Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Ctf4/AND-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both DNA replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. We show here that CTF8, CTF4 and a helicase encoded by CHL1 are required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells, and provide evidence that Chl1 functions during S-phase. In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Thus, Ctf4 and Chl1 delineate an additional acetylation-independent pathway that might hold important clues as to the mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment.

Can FOXOs modulate longevity?,yes,"Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have a conserved function in regulating metazoan lifespan. In contrast to FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO6 were specifically diminished in the CNS of HFD animals possibly contributing to the reduced lifespan observed in these animals. Interestingly, many target proteins of AMPK are so-called longevity factors, e.g., SIRT1, p53, and FoxOs, which not only can increase the stress resistance and extend the lifespan of many organisms but also inhibit the inflammatory responses.  Components of anti-ageing and autophagy include SirTs and FoxOs. Since Sirts and FoxOs are reliable markers of longevity, the results appear to suggest that Longevinex induces longevity after prolonged feeding via induction of autophagy, while it converts death signals into survival signals and provides cardioprotection within a relatively shorter period of time. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, stress resistance, metabolism, and longevity In this respect, members of the mammalian forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FoxOs) that include FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6 are increasingly being recognized as exciting prospects for multiple disorders. These transcription factors govern development, proliferation, survival and longevity during multiple cellular environments that can involve oxidative stress.  Here we discuss the fascinating but complex role of FoxOs during cellular injury and oxidative stress, progenitor cell development, fertility, angiogenesis, cardiovascular function, cellular metabolism and diabetes, cell longevity, immune surveillance and cancer. Many longevity genes, e.g. FoxOs and SIRT1, are inhibitors of NF-kappaB signaling.  Interestingly, several longevity genes such as SIRT1, SIRT6, and FoxOs can clearly suppress NF-kappaB signaling and in this way delay the aging process and extend lifespan. Yet, FoxOs also can significantly affect normal cell survival and longevity, requiring new treatments for neoplastic growth to modulate novel pathways that integrate cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and survival. These observations link FoxO function in mammalian systems with the evolutionarily conserved role of FoxO in promotion of stress resistance and longevity in lower phylogenetic systems. Furthermore, these findings have implications for aging in higher organisms and in malignant stem cell biology, and suggest that FoxOs may play an important role in the maintenance and integrity of stem cell compartments in a broad spectrum of tissues. Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are important downstream targets of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and crucial regulators of cell fate. This function of FoxOs relies on their ability to control diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA repair, defense against oxidative stress and ageing. This brief review focuses on the molecular mechanisms, cellular effects and resulting organismal phenotypes generated by differentially regulated FoxO proteins and discusses our current understanding of the role of FoxOs in disease and ageing processes. In this review, we focus on the several interactions of aging-associated signaling cascades regulated either by Sirtuins and FoxOs or NF-kappaB signaling pathways. We provide evidence that signaling via the longevity factors of FoxOs and SIRT1 can inhibit NF-kappaB signaling and simultaneously protect against inflamm-aging process. In diverse species transcription factors belonging to the forkhead/winged helix box gene, group O (FOXO) subfamily have been found to be crucial in downstream suppression of the life-shortening effects of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signalling pathways that, when upregulated, accelerate ageing by suppression of FOXO.  In humans, FOXO3a, as well as FOXO1 and -4, and their downstream effectors, could hold the key to counteracting ageing and common diseases. FOXO transcription factors have important roles in metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance, and aging."

This brief review focuses on the molecular mechanisms, cellular effects and resulting organismal phenotypes generated by differentially regulated FoxO proteins and discusses our current understanding of the role of FoxOs in disease and ageing processes. In this review, we focus on the several interactions of aging-associated signaling cascades regulated either by Sirtuins and FoxOs or NF-kappaB signaling pathways. We provide evidence that signaling via the longevity factors of FoxOs and SIRT1 can inhibit NF-kappaB signaling and simultaneously protect against inflamm-aging process. In diverse species transcription factors belonging to the forkhead/winged helix box gene, group O (FOXO) subfamily have been found to be crucial in downstream suppression of the life-shortening effects of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signalling pathways that, when upregulated, accelerate ageing by suppression of FOXO.  In humans, FOXO3a, as well as FOXO1 and -4, and their downstream effectors, could hold the key to counteracting ageing and common diseases. FOXO transcription factors have important roles in metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance, and aging."
Are CD44 variants (CD44v) associated with poor prognosis of metastasis?,yes,"CD44 variants and prognosis The CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms have been noted as markers for tumour metastasis and prognosis in several adenocarcinomas. Positive CD44v3 expression was associated with more advanced pathological stage and poorer prognosis than negative CD44v3 expression CD44v6 expression in the adenocarcinoma component may directly affect the behavior of carcinoma and the prognosis of patients D44 variant 6 in endometrioid carcinoma of the uterus: its expression in the adenocarcinoma component is an independent prognostic marker CD44v5 expression is independently positively correlated with the aggressiveness of thymic epithelial tumors. The expression of CD44v5 may be a potential trigger of tumor invasion in thymomas analysis of CD44v expression provides indications of biological and clinical relevance also in low grade lymphoproliferative disorders clinical relevance of CD44 variant isoform expression on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia CD44 variants and its association with survival in pancreatic cancer CD44 variant 6(v6) molecule has been noted as a marker for tumor metastasis and prognosis in several tumors CD44v2 and CD44v6 may be useful markers for poor prognosis in curatively resected primary pancreatic cancer CD44v8-10 may play an important role in the adhesion of tumor cells to the capillaries of distant organs in the metastatic process, and that immunohistochemical detection of CD44v8-10 may be a biologic marker of prognostic significance. combined expression of CD44v8-10 and SLX may be a biologic marker of prognostic significance variant isoforms (CD44v) are expressed on different malignant cells and tissues. Their upregulation has been implicated, in the progression and metastasis of malignomas. expression of the CD44 variant exon 6 is associated with lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer a number of variant forms of CD44 are frequently expressed, although these variants are infrequently expressed in normal lung tissue, and that the expression of CD44v6 is particularly associated with lymph node metastasis in NSCLC Expression of CD44v6 may suggest an increased risk for local lymph node metastasis in NSCLCs different CD44 isoforms are found in human skin cancers and are modulated during carcinogenesis D44 isoforms correlate with cellular differentiation but not with prognosis in human breast cancer Correlations between prognosis and expression of CD44v have been reported for gastric and colon carcinoma, for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and recently for breast carcinoma Certain splice variants (CD44v) can promote the metastatic behaviour of cancer cells.

Isn't Bladder training an effective method to treat urge incontinence ?,no,"Mindfulness-based stress reduction appears to be a treatment worthy of further study, as in the short term, it is as effective as historical studies of drug treatment and bladder training in reducing urge incontinence and incontinence-related quality of life. All patients, irrespective of the results of cystometry were subsequently treated with oxybutynin 2.5 mg twice daily along with bladder training. Of the 29 patients with stable bladder and symptoms of OAB, 100% cure rate was achieved in 20 (68.9%) and 06 (20.6%) patients respectively. While in 3 patients in both groups, decrease of symptoms upto 75% after 6 months of treatment was observed. Both urodynamically proven unstable and stable bladder showed nearly equal improvement with treatment There are 3 types of urine incontinence (urge-, stress-, and overflow-incontinence). Another standardization of urinary incontinence follows dysfunctions of the pelvic floor: detrusor muscle-dependent, due to sphincter spasm, prostate gland dependent. Urge incontinence with a dysfunction of the detrusor muscle is the most common type. Mixed types are frequent. Non-drug measures (e.g. pelvic muscle training, bladder training, toilet training are first choice treatments. Treatment of stress, urge and mixed incontinence can usually be commenced in primary care; pelvic floor exercises and bladder training are preferred. If bladder training is not effective for urge incontinence, anticholinergic drugs should be considered. Sixty patients (age 8 to 12 years) with urge incontinence or dysfunctional voiding were evaluated. After a no-treatment control period (average 6 months), patients underwent a 6-day bladder training course Six months after training completion, 64.1% and 64.7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with daytime wetting and 51.5% and 17.7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with nighttime wetting were cured or had improved Of the inpatient group with urge incontinence, the functional bladder capacity increased by 15%. To compare the efficacy of tolterodine plus simplified bladder training (BT) with tolterodine alone in patients with an overactive bladder. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is an effective and well tolerated treatment for an overactive bladder, the effectiveness of which can be augmented by a simplified BT regimen. Bladder training is a modification of bladder drill that is conducted more gradually on an outpatient basis and has resulted in significant reduction of incontinence in older, community-dwelling women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effect of treatment of female incontinence by the general practitioner (pelvic floor exercises, and bladder training) in female urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence and urge incontinence were treated by means of pelvic floor exercises and bladder training respectively, while a mixed incontinence was treated by bladder training followed by pelvic floor exercises. T The treatment consisted of training of pelvic muscles in stress incontinence and bladder training in urge incontinence RESULTS: After 3 months the mean frequency of urine loss per week diminished from 21 to 8, and after 12 months to 6 times. Some elders suffering from urge incontinence prefer pelvic muscle exercises to bladder training as the behavioral intervention of choice for eight out of nine women their continence had improved, both subjectively and objectively. Bladder training is a simple, safe, and effective treatment in the management of mild to moderate forms of urinary incontinence in outpatient populations. It can be used as a first-line treatment or in combination with such other interventions as pelvic muscle exercises, bladder pressure biofeedback, electrical stimulation, and drug therapy Treatment consisted of pelvic floor exercises in the case of stress incontinence and bladder training in the case of urge incontinence. After 3 months about 60% of the patients were either dry or only mildly incontinent terodiline group shows this drug to be a valuable adjunct to a bladder regimen in children with urge incontinence Basing on our experience with 39 patients with severe urge incontinence (in one-quarter of the cases pure urge incontinence, in one-half of the cases mixed incontinence and in a further quarter of the cases neurogenic bladder disorders) a supervised programme (mictiogram) and a well-tried therapy (especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries) consisting of the triad hospitalisation/bladder training/medication therapy are presented. After an average hospitalisation period of 14 days, we were able to achieve a symptom-free state in 94% of the patients. Anamnestic and urodynamical results are evaluated before and after bladder retraining drill (BRD) in women suffering from urge incontinence. We could state that the BRD is a good possibility to realize multistep-therapy of female incontinence. Twenty consecutive female patients with urge incontinence and stable detrusor function on provocative rapid fill CO2-cystometry were treated as out-patients with a bladder training programme and with terodiline/placebo in a double-blind cross-over design. In conclusion, female patients with idiopathic urge incontinence and stable detrusor function did respond to treatment as do female patients with urge incontinence and proven instability. The results of in-patient bladder training in 65 women with frequency, urgency and urge incontinence are reported. There was a good initial response in 88%. By 6 months the response rate had fallen to 38%. Patients with sensory urgency appeared to do better than those with detrusor instability and it is suggested that bladder training may be indicated as primary treatment in sensory urgency. Bladder training and/or biofeedback techniques were used to treat 75 patients with frequency, urgency, nocturia and urge incontinence. Significant improvement or cure was obtained in 70 per cent of enuretic children, and 66 per cent of men and 74 per cent of women with unstable detrusor function."
Do proton pump inhibitors affect thyroxine absorption?,yes,"Proton-pump inhibitors, antacids and a long list of drugs may decrease thyroxine absorption Many commonly used drugs, such as bile acid sequestrants, ferrous sulphate, sucralfate, calcium carbonate, aluminium-containing antacids, phosphate binders, raloxifene and proton-pump inhibitors, have also been shown to interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine.

Is PER3 required for CHK2 activation in human cells?,yes,"Per3, a circadian gene, is required for Chk2 activation in human cells. Depletion of Per3 by siRNA almost completely abolished activation of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) after inducing DNA damage in human cells. Per3 overexpression induced Chk2 activation in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, Per3 overexpression also led to the inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death.

Is the optogenetics tool ChR2 light-sensitive?,yes,"Channelrhodospin-2 (ChR2), a light-sensitive ion channel, and its variants have emerged as new excitatory optogenetic tools not only in neuroscience, but also in other areas, including cardiac electrophysiology. Light-sensitive genes chiefly including the genetically targeted light-gated channels channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR) cause intracellular ion flow during optical illumination.

Is autism one of the characteristics of Moebius syndrome?,yes,"The diagnosis of Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder, is primarily based on congenital facial and abducent nerve palsy. Involvement of other cranial nerves is also common. Occasionally the V, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves are involved, resulting in a difficulty to chew, swallow, and cough, which often leads to respiratory complications. Mental retardation and autism have been reported in some cases Moebius sequence is a rare congenital disorder usually defined as a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. A strong association of Moebius sequence with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been suggested in earlier studies with heterogenous age groups Certain genetic syndromes are providing us with extremely valuable information about the role played by genetics in autism. This is the case of the following syndromes: Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, 15q11-q13 duplication, fragile X syndrome, fragile X premutation, deletion of chromosome 2q, XYY syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Apert syndrome, mutations in the ARX gene, De Lange syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome, Williams syndrome, Rett syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Down syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Steinert disease, tuberous sclerosis, Duchenne's disease, Timothy syndrome, 10p terminal deletion, Cowden syndrome, 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, Myhre syndrome, Sotos syndrome, Cohen syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Lujan-Fryns syndrome, Moebius syndrome, hypomelanosis of Ito, neurofibromatosis type 1, CHARGE syndrome and HEADD syndrome.

Isn't Sarcolipin a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Calcium ATPase SERCA?,no,"The activity of SERCA is regulated by two small, homologous membrane proteins called phospholamban (PLB, also known as PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Detailed structural information explaining this regulatory mechanism has been lacking, and the structural features defining the pathway through which cytoplasmic Ca(2+) enters the intramembranous binding sites of SERCA have remained unknown. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) pump activity is modulated by phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Recent data suggest that SLN could play a role in muscle thermogenesis by promoting uncoupling of the SERCA pump Here we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) pump, is necessary for muscle-based thermogenesis. Sarcolipin (SLN) is a 3 kD membrane protein found in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It has 31 amino acid residues; SLN and phopholamban (PLB) are belong to the same protein family, so they have similar physiological functions. SLN inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) activity and reduces its affinity of Ca(2+), resulting in dysfunction of myocardial contraction and heart failure. Sarcolipin (SLN) is a key regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium. Together, these findings indicate that ablation of SLN results in increased SERCA activity and SR Ca(2+) load, which, in turn, could cause abnormal intracellular Ca(2+) handling and atrial remodeling. Sarcolipin (SLN) inhibits sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) pumps. These results show that 1) SLN regulates Ca(2+)-ATPase activity thereby regulating contractile kinetics in at least some skeletal muscles, 2) the functional significance of SLN is graded to the endogenous SLN expression level, and 3) SLN inhibitory effects on SERCA function are relieved in response to repeated contractions thus enhancing relaxation rates. The SERCA pump was constitutively activated in both atrial and ventricular chambers of the mouse heart by ablating its key regulators, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). The double-knockout (dKO) mice for PLN and SLN showed increased SERCA pump activity, Ca(2+) transients and SR Ca(2+) load, and developed cardiac hypertrophy. Our findings also emphasize the need for dynamic regulation of the SERCA pump by PLN and/or SLN to maintain cardiac contractility in normal conditions and during pathophysiological states. Sarcolipin (SLN) has emerged as an important regulator of the atrial sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ transport. The inhibitory effect of SLN on cardiac SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump can be relieved by beta-adrenergic stimulation, which indicates that SLN is a reversible inhibitor.  Sarcolipin is a novel regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and is expressed abundantly in atria. Our study documented that sarcolipin is a key regulator of SERCA2a in atria. Importantly, our data demonstrate the existence of distinct modulators for the SERCA pump in the atria and ventricles. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane protein that catalyzes the ATP-dependent transport of Ca(2+) from the cytosol to the SR. The activity of SERCA is inhibited by phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), and all these proteins participate in maintaining the normal intracellular calcium handling.  Sarcolipin (SLN) is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it inhibits SERCA (calcium ATPase) by lowering its apparent Ca2+ affinity in a manner similar to that of its homologue phospholamban (PLN). Remarkably, each domain of SLN behaves in a manner similar to that of the corresponding domains in PLN, supporting the hypothesis that both SLN and PLN bind SERCA in the same groove and with similar mechanisms. The role of sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac physiology was critically evaluated by generating a transgenic (TG) mouse model in which the SLN to sarco(endoplasmic)reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) ratio was increased in the ventricle. Overexpression of SLN decreases SR calcium transport function and results in decreased calcium transient amplitude and rate of relaxation. SLN TG hearts exhibit a significant decrease in rates of contraction and relaxation when assessed by ex vivo work-performing heart preparations. We conclude that SLN is a novel regulator of SERCA pump activity, and its inhibitory effect can be reversed by beta-adrenergic agonists. Sarcolipin, a homologue of phospholamban, regulates Ca2+ uptake through the interaction with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and is predominantly expressed in the atrial muscle. Sarcolipin (SLN) and phospholamban (PLN) are effective inhibitors of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA).  These results show that NF-SLN expression impairs muscle contractile function by inhibiting SERCA function and diminishing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. Sarcolipin (SLN) is an inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs) in vitro, but its function in vivo has not been defined. NF-SLN cDNA (SLN tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope) was introduced into rat soleus muscle in one hindlimb by plasmid injection and electrotransfer. Sarcolipin (SLN), a regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase of fast-twitch skeletal muscle (SERCA1a), is also expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles where phospholamban (PLN) and SERCA2a are expressed. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by sarcolipin is encoded in its luminal tail. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) are two single-pass membrane proteins that regulate Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), an ATP-driven pump that translocates calcium ions into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating muscle relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) [Research progress of sarcolipin-a new regulatory protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase].

Can't mutations in Calmodulin cause ventricular fibrillation?,no,"We characterized a family presenting with a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden death without ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities at rest. Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years, and another two were resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with documented VF at age 10 and 16, respectively. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue (p.Phe90Leu) in the CALM1 gene encoding calmodulin. This mutation was also carried by one of the sibs who died suddenly, for whom DNA was available. The mutation was present in the mother and in an sibling, both asymptomatic but displaying a marginally prolonged QT-interval during exercise. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a mutation in CALM1 underlying IVF manifesting in childhood and adolescence. The causality of the mutation is supported by previous studies demonstrating that Phe90 mediates the direct interaction of CaM with target peptides Here we show that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein, binds to the carboxy-terminal 'IQ' domain of the human cardiac Na channel (hH1) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This binding interaction significantly enhances slow inactivation-a channel-gating process linked to life-threatening idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. Mutations targeted to the IQ domain disrupted CaM binding and eliminated Ca2+/CaM-dependent slow inactivation, whereas the gating effects of Ca2+/CaM were restored by intracellular application of a peptide modelled after the IQ domain."

Is PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in the nervous system?,yes,"Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay Inhibitors of PLK kinases inhibited alpha-synuclein phosphorylation both in primary cortical cell cultures and in mouse brain in vivo specific knockdown of PLK2 expression by transduction with short hairpin RNA constructs or by knock-out of the plk2 gene reduced p-Ser-129 levels These results indicate that PLK2 plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in central nervous system. These results indicate that PLK2 plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in central nervous system. Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons. Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system. PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay. Two of these kinases stand out as potential drug targets for novel PD therapy, namely leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and the alpha-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylating polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2). Also, due to the dominant mode of α-syn and LRRK2 inheritance and based on current knowledge of LRRK2 and α-syn phosphorylation by PLK2, inhibition of LRRK2 and PLK2 may constitute a potential therapy for PD. To better understand the role of PLK2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo, we further evaluated the effect of PLK2 genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on Phospho-α-Syn levels in different brain regions of PLK2 knockout (KO), heterozygous (Het) and wild-type (WT) mice. This PLK2-mediated neuroprotective effect is also dependent on PLK2 activity and α-synuclein phosphorylation. PLK2-mediated degradation of α-synuclein requires both phosphorylation at S129 and PLK2/α-synuclein complex formation. Overexpression of only PLK2 increased phosphorylation of aggregated α-syn at S129, which likely is due to increased phosphorylation of soluble α-syn, which then was incorporated into aggregates. Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons. PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay. Unlike other kinases reported to partially phosphorylate alpha-syn at Ser-129 in vitro, phosphorylation by PLK2 and PLK3 is quantitative ( Inhibitors of PLK kinases inhibited alpha-synuclein phosphorylation both in primary cortical cell cultures and in mouse brain in vivo. These results indicate that PLK2 plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in central nervous system Inhibitors of PLK kinases inhibited alpha-synuclein phosphorylation both in primary cortical cell cultures and in mouse brain in vivo PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay To better understand the role of PLK2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo, we further evaluated the effect of PLK2 genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on Phospho-α-Syn levels in different brain regions of PLK2 knockout (KO), heterozygous (Het) and wild-type (WT) mice Polo-like kinase-2 (Plk-2) has been implicated as the dominant kinase involved in the phosphorylation of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies, which are one of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease neuropathology"
Can't PLN mutations lead to dilated cardiomyopathy?,no,"A PLN founder mutation (43 cases) and LMNA mutations (19 cases, 16 different mutations) were most prevalent and often demonstrated a specific phenotype. PLN mutation R14del was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients The PLN R14del founder mutation is present in a substantial number of patients clinically diagnosed with DCM or ARVC Arg(9) → Cys (R9C) and Arg(14) deletion (R14del) mutations in PLN are associated with lethal dilated cardiomyopathy in humans We previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients. Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; Mutations in the PLN gene are a rare cause of heart failure, present almost exclusively in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy etiology A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death. Complete genetic and clinical analyses were performed in a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy due to the PLN-R14Del mutation. A candidate gene approach resulted in identification of a heterozygous deletion of arginine 14 in the gene encoding phospholamban (PLN-R14Del) segregating with dilated cardiomyopathy in the family pedigree. Mutation carriers suffered from familial dilated cardiomyopathy associated with cardiac death between the ages of 26 and 50 years. a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy due to the PLN-R14Del mutation. For the phospholamban (PLN) and titin cap (TTN) genes, a direct mutation screening approach was used. DNA sequence analysis of all exons showed no evidence that these genes are involved in DCM in the Newfoundland dog. two human PLN mutations, associated with either absence or sustained dephosphorylation of PLN, were linked to dilated cardiomyopathy. Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by early onset and the presence of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. The identical PLN mutation can be associated with both mild and severe forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, PLN mutations should be considered in late onset cardiomyopathy Through genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identified a previously uncharacterized deletion of arginine 14 (PLN-R14Del) in the coding region of the phospholamban (PLN) gene in a large family with hereditary heart failure. No PLN gene mutation was found in patients with DCM in Chengdu. This result indicated that PLN gene mutation may not be a common cause for DCM in the Chinese population in Chengdu. none in PLN the recent discoveries of human PLN mutations leading to disease states. Strikingly, both individuals homozygous for L39stop developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27. humans lacking PLN develop lethal dilated cardiomyopathy. Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN)"

Is flibanserin effetive for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder?,yes,"Mechanism of action of flibanserin, a multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA), in hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Flibanserin is a novel multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA) that improves sexual functioning in premenopausal women who suffer from reduced sexual interest and desire. Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Sprout Pharmaceuticals is only for premenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: In naturally postmenopausal women with HSDD, flibanserin, compared with placebo, has been associated with improvement in sexual desire, improvement in the number of SSEs, and reduced distress associated with low sexual desire, and is well tolerated. INTRODUCTION: Flibanserin is a mixed 5-HT1A agonist/5-HT2A antagonist that has been developed for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women BACKGROUND: Flibanserin, a novel serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonist and 5-HT(2A) antagonist, has been shown to increase sexual desire and reduce distress in women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD).  Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most commonly described form of female sexual dysfunction. There is currently no pharmacological therapy approved to treat HSDD, and therefore, there is an unmet medical need for the development of efficacious treatment alternatives. Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U.S.  Sexual function adverse events across flibanserin groups were generally comparable to placebo.Although these studies were not designed or powered to compare sexual function outcomes, results suggested a potential benefit of flibanserin on sexual function, particularly on female sexual desire, and provided a rationale to evaluate the efficacy of flibanserin as a treatment for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder."
Is recommended the use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting?,no,"Short duration postoperative iv T(3) therapy increases cardiac index and does not alter mortality. We conclude that although widespread interest has been shown on the use of thyroid hormones in the perioperative period, and the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid hormone metabolism widely studied, there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. There is no clear evidence at this point to support thyroid hormone replacement in the latter patients, and it may be potentially harmful. Rather, we hold that T3 treatment of various surgical and other patients with nonthyroidal illness should be deferred until proof of its therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated. Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Routine use after coronary surgery is thus not recommended. Although mild effects on myocardial performance may exist, we cannot recommend at this time the routine use of intravenous T(3) as an inotropic agent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy. Thus, there seems to be no sound justification for a routine use of T3 in patients undergoing open-heart procedures."
Isn't transcapillary albumin escape altered in diabetic patients?,no,"On the contrary, altered TERalb and increased carotid artery intimal thickness are shown by all hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, both with normal and altered patterns of AER. Altered systemic capillary permeability characterizes insulin-resistant hypertensive patients with Metabolic Syndrome. TERalb is increased in normo-albuminuric type 1 diabetic patients."
Is indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease?,no,"We and others have published observational epidemiologic studies in support of vitamins in the primary prevention of CVD, but the results from intervention studies are mixed. For vitamin E, observational data suggest benefit at doses of 100 to 400 IU/d. Results from recent large-scale trials are mixed, with some showing modest benefit but others suggesting no benefit, especially for secondary prevention. Results for B vitamins are also mixed and further complicated by the recent folate fortification of the flour supply. If greater B vitamin intake does reduce CVD, the benefits are likely to be greatest for primary prevention and in populations with intake below dietary reference standards.  In the dose-response meta-analysis, each 30 mg/day increase in vitamin C, 30 IU/day increase in vitamin E, and 1 mg/day increase in beta-carotene yielded the estimated overall relative risk for CHD of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.02), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99), and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.88-1.14), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in this meta-analysis suggest that an increase in dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins has encouraging prospects for possible CHD prevention. High levels of α-tocopherol in serum were associated with 30% lower CAD risk in another study (HR 0.71; 95%CI 0.53-0.94). Among minerals (zinc, selenium, and chromium), an inverse association between zinc and CAD was observed; levels lower than 14.1 µmol/L were associated with an increased risk for CAD (RR 1.70; 95%CI 1.21-2.38). The information available on this issue is scarce. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of these nutrients in the cardiovascular risk of patients with diabetes. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation at a dosage of 150 mg appears to decrease the inflammatory marker IL-6 in patients with CAD.  Coenzyme Q10 supplements at a dose of 150 mg can decrease oxidative stress and increase antioxidant enzyme activity in patients with CAD. A higher dose of coenzyme Q10 supplements (>150 mg/d) might promote rapid and sustainable antioxidation in patients with CAD. Alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplementation has no protective effect on macrovascular outcomes or total mortality of diabetic male smokers. Sodium selenite supplementation increases GPx-1 activity in endothelial cells and in CAD patients. Future studies have to demonstrate whether long-term CAD outcome can be improved. After 7.3 years of treatment and follow-up, a combination pill of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 did not reduce a combined end point of total cardiovascular events among high-risk women, despite significant homocysteine lowering.  In this population-based study, vitamin E use was unrelated to mortality, but this apparently null finding seems to represent a combination of increased mortality in those with severe cardiovascular disease and a possible protective effect in those without.  In this large cohort of apparently healthy US male physicians, self-selected supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C, or multivitamins was not associated with a significant decrease in total CVD or CHD mortality.  The American Heart Association has recommended consumption of a balanced diet with emphasis on antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables but has made no recommendations regarding vitamin E supplementation for the general population. Although vitamin E supplementation seems to be safe for most people, recommendations from health care professionals should reflect the uncertainty of established benefit as demonstrated in clinical trials Recent studies show that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins E and C have benefits in CHD prevention; however, supplementation with beta-carotene may have deleterious effects and is not recommended. Current evidence suggests that patients with CHD would probably benefit from taking vitamin E in a dosage of 400 IU per day and vitamin C in a dosage of 500 to 1,000 mg per day. Clinicians may also want to consider vitamin supplementation for CHD prevention in high-risk patients. Folate lowers elevated homocysteine levels, but evidence for routine supplemental use does not yet exist.  In patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, treatment with vitamin E for a mean of 4.5 years had no apparent effect on cardiovascular outcomes."

Could transcription factors act as cell-cell signalling molecules?,yes,"Pax6 is a transcription factor essential for the development of tissues including the eyes, central nervous system and endocrine glands of vertebrates and invertebrates. It regulates the expression of a broad range of molecules, including transcription factors, cell adhesion and short-range cell-cell signalling molecules, hormones and structural proteins Recent data support the view that transcription factors - in particular, homeoproteins - can be transferred from cell to cell and have direct non-cell-autonomous (and therefore paracrine) activities"

Isn't pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism effective in reducing cardiovascular events?,yes,"The decision to treat elderly people is still an unresolved clinical challenge--first, due to a lack of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials of L-T4 in sHT patients, examining cardiovascular hard endpoints in various classes of age; and second, because of the negative effects of possible overtreatment. The lack of specific randomized trials enrolling either old or very old subjects, aimed at evaluate the efficacy of hormonal replacement on overall survival and cardiovascular risk reduction along with the negative effects of possible over-treatment, makes the decision to treat older people a still unresolved clinical challenge In patients with type 2 DM, the presence of SH serves as an additional risk factor for endothelial dysfunction. Treatment of SCH with levothyroxine was associated with fewer IHD events in younger individuals, but this was not evident in older people. Subclinical hyperthyroidism seems to be a risk factor of developing major cardiovascular events, especially stroke in older adults from the general population with normal left ventricular function. SCH appears to influence the postoperative outcome for patients by increasing the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unproven whether preoperative thyroxine replacement therapy for patients with SCH might prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after CABG. In CHF patients TSH levels even slightly above normal range are independently associated with a greater likelihood of heart failure progression. In current RCTs, levothyroxine replacement therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity. Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between intervention groups. However, the actual effectiveness of thyroid hormone substitution in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, the multiplicity and the possible reversibility of subclinical hypothyroidism-associated cardiovascular abnormalities suggest that the decision to treat a patient should depend on the presence of risk factors, rather than on a TSH threshold.  However, whether SH confers a high risk for cardiovascular disease, and whether LT4 therapy has a long-term benefit that clearly outweighs the risks of overzealous treatment in these individuals, remain topics of controversy."
Are histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors good candidates to control metastasis of solid tumors?,yes,"JNJ-26481585 also fully inhibited the growth of C170HM2 colorectal liver metastases, whereas again 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin showed modest activity. Although not meeting the RECIST response criteria for adequate single-agent activity, the observed tolerable toxicities and the potential for clinical benefit in terms of stable disease suggest that further assessment of vorinostat as a part of combination therapy with either chemotherapeutic or targeted agents in metastatic breast might be undertaken. Treatments of different structural classes of HDACi simultaneously induced cell death and promoted cell migration and metastasis in multiple cancer cell types. Suppression of HDACi-induced PKCs leads to development of low toxic and long-term therapeutic strategies to potentially treat cancer as a chronic disease. mRNA expression analysis of lung tumor bearing mice suggested that the enhanced chemopreventive activity of the combination is related to atorvastatin modulation of DNA repair, SAHA modulation of angiogenesis, and both drugs modulating invasion and metastasis pathways. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induced morphologic differentiation, cell-cycle exit, and a shift to a differentiated, melanocytic gene expression profile in cultured UM cells. VPA inhibited the growth of UM tumors in vivo. When both drugs were used in concert additive effects were observed on the migratory and invasive behavior but not on tumor-endothelium and tumor-matrix interaction. Separate mTOR or HDAC inhibition slows processes related to tumor metastasis. The RAD001-VPA combination showed advantage over VPA monotreatment with particular respect to migration and invasion. In conclusion, sequential treatments of mice with MS-275 followed by TRAIL may target multiple pathways to reverse EMT and inhibit tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis and represent a novel therapeutic approach to treat cancer. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. We report the first preclinical data for the prevention of brain metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer. Vorinostat is brain permeable and can prevent the formation of brain metastases by 62%. Its mechanism of action involves the induction of DNA double-strand breaks, suggesting rational combinations with DNA active drugs or radiation. Combining vorinostat with radiation may be a potential treatment option for patients with breast cancer who develop brain metastases. Although single-agent PCI-24781 had modest effects on STS growth and metastasis, marked inhibition was observed when combined with chemotherapy. In a 4T1 metastatic breast carcinoma model, AN-7 inhibited the formation of lung lesions by 76% and AN-9 by 47%, further demonstrating the greater efficacy of AN-7 compared to AN-9 (P<0.02). Both AN-7 and AN-9 exhibited antimetastatic and antiangiogenic activities by reducing vascularization, bFGF expression and HIF-1alpha. Since prolonged oral administration with 50 mg/kg or a single oral dose of 1.2 g/kg AN-7 did not cause adverse effects and the former exhibited significant anticancer activity, AN-7 is likely to display a high therapeutic index and may be beneficial for prostate cancer patients. We show that apicidin significantly inhibits H-ras-induced invasive phenotype of MCF10A human breast epithelial cells in parallel with a specific downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, but not MMP-9. We also show that apicidin induces a morphological reversal and growth inhibition of H-ras MCF10A cells similar to that induced by other HDAC inhibitors. We also found that NaB induced three genes, which are known metastatic suppressors, and downregulated 11 genes, which have been shown to promote metastasis."
Isn't muscle lim protein (MLP) involved in cardiomyopathies?,no,"Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease. In line with this notion, the homozygous loss of MLP results in cardiac hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Moreover, MLP is induced in several models of cardiac hypertrophy such as aortic banding and myocardial infarction.  Muscle LIM protein (MLP) null mice are often used as a model for human dilated cardiomyopathy. A lack of MLP leads to an age-dependent impairment of excitation-contraction coupling with resulting contractile dysfunction and secondary fibrosis. Loss of murine MLP results in dilated cardiomyopathy, and mutations in human MLP lead to cardiac hypertrophy, indicating a critical role for MLP in maintaining normal cardiac function. Our data indicate that MLP contributes to muscle stiffness and is necessary for maximum work and power generation. Interestingly, MLP was also found to be down-regulated in humans with heart failure (Zolk et al. Circulation 101:2674-2677, 2000) and MLP mutations are able to cause hypertrophic and dilated forms of cardiomyopathy in humans (Bos et al. Mol Genet Metab 88:78-85, 2006; Geier et al. Circulation 107:1390-1395, 2003; Hershberger et al. Clin Transl Sci 1:21-26, 2008; Knöll et al. Cell 111:943-955, 2002; Knöll et al. Circ Res 106:695-704, 2010; Mohapatra et al. Mol Genet Metab 80:207-215, 2003). MLP soon became an important model for experimental cardiology when it was first demonstrated that MLP deficiency leads to myocardial hypertrophy followed by a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure phenotype (Arber et al. Cell 88:393-403, 1997).  Previous studies have shown an association between CSRP3 missense mutations and either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or HCM, but all these studies were unable to provide comprehensive genetic evidence for a causative role of CSRP3 mutations.  We used a newly designed monoclonal antibody to show that muscle LIM protein (MLP), the protein encoded by CSRP3, is mainly a cytosolic component of cardiomyocytes and not tightly anchored to sarcomeric structures. Our functional data from both in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that at least one of MLP's mutated forms seems to be destabilized in the heart of HCM patients harbouring a CSRP3 missense mutation. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a cytoskeletal protein located at the Z-disc of sarcomeres. Mutations in the human MLP gene are associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. Our data demonstrate that Mlp84B is essential for normal cardiac function and establish the Drosophila model for the investigation of the mechanisms connecting defective cardiac Z-disc components to the development of cardiomyopathy. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a cytoskeletal LIM-only protein expressed in striated muscle. Mutations in human MLP are associated with cardiomyopathy; TTN-encoded titin, CSRP3-encoded muscle LIM protein, and TCAP-encoded telethonin are Z-disc proteins essential for the structural organization of the cardiac sarcomere and the cardiomyocyte's stretch sensor. All three genes have been established as cardiomyopathy-associated genes for both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  Approximately 4.1% of unrelated patients had HCM-associated MLP or TCAP mutations. MLP/TCAP-HCM phenotypically mirrors myofilament-HCM and is more severe than the subset of patients who still remain without a disease-causing mutation. The precise role of W4R-MLP in the pathogenesis of either DCM or HCM warrants further investigation. MLP (muscle-LIM-protein) deficient mice develop DCM and changes in the mechanical coupling of cardiomyocytes result in alterations at the intercalated disks and enhanced accumulation of adherens junction proteins. Targeted deletion of cytoskeletal muscle LIM protein (MLP) in mice consistently leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) after one or more months.  In summary, young MLPKO mice revealed substantial alterations in passive myocardial properties and relaxation time, but not in most systolic characteristics. These results indicate that the progression to heart failure in the MLPKO model may be driven by diastolic myocardial dysfunction and abnormal passive properties rather than systolic dysfunction. Mice lacking the muscle LIM protein (MLP) develop morphological and clinical signs resembling human dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Our results show that the absence of MLP causes a local loss of mitochondria. We hypothesize that this is caused by a disturbed interaction between cytoskeleton and mitochondria, which interferes with energy sensing and energy transfer. Recovery of energy depletion by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis might be a useful therapeutic strategy for improving the energy imbalance in heart failure. Previous work has shown that mutations in muscle LIM protein (MLP) can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In order to gain an insight into the molecular basis of the disease phenotype, we analysed the binding characteristics of wild-type MLP and of the (C58G) mutant MLP that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The molecular basis for HCM-causing mutations in the MLP gene might therefore be an alteration in the equilibrium of interactions of the ternary complex MLP-N-RAP-alpha-actinin. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a member of the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family and has been implicated in both myogenesis and sarcomere assembly. In the latter role, it binds zyxin and alpha-actinin, both of which are involved in actin organization. An MLP-deficient mouse has been described; these mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. We identified a patient with DCM and EFE, having a mutation in MLP with the residue lysine 69 substituted by arginine (K69R).  MLP-knockout mice develop a marked cardiac hypertrophy reaction and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MLP is therefore a candidate gene for heritable forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and DCM in humans. Family studies revealed cosegregation of clinically affected individuals with the respective mutations in MLP. CONCLUSION: Here, we present evidence that mutations in the CRP3/MLP gene can cause HCM. The skeletal muscle LIM protein 1 (SLIM1) is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and its expression is downregulated significantly in dilated human cardiomyopathy.  Targeted disruption of muscle LIM protein (MLP) has previously been shown to result in dilated cardiomyopathy with many of the clinical signs of heart failure, although the effects of MLP disruption on passive ventricular mechanics and myocyte architecture are not known. These results suggest that the disruption of the cytoskeletal protein MLP results in less compliant passive tissue and concomitant structural alterations in the three-dimensional myocyte architecture that may in part explain the ventricular dysfunction in the dilated heart.  Mutations in cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3), the gene encoding MLP, have been directly associated with human cardiomyopathies, whereas aberrant expression patterns are reported in human cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease. Previous work has shown that mutations in muscle LIM protein (MLP) can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)"
Have 5q35 microdeletions been implicated in Sotos syndrome development?,yes,"Loss-of-function mutations of NSD1 and 5q35 microdeletions encompassing NSD1 are a major cause of Sotos syndrome (Sos), which is characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, characteristic facies, and variable intellectual disability (ID) We observed a novel 3.5 Mb 5q subtelomeric deletion in a 3-year-old girl with developmental delay, hypotonia and multiple minor anomalies. Comparison of her phenotype with the few published patients with terminal 5q35 deletions revealed several overlapping features, but also showed remarkable differences such as shortness of stature versus macrosomia. After the report of 5q35.3 microdeletions in Sotos syndrome we integrated the published BACs into the public draft sequence and exactly mapped the deletion size in our patient by FISH analysis with 15 BAC probes. We demonstrated that the deletion in our patient is immediately adjacent to the reported Sotos syndrome deletion site Switch in FGFR3 and -4 expression profile during human renal development may account for transient hypercalcemia in patients with Sotos syndrome due to 5q35 microdeletions.

Isn't metabolic syndrome related with cardiovascular disease?,no,"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a cluster of risk factors including central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, The MetS is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  As a molecular link between metabolic signals, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction, resistin can be proposed as playing a significant role in the heightened inflammatory state induced by metabolic stress linked to excessive caloric intake, thus contributing to the risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with a higher risk for both, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.  arotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) has been widely used as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD)"
Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,yes,"Inherited mutations in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes.  Variants in the XRCC3 gene might result in altered protein structure or function which may influence DSBR efficiency and lead to cancer.  Although alcohol consumption is related to increased cancer risk, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that an intake of 10% alcohol for 4 weeks in rats is genotoxic due to induction of micronuclei. Acetaldehyde (AA), the first product of ethanol metabolism, is believed to be responsible for DNA damage induced by alcohol.  Although efficiency of these repair processes substantially decrease the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies that target DNA, compromised DNA repair contributes to mutagenesis and genomic instability leading to carcinogenesis. damage response and repair pathways are important barriers to carcinogenesis.  olymorphisms in DNA repair genes and differences in repair capacity between individuals have been widely documented. For colorectal cancer, the loss of mismatch repair gene activity is a key genetic determinant. Nucleotide excision repair (NER), recombination repair (RR) and base excision repair (BER) pathways have critical roles in protection against other cancers, and we wished to investigate their role in colorectal cancer."
Isn't there a genome-wide technique for the detection of R-loop formation?,no,"Genome-wide analysis of fragile sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microarray (ChIP-chip) of phosphorylated H2A in these mutants supported a transcription-dependent mechanism of DNA damage characteristic of R loops We have used a bisulfite-sensitivity assay to demonstrate genome-wide increase in the occurrence of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops), including from antisense and read-through transcripts, in a nusG missense mutant defective for Rho-dependent termination. The results demonstrate a key function of FACT in the resolution of R-loop-mediated transcription-replication conflicts, likely associated with a specific chromatin organization. Previous work revealed that GC skew and R-loop formation associate with a core set of unmethylated CpG island (CGI) promoters in the human genome"
Can bioprinting use human cells?,yes,"In this study, human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) were printed in a free-scalable 3D grid pattern by means of LaBP.

Is transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) related to gene expression levels?,yes,"These mutations were frequent in plasmid-borne lacS expressed at a high level but not in single-copy lacS in the chromosome or at lower levels of expression in a plasmid. The results suggest that important DNA repair or replication fidelity functions are impaired or overwhelmed in pJlacS, with results analogous to those of the ""transcription-associated mutagenesis"" seen in bacteria and eukaryotes. the rate of point mutation in a gene increases with the expression level of the gene. Transcription induces mutagenesis on both DNA strands, indicating simultaneous actions of several TAM mechanisms. High-levels of transcription through a gene stimulate spontaneous mutation rate, a phenomenon termed transcription-associated mutation (TAM). High levels of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with increased genetic instability, which has been linked to DNA damage. Here, we describe a pGAL-CAN1 forward mutation assay for studying transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) in yeast. The acquisition of mutations was directly correlated to the level of transcription Our results demonstrate that the level of Leu(+) reversions increased significantly in parallel with the induced increase in transcription levels. Transcription-associated mutagenesis in yeast is directly proportional to the level of gene expression spontaneous mutation rate is directly proportional to the transcription level, suggesting that movement of RNA polymerase through the target initiates a mutagenic process(es) High transcription is associated with genetic instability, notably increased spontaneous mutation rates, which is a phenomenon termed Transcription-Associated-Mutagenesis (TAM).

Isn't there a pharmacogenetic test for trastuzumab?,no,"The clinical need for novel approaches to improve drug therapy derives from the high rate of adverse reactions to drugs and their lack of efficacy in many individuals that may be predicted by pharmacogenetic testing. the assessment of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) expression for trastuzumab therapy of breast cancer HER2 positive breast cancer and the use of the drug Herceptin The dependence on gene copy number or expression levels of HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab and cetuximab (Erbitux), respectively, supports the importance of selecting suitable patient populations based on their pharmacogenetic profile. to explore informed consent issues surrounding the use of the drug Herceptin, widely cited as an example of a novel approach to drug development called pharmacogenetics. Drawing on qualitative semi-structured interviews with 25 UK-based breast cancer specialists, this paper explores Herceptin's disputed epistemological status, as an example of pharmacogenetics or as something out of the ordinary in terms of clinical practice. There have been several success stories in the field of pharmacogenetics in recent years, including the analysis of HER2 amplification for trastuzumab selection in breast cancer Trastuzumab is standard of care in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2⁺ early and advanced breast cancer. HER-2 overexpression as a predictor of response to trastuzumab Pharmacogenomic analysis aspires to identify individuals with specific genetic characteristics in order to predict a positive response or reduce a negative response to a therapeutic modality. Assays are available to detect the HER2 protein receptor or copies of the HER2 gene sequence to determine eligibility for Herceptin treatment or adriamycin treatment in node positive patients, respectively. Determining the HER2 status of breast carcinomas is a prerequisite for the use of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), which has recently been licensed for the treatment of metastatic disease. Laboratory testing of HER2/neu in breast carcinoma has become vital to patient care following the approval of trastuzumab as the first therapy to target the HER2/neu oncoprotein. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed with use of a diagnostic test for the assessment of HER2 overexpression, the HercepTest. To test for HER-2/neu overexpression in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the possible role of the recombinant monoclonal anti-HER-2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To evaluate concordance between local and central laboratory HER2 testing results in patients from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 adjuvant trial of trastuzumab. These findings support the importance of using high-volume, experienced laboratories for HER2 testing to improve the process of selecting patients likely to benefit from trastuzumab therapy. we measured trastuzumab levels in the serum and in cerebrospinal fluid of metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases receiving trastuzumab for HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In a pilot study, metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases and HER2-overexpressing tumors (HercepTest; Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) were included. Monitoring of trastuzumab levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid may enable individualized therapy strategies in metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases, and lead to a better understanding of trastuzumab pharmacokinetics in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Biotin-labeled trastuzumab (BiotHER) can be used to test for HER2 by immunohistochemistry. The results support a role for BiotHER testing in better tailoring trastuzumab-based treatments in patients with advanced HER2-amplified breast cancers. response to anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy trastuzumab."
Do carmustine wafers improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,yes,"At recurrence, treatment options include repeat surgery (with or without Gliadel wafer placement), reirradiation or systemic therapy.  DISCUSSION: Carmustine wafers for primary HGG surgery in accordance with the NICE TA121 were associated with a median survival of 15.3 months; this is improved compared with previously reported randomised trials. Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival. Gliadel wafer is a new approach to the treatment of glioblastoma, which involves controlled release delivery of carmustine from biodegradable polymer wafers. It has shown promising results and provides a silver lining for glioblastoma patients. For patient with and without Gliadel, median and 1-year RFS were 12.9 months and 52% vs. 14 months and 42%, respectively (p = 0.89). According to pathology, Gliadel did not influence OS of patients with Grade III or glioblastoma CONCLUSION: In patients with high-grade gliomas, adding Gliadel before performing a Stupp protocol did not improve survival. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma.  CONCLUSIONS: The combination of aggressive resection, Gliadel wafer implantation, and GKS in addition to standard fractionated RT in selected patients resulted in increased local control and increased survival compared with a historical control group treated with surgery and involved-field RT alone. OBJECT: Gliadel (BCNU) wafer and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) therapy, when used individually as adjuvant therapies, extend survival from that achieved by resection and radiation therapy (XRT) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  BACKGROUND: Gliadel (polifeprosan 20 with carmustine [BCNU] implant) is commonly used for local delivery of BCNU to high-grade gliomas after resection and is associated with increased survival. Temozolomide administered according to this protocol produced a median survival benefit of 2 months in glioblastomas, and carmustine a similar benefit in high-grade gliomas. Analysis of a large trial by Westphal and colleagues (n = 240) showed a 29% risk reduction (P = 0.03) in the BCNU wafer-treated group over the course of the 30-month trial. Median survival of patients treated with BCNU wafers was 13.8 months vs 11.6 months in placebo-treated patients (P = 0.017) with a hazard ratio of 0.73 (P = 0.018), representing a 27% significant risk reduction. This survival advantage was maintained at 1, 2, and 3 years and was statistically significant (P = 0.01) at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Malignant glioma patients treated with BCNU wafers at the time of initial surgery in combination with radiation therapy demonstrated a survival advantage at 2 and 3 years follow-up compared with placebo. OBJECTIVE: Recently a randomized placebo-controlled phase III trial of biodegradable polymers containing carmustine has demonstrated a significant survival benefit for patients treated with local chemotherapy.  CONCLUSION: In this subgroup analysis of a phase III trial population both the clinical progression and radiological progression were significantly delayed in patients treated with local chemotherapy, resulting in an increased survival time. A previous placebo-controlled trial has shown that biodegradable 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers. Median survival in the intent-to-treat group was 13.9 months for the BCNU wafer-treated group and 11.6 months for the placebo-treated group (log-rank P -value stratified by country = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death in the treatment group. When adjusted for factors affecting survival, the treatment effect remained positive with a risk reduction of 28% ( P = 0.03).  Controlled release delivery of carmustine from biodegradable polymer wafers was approved as an adjunct to surgical resection in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme after it was shown in clinical trials to be well tolerated and effective.  Clinical trials have demonstrated significant improvements in survival and quality of life for patients after complete tumour resection and BCNU wafer implantation. BCNU wafers are an effective means of increasing survival and quality of life in patients diagnosed with malignant glioma, and are a valuable addition to the overall multimodal treatment strategy for these tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Carmustine wafer with concurrent TMZ and radiation followed by rotational chemotherapy is a well tolerated, effective therapy, and has a survival benefit compared with radiation alone. Median overall survival in 14 studies of newly-diagnosed patients suggested a modest improvement versus resection followed by Stupp protocol or resection with BCNU wafers, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile. The efficacy of carmustine wafers for older patients with glioblastoma multiforme: prolonging survival. DISCUSSION: Older patients with GBM may benefit from carmustine wafers. The survival for older patients who received carmustine wafers is significantly longer than matched patients who did not receive carmustine wafers. For glioblastoma patients who received ≥90% resection in the BCNU wafer study, median survival increased for BCNU wafer versus placebo (14.5 versus 12.4 months, respectively; P = 0.02), but no survival increase was found for <90% resection (11.7 versus 10.6 months, respectively; P = 0.98). A wafer impregnated with carmustine, for use as an implant after surgical removal of recurrent GBM showed a prolongation in the median survival time of only 2 mo, from 20 to 28 wk in a study with a total of 222 patients.  No clear survival benefit associated with wafer implantation was identified. In three of the trials, patients with GBM who received carmustine wafers had significantly longer median survival than patients who did not receive wafers.  TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials .  The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events.  For patients undergoing repeat resection for malignant glioma, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated a median survival for 110 patients who received carmustine polymers of 31 weeks compared with 23 weeks for 122 patients who only received placebo polymers. Median survival was improved from 11.6 to 13.9 months (P = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death. When patients with glioblastoma multiforme alone were analyzed, the median survival improved from 11.4 to 13.5 months, but this improvement was not statistically significant.  OBJECT: Locoregional chemotherapy with carmustine wafers, positioned at surgery and followed by radiation therapy, has been shown to prolong survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, as has concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival. The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events. However, patients with carmustine wafers demonstrated prolonged survival as compared to patients without wafers. The median survival for patients with carmustine wafers was 8.7 months, while median survival for patients without wafers was 5.5 months (P=0.007). Likewise, in subgroup analysis, patients older than 70 years (P=0.0003) and 75 years (P=0.04) who had carmustine wafers had significantly longer survival than matched patients without wafers. Implantation of carmustine wafers did not significantly improve progression-free survival In three of the trials, patients with GBM who received carmustine wafers had significantly longer median survival than patients who did not receive wafers A previous placebo-controlled trial has shown that biodegradable 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials"
Is hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents a hallmark of Fanconi anemia?,yes,"The Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex plays a central role in the DNA damage response network FAAP100-deficient cells display hallmark features of FA cells, including defective FANCD2 monoubiquitination, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and genomic instability. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by aplastic anemia, cancer/leukemia susceptibility and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, such as cisplatin. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited chromosomal recessive syndrome characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and bone marrow failure, which cause aplastic anemia, and an increased incidence of malignancy. Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of DNA repair in Fanconi anemia. Fanconi anemia (FA) is one of several genetic diseases with characteristic cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents which suggest that FA proteins may function as part of DNA repair processes. Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, but how the Fanconi pathway protects cells from DNA crosslinks and whether FA proteins act directly on crosslinks remain unclear. Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder associated with a bone-marrow failure, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a heterogeneous disease associated with a bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized by defective DNA repair and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease characterized by bone marrow failure, increased cancer risk and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, implying a role for this pathway in the maintenance of genomic stability. Genetic or epigenetic inactivation of the pathway formed by the Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins occurs in several cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), rendering the affected tumors potentially hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agents. Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare autosomic recessive and X-linked disease with chromosomal instability after exposure to crosslinking agents as the hallmark. Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by chromosome instability, cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, and increased predisposition to malignancies. The Bloom protein (BLM) and Topoisomerase IIIalpha are found in association with proteins of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, a disorder manifesting increased cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Using siRNA depletion and gene knockout techniques, we show that FAAP100-deficient cells display hallmark features of FA cells, including defective FANCD2 monoubiquitination, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and genomic instability. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive human cancer prone syndrome featuring bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents exposure. FA is a chromosome instability syndrome characterized by childhood-onset aplastic anemia, cancer or leukemia susceptibility, and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Functional defects in the Fanconi pathway can result in a marked hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslinking agents, such as mitomycin C. At the cellular level, hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinks is the defining feature in Fanconi anemia. DNA crosslinking agents may led to DNA cross-linking lesion, and Fanconi anemia pathway plays a key role in repairing its cross-linking. Fanconi anemia (FA), an autosomal recessive disorder of children, is characterized by congenital or childhood aplastic anemia, multiple developmental anomalies, increased incidence of myeloid leukemia, increased spontaneous chromosome breakage, and cellular and chromosomal hypersensitivity to DNA bifunctional crosslinking and alkylating agents. elegans provides an excellent model system for the study of the Fanconi Anemia (FA), one of the hallmarks of which is sensitivity to interstrand crosslinking agents Using siRNA depletion and gene knockout techniques, we show that FAAP100-deficient cells display hallmark features of FA cells, including defective FANCD2 monoubiquitination, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and genomic instability One of the hallmark phenotypes of FA is cellular hypersensitivity to agents that induce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), such as mitomycin C (MMC) Furthermore, the cytological hallmark of FA, the DNA crosslink-induced radial chromosome formation, exemplifies an innate impairment in the repair of these particularly cytotoxic DNA lesions [A.D Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, but how the Fanconi pathway protects cells from DNA crosslinks and whether FA proteins act directly on crosslinks remain unclear Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of DNA repair in Fanconi anemia Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited chromosomal recessive syndrome characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and bone marrow failure, which cause aplastic anemia, and an increased incidence of malignancy Genetic or epigenetic inactivation of the pathway formed by the Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins occurs in several cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), rendering the affected tumors potentially hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agents Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human autosomal disorder characterized by cancer susceptibility and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C and diepoxybutane The Fanconi anemia pathway promotes DNA glycosylase-dependent excision of interstrand DNA crosslinks.

Although a number of disease genes have been identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type 6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6, but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been identified.METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion a childhood onset neuropathy and optic atrophy.

We described a large consanguineous family with neuropathy and optic atrophy carrying a loss of function mutation in the C12orf65 gene. In these patients, we identified a homozygous splice mutation, g.21043 T>A (c.282+2 T>A) which leads to skipping of exon 2.

Is cystatin C or cystatin 3 used as a biomarker of kidney function?,yes,"to explore the effect of ageing on renal function with cystatin C as the marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the general population without vascular disease or diabetes. Cystatin C, a more specific kidney function biomarker, was also elevated at 24 h after CLP. This study evaluated FGF-23 as well as traditional markers of kidney disease, namely urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and creatinine-cystatin C estimated GFR (eGFRCrCyC), as risk factors for AKI in elderly individuals.  he primary predictor was estimated GFR (eGFR) calculated using serum cystatin C (eGFR(cys)). A number of recent reports have suggested that the cystatin C/creatinine (CysC/Cr) ratio might be a useful biomarker of renal function in pediatric patients. The CKD-EPI equation using cystatin C was the most precise method of renal function evaluation in patients with neurogenic bladder. Serum cystatin C (CysC) is an endogenous marker of kidney function. The urinary content of CysC reflects tubular epithelial dysfunction whereas that of NGAL also characterizes tubular atrophy. Estimated kidney function based on serum cystatin C  : Several formulas for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation, based on serum creatinine or cystatin C, have been proposed.  he highest and lowest eGFR levels corresponded to the cystatin C-based and MDRD-4 equations, respectively.  The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) recently proposed an equation to estimate GFR in subjects without cirrhosis using both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels. Emerging evidence has shown that cystatin C may improve classification of glomerular filtration rate for defining chronic kidney disease in certain clinical populations and assist in understanding the complications of chronic kidney disease Beta-trace protein (BTP) and cystatin C (CysC) are novel biomarkers of renal function.  Cystatin C could improve chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification in HIV-infected women relative to serum creatinine.  Iohexol clearance and cystatin C formulae identify a greater proportion of patients with a GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), which also predicts the development of AKI.  Cystatin C was recently reported to be an endogenous surrogate of kidney function, and a high level of cystatin C is reported to be a strong predictor of CVD; Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer ones such as cystatin C or β-trace protein)"

RAPIDR (Reliable Accurate Prenatal non-Invasive Diagnosis R package) is an easy-to-use open-source R package that implements several published NIPT analysis methods. The clinical data collected thus far indicate that NIPT is highly sensitive in detecting trisomies 21 and 18, and fairly sensitive in detecting trisomy 13 and sex chromosome aneuploidies. Because false-positive results may occur, an abnormal result must be validated by invasive prenatal testing. When non-invasive prenatal screening for aneuploidy is available, maternal age alone should not be an indication for invasive prenatal diagnosis in a twin pregnancy. (II-2A) If non-invasive prenatal screening is not available, invasive prenatal diagnosis in twins should be offered to women aged 35 and over. Therefore, methods with high sensitivity and precision are required to detect and differentiate fetal DNA from the large background of maternal DNA.

Doesn't thyroid hormone receptor beta1 affect insulin secretion?,yes,"We demonstrated that thyroid hormone T3 rapidly induces Akt activation in pancreatic beta cells rRINm5F and hCM via thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta1. The silencing of TRbeta1 expression through RNAi confirmed this receptor to be crucial for the T3-induced activation of Akt. T3 is able to specifically activate Akt in the islet beta cells rRINm5F and hCM through the interaction between TRbeta1 and PI3K p85alpha, demonstrating the involvement of TRbeta1 in this novel T3 non-genomic action in islet beta cells."
Aren't there plasma membrane receptors for thyroid hormones?,no,"ntegrins are heterodimeric structural components of the plasma membrane whose ligands include a large number of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  Recently, integrin αvβ3 has been shown to have a panel of previously unappreciated small molecule receptor sites for thyroid hormone and hormone analogues, for dihydrotestosterone, and for resveratrol, a polyphenol that has certain estrogen-like features. The integrin receptor activation by T4 may take a role in plasma membrane processes involved in the male reproductive system. Rapid signaling via this plasma membrane binding site appears to be responsible for many nongenomic effects of thyroid hormones, independent of the classic nuclear receptors."
Doesn't resveratrol reduce cardiac remodeling?,no,"In conclusion, resveratrol attenuated cardiac oxidative damage and left ventricular remodeling and enhanced the decreased expression of SIRT1 in hearts of old rats with emphysema and thus might be a therapeutic modality for cardiac injury complicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In conclusion, resveratrol is a beneficial pharmacological tool that augments autophagy to bring about reverse remodeling in the postinfarction heart. Resveratrol administration reduced atrial CSPC loss, succeeded in preserving the functional abilities of CSPCs and mature cardiac cells, improved cardiac environment by reducing inflammatory state and decreased unfavorable ventricular remodeling of the diabetic heart, leading to a marked recovery of ventricular function. These findings indicate that RSV can constitute an adjuvant therapeutic option in DCM prevention."
Don't R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication?,no,"Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI. We propose that the organized structure of the R-loop is critical for primer RNA function in vivo with important implications for the RNA processing and DNA replication machinery. The precursor primer RNA exists as a persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, known as an R-loop, formed during transcription through the replication origin (Xu, B., and Clayton, D. A. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 3135-3143). We found that overproduction of RecG protein drastically decreased copy numbers of ColE1-type plasmids, which require R-loop formation between the template DNA and a primer RNA transcript (RNA II) for the initiation of replication. These results suggest that overproduced RecG inhibits the initiation of replication by prematurely resolving the R-loops formed at the replication origin region of these plasmids with its unique helicase activity. The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed. We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. This would allow replication to proceed while the original block is repaired or bypassed Furthermore, increased RNaseH expression significantly alleviated genomic instability in deficient fibroblasts suggesting that cotranscriptional R-loops formation contributes to the genesis of replication-dependent DSBs in these cells. Transcription is an important source of replicative stress and consequently, maintenance of genome integrity requires the protection of chromosomes from the deleterious effects arising from the interaction between nascent RNAs and template DNA, leading to stable DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loop) formation. Strikingly, we found that attenuation of replication strongly suppresses R-loop-mediated DNA rearrangements in both E. coli and HeLa cells. More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stabilit R-loop-mediated genomic instability is caused by impairment of replication fork progression When any of these processes are not properly coordinated, aberrant outcomes such as fork reversal and R-loop formation arise and trigger unscheduled recombinogenic events and genome rearrangements.  Many studies show that cells can manage R loop formation with efficiency, and can also process the R-loops already formed in the cell, and by which, the bad effects of R-loops on DNA replication, gene mutation and homologous recombination can be regulated. Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells.  In agreement with this, we found that R-loops co-localize with the ORC within the same CpG island region in a significant fraction of these efficient replication origins, precisely at the position displaying the highest density of G4 motifs.  connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. We show that RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) form at sites of transcription/replication collisions and that RNase H1 functions to suppress CFS instability. R-loops and initiation of DNA replication in human cells: a missing link? Stable RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) prime the initiation of replication in Escherichia coli cells. We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. Immediately after infection, RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) occur on (at least some) replication origins, with the annealed RNA serving as a primer for leading-strand synthesis in one direction. Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. ColE1 plasmid origins of replication and oriK sites initiate primosome assembly by an RNA-DNA hybrid structure known as R-loop. This scenario builds on the connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. The multiple cleavage sites on the R-loop substrate match the priming sites observed in vivo, suggesting that RNase MRP alone is capable of generating virtually all of the leading-strand replication primers. Mechanisms of primer RNA synthesis and D-loop/R-loop-dependent DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Alternative oriC-independent modes of replication initiation are possible, one of which is constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR) from transcription-associated RNA-DNA hybrids or R-loops. Our results suggest that Top1 execute this function by suppressing the formation of DNA-RNA hybrids during transcription, these so-called R-loops interfering with the progression of replication forks. Critical role of R-loops in processing replication blocks. The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed. Competition between the RNA transcript and the nontemplate DNA strand during R-loop formation in vitro: a nick can serve as a strong R-loop initiation site. More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stability.  Consistent with this hypothesis, the 3' ends of the mitochondrial R-loop formed by in vitro transcription are located close to the initiation sites of the mitochondrial DNA replication.  A hybrid G-quadruplex structure formed between RNA and DNA explains the extraordinary stability of the mitochondrial R-loop. Previous studies have shown that the newly synthesized primers form a stable and persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, a R-loop, near the leading-strand origin of DNA replication.  Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI."
Is STAT3 involved in EIF2AK2-dependent suppression of autophagy?,yes,"STAT3 may act as a competitive inhibitor of EIF2AK2. Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy. Conversely, the overexpression of wild-type STAT3 as well as of STAT3 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by JAK2 or are excluded from the nucleus inhibits autophagy. However, STAT3 mutants that fail to interact with EIF2AK2 are unable to suppress autophagy Both STAT3-targeting agents (i.e., Stattic, JSI-124 and WP1066) and EIF2AK2 activators (such as the double-strand RNA mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) are capable of disrupting the inhibitory interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 in cellula A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex These results reveal an unsuspected crosstalk between cellular metabolism (fatty acids), pro-inflammatory signaling (STAT3), innate immunity (EIF2AK2), and translational control (EIF2S1) that regulates autophagy Cytoplasmic STAT3 represses autophagy by inhibiting PKR activity The SH2 domain of STAT3 was found to interact with the catalytic domain of the eIF2α kinase 2 EIF2AK2, best known as protein kinase R (PKR). Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulated the activating phosphorylation of PKR and consequent eIF2α hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PKR depletion inhibited autophagy as initiated by chemical STAT3 inhibitors or free fatty acids like palmitate STAT3-targeting chemicals and palmitate caused the disruption of inhibitory STAT3-PKR interactions, followed by PKR-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation, which facilitates autophagy induction Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy. A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex as well as the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (MAPK8/JNK1) and EIF2S1. A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex as well as the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (MAPK8/JNK1) and EIF2S1 Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy However, STAT3 mutants that fail to interact with EIF2AK2 are unable to suppress autophagy Direct interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 controls fatty acid-induced autophagy A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex as well as the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (MAPK8/JNK1) and EIF2S1.  Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy.  Direct interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 controls fatty acid-induced autophagy. These results unravel an unsuspected mechanism of autophagy control that involves STAT3 and PKR as interacting partners. Both STAT3-targeting agents (i.e., Stattic, JSI-124 and WP1066) and EIF2AK2 activators (such as the double-strand RNA mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) are capable of disrupting the inhibitory interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 in cellula, yet only the latter does so in cell-free systems in vitro. A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex as well as the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (MAPK8/JNK1) and EIF2S1.

Isn't STAT3 involved in EIF2AK2-dependent suppression of autophagy?,no,"STAT3 may act as a competitive inhibitor of EIF2AK2. Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy. Conversely, the overexpression of wild-type STAT3 as well as of STAT3 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by JAK2 or are excluded from the nucleus inhibits autophagy.

Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulated the activating phosphorylation of PKR and consequent eIF2α hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PKR depletion inhibited autophagy as initiated by chemical STAT3 inhibitors or free fatty acids like palmitate STAT3-targeting chemicals and palmitate caused the disruption of inhibitory STAT3-PKR interactions, followed by PKR-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation, which facilitates autophagy induction Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy.

Are CTCF and BORIS involved in genome regulation and cancer?,yes,"CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and plays diverse roles in gene regulation, imprinting, insulation, intra/interchromosomal interactions, nuclear compartmentalisation, and alternative splicing. CTCF has a single paralogue, the testes-specific CTCF-like gene (CTCFL)/BORIS. CTCF and BORIS can be deregulated in cancer. The tumour suppressor gene CTCF can be mutated or deleted in cancer, or CTCF DNA binding can be altered by epigenetic changes. BORIS is aberrantly expressed frequently in cancer, leading some to propose a pro-tumourigenic role for BORIS. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation  The investigation of the molecular mechanisms engaged by CTCF to modulate tumor-related genes emphasizes the cell-type dependency of its tumor suppressor role. Indeed, the ability of CTCF to bind their promoters strictly depends by cell-type features as DNA methylation, BORIS-binding and post-translational modifications as PARYlation Moreover, reduction of CTCF in normally BORIS-negative human fibroblasts resulted in derepression of BORIS promoters. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding cancer-related associations between haploinsufficiency of CTCF and BORIS derepression, and between the lack of functional p53 and aberrant activation of BORIS CTCF and BORIS in genome regulation and cancer. The novel BORIS + CTCF gene family is uniquely involved in the epigenetics of normal biology and cancer. Collectively, these data indicate that reciprocal binding of CTCF and BORIS to the NY-ESO-1 promoter mediates epigenetic regulation of this CT gene in lung cancer cells, and suggest that induction of BORIS may be a novel strategy to augment immunogenicity of pulmonary carcinomas. BORIS is the only known paralog of CTCF, a gene intimately involved in genomic imprinting, chromatin insulation, and nuclear regulation. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation. We suggest that BORIS is likely tethering epigenetic machinery to a novel class of CTCF/BORIS 11ZF target sequences that mediate induction of cancer-testis genes. Unlike CTCF, BORIS expression has been reported only in the testis and certain malignancies, leading to its classification as a ""cancer-testis"" antigen."

Are there clinical trials using stem cells for the treatment of cardiac disease?,yes,"Therapy with mesenchymal stem cells is one of the promising tools to improve outcomes after myocardial infarction. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are an ideal source of mesenchymal stem cells due to their abundance and ease of preparation. Furthermore, several ongoing clinical trials using ASCs are producing promising results for heart diseases. Among the cell types under investigation, adult mesenchymal stem cells are widely studied, and in early stage, clinical studies show promise for repair and regeneration of cardiac tissues.  Accumulating data from preclinical and early phase clinical trials document their safety when delivered as either autologous or allogeneic forms in a range of cardiovascular diseases, but also importantly define parameters of clinical efficacy that justify further investigation in larger clinical trials.  several ongoing clinical trials using ASCs are producing promising results for heart diseases.  Clinical application of adult stem cells for therapy for cardiac disease. Stem cell-based therapies have the potential to fundamentally transform the treatment of ischemic cardiac injury and heart failure by achieving what would have been unthinkable only a few years ago-the Holy Grail of myocardial regeneration. Recent therapeutic approaches involve bone marrow (BM)-derived mononuclear cells and their subsets such as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells as well as adipose tissue-derived MSCs, cardiac tissue-derived stem cells, and cell combinations. Clinical trials employing these cells have demonstrated that cellular therapy is feasible and safe.

Among the cell types under investigation, adult mesenchymal stem cells are widely studied, and in early stage, clinical studies show promise for repair and regeneration of cardiac tissues.  Over the past 2 decades, there have been numerous stem cell studies focused on cardiac diseases, ranging from proof-of-concept to phase 2 trials.  Small uncontrolled clinical trials have demonstrated cardiac stem cells as a treatment option for cardiomyopathy. Stem cell populations are rapidly increasing, and we are still in the search of optimal cell types to use in clinical trials as bone marrow stem cells did not show significant improvement in cardiac function following transplantation. Several clinical trials using adult stem cell have shown improvements in cardiac function, however, the mechanism of their action is unclear and widespread tissue regeneration is not evident. As we await results from larger and more prolonged clinical trials, the science of stem cell therapy in cardiac disease keeps progressing. Stem cell therapy for treatment of cardiac disease has shown therapeutic potential. It should be noted that stem cell therapy is not limited to the treatment of ischemic cardiac disease. Over the past 2 decades, there have been numerous stem cell studies focused on cardiac diseases, ranging from proof-of-concept to phase 2 trials. This series of papers focuses on the legacy of these studies and the outlook for future treatment of cardiac diseases with stem cell therapies. Cell transplantation to repair or regenerate injured myocardium is a new frontier in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.  Current therapies only delay progression of the cardiac disease or replace the diseased heart with cardiac transplantation. Stem cells represent a recently discovered novel approach to the treatment of cardiac failure that may facilitate the replacement of diseased cardiac tissue and subsequently lead to improved cardiac function and cardiac regeneration.

Recent clinical trials have achieved favorable initial endpoints with improvements in cardiac function and clinical symptoms following cellular therapy. we consider how cardiac stem cell biology has led us into clinical trials, and we suggest that achieving true cardiac regeneration in patients may ultimately require resolution of critical controversies in experimental cardiac regeneration. Cell-based therapies and tissue engineering provide new promising platforms to develop upcoming therapeutic options. Initial clinical trials were able to generate promising results. A variety of different stem cell types have been used for the clinical application.   Insights gained from clinical trials of adult stem cells, together with fundamental scientific advances in cardiac stem cell and regenerative biology, are beginning to yield potential new targets and strategies for regenerative therapies.  Early animal trials have demonstrated the ability to improve cardiac function by transfer of HSCs into the myocardium, and early human studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of this approach."
Isn't Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,no,"Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage specification gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive and definitive hematopoietic progenitors, gfi1b is required for definitive hematopoiesis LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b GFI1 and GFI1B control the loss of endothelial identity of hemogenic endothelium during hematopoietic commitment  Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium A short Gfi-1B isoform controls erythroid differentiation Gfi-1B is a transcriptional repressor essential for the regulation of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis Among the few down-regulated genes was Gfi1b, a known repressor of erythroid differentiation This reversible modulation of endothelial-haematopoietic state is accomplished by targeting key haematopoietic transcription factors for downregulation, including Runx1, Gata1, Gfi1B, Ikaros, and PU.1 Gfi1 and Gfi1b: key regulators of hematopoiesis we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of these proteins. Gfi-1B controls human erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation by regulating TGF-beta signaling at the bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitor stage Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis We here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors To date, we have identified two common integration sites involving genes encoding transcription factors that play a critical role in hematopoiesis (Evi1 and Gfi1b loci) Transcription factors play essential roles in both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. This is the case for the growth factor independent 1b (GFI1B) transcription factor, which is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and over-expressed in leukemic patients and cell lines We localized several conserved non-coding elements containing multiple erythroid specific transcription factor binding sites at the GFI1B locus. In GFI1B-expressing cells a subset of these conserved non-coding elements and the promoter adopt a close spatial conformation, localize with open chromatin sites, harbor chromatin modifications associated with gene activation and bind multiple transcription factors and co-repressors Our findings indicate that GFI1B regulatory elements behave as activators and repressors To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B), a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages Our data indicate that Gfi-1B signalling is important for commitment and maturation of hematopoietic cell populations Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b are homologous transcriptional repressors involved in diverse developmental contexts, including hematopoiesis and oncogenesis Gfi1b:green fluorescent protein knock-in mice reveal a dynamic expression pattern of Gfi1b during hematopoiesis that is largely complementary to Gfi1 We found highly dynamic expression patterns of Gfi1b in erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and their progenitor cells (MEPS) where Gfi1 is not detected. Vice versa, Gfi1b could not be found in granulocytes, activated macrophages, or their granulomonocytic precursors (GMPs) or in mature naive or activated lymphocytes where Gfi1 is expressed, suggesting a complementary regulation of both loci during hematopoiesis Gfi1 and Gfi1b act equivalently in haematopoiesis our findings show that an intact SNAG domain is essential for all functions of Gfi1 and that Gfi1b can replace Gfi1 functionally in haematopoiesis Gfi-1 oncoproteins in hematopoiesis Recent gene targeting experiments and mutational screening in humans have revealed an essential role for Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis Gfi-1B disruption is embryonic lethal due to a block of erythropoiesis. Gfi-1B is required for both erythroid and megakaryocyte development Erythroid expansion mediated by the Gfi-1B zinc finger protein: role in normal hematopoiesis  we identified that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes These findings establish Gfi-1B as a novel erythroid regulator and reveal its specific involvement in the regulation of erythroid cell growth through modulating erythroid-specific gene expression The zinc-finger proto-oncogene Gfi-1b is essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages we establish that Gfi-1b is required for the development of two related blood lineages, erythroid and megakaryocytic, in mice Gfi-1b(-/-) embryonic stem cells fail to contribute to red cells of adult chimeras. Gfi-1b(-/-) embryos exhibit delayed maturation of primitive erythrocytes and subsequently die with failure to produce definitive enucleated erythrocytes Gfi-1b is an essential transcriptional regulator of erythroid and megakaryocyte development Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding repressor of transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis. Conversely, loss of gfi1b silences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for definitive hematopoiesis. Gfi1b:green fluorescent protein knock-in mice reveal a dynamic expression pattern of Gfi1b during hematopoiesis that is largely complementary to Gfi1. Gfi1 and Gfi1b: key regulators of hematopoiesis. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. Growth factor independence 1b (gfi1b) is important for the maturation of erythroid cells and the regulation of embryonic globin expression. Growth factor-independence 1b (Gfi1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. In fact, we demonstrate that VPA treatment is able to induce the expression of growth factor-independent protein 1B (GFI1B) and of mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to chromosome 3 protein (MLLT3), which are crucial regulators of erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation, and that the up-regulation of these genes is mediated by the histone hyperacetylation at their promoter sites.

Doesn't have single guide RNA been used on human cells?,no,"We used a library containing 73,000 sgRNAs to generate knockout collections and performed screens in two human cell lines. Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA). The type II CRISPR/Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes and its simplified derivative, the Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) system, have emerged as potent new tools for targeted gene knockout in bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish and human cells. Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA).  Using synthetic single RNA guides, Cas9 can be reprogrammed to create specific double-stranded DNA breaks in the genomes of a variety of organisms, ranging from human cells to bacteria, and thus constitutes a powerful tool for genetic engineering.

Are DNA helicases involved in progeroid syndromes?,yes,"Among these syndromes, relevant advances have recently been made in Werner syndrome, one of several progeroid syndromes characterized by defective DNA helicases, Progeroid syndromes (PSs) constitute a group of disorders characterized by clinical features mimicking physiological aging at an early age. However, all the characterized PSs enter in the field of rare monogenic disorders and several causative genes have been identified.

Isn't there association of matrix metalloproteinases with behaviour of pituitary adenomas?,no,"While detailed histological subtyping remains the best independent predictor of aggressive behavior in the majority of cases, evidence suggests that the additional analyses of FGFR4, MMP, PTTG, Ki-67, p53, and deletions in chromosome 11 may contribute to decisions concerning management of aggressive pituitary adenomas. We observed elevation of MMP-2 and -9 expression and consequent 3-D cell invasion in cells under-expressing RECK.   Based on the significance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for tumor growth and angiogenesis, we have studied the effect of batimastat (BB-94), a synthetic MMPs inhibitor (MMPI) on the progression of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma in rats.  Inhibition of estrogen-induced pituitary tumor growth and angiogenesis in Fischer 344 rats by the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat. The results of our study provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of batimastat, a synthetic MMPI, on the growth and angiogenesis in an experimental model of human prolactinoma. In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis. Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  We found no correlation of MMP-9 expression and tumour invasion. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes. CONCLUSIONS: TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasive pituitary adenomas to biological behavior. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-containing endopeptidases that are able to degrade the extracellular matrix and allow angiogenesis and tumor invasion.  MMP-9 expression did not differ between noninvasive tumors and normal pituitary gland, or between different sized prolactinomas. MMP-9 expression was related to aggressive tumor behavior. It was higher in invasive macroprolactinomas (P = 0.003) when compared with noninvasive macroprolactinomas or the normal anterior pituitary gland. In addition, although there was no difference in whether MMP-9 was present or not when nonfunctioning adenomas that recurred were compared with those that did not, samples of recurrent tumor at the second presentation were more likely to express MMP-9 (P = 0.01). Pituitary carcinomas were significantly more likely to be MMP-9 positive compared with normal anterior pituitary gland (P = 0.05), but there was no difference from invasive adenomas. Angiogenesis assessed by vascular density was related to MMP-9 expression (P<0.05). In summary, we have shown the presence of MMP-9 expression in some invasive and recurrent pituitary adenomas, and in the majority of pituitary carcinoma. The mechanisms whereby MMP-9 expression influences tumor recurrence and invasiveness, and its association with angiogenesis, remains to be elucidated.  Beside the digestion of the extracellular matrix during tumor invasion and metastasis, more recently, new functions for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been proposed.  CONCLUSION: No correlation could be established between the invasive potential of tumors and MMP-1, -2, and -3 expression levels.  Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.  We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0.039) or the expression of VEGF (P &lt; 0.001) and MMP-9 (P &lt; 0.001). But c-myc LI and bcl-2 expression have no association with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas (P = 0.061 vs. nm23 and MMP-9 have associations with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas, Matrix metalloproteinase secreted by pituitary cells can release growth factors from the extracellular matrix that, in turn, control pituitary cell proliferation and hormone secretion. In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis. There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0.039) or the expression of VEGF (P &lt; 0.001) and MMP-9 (P &lt; 0.001). Although our study has shown that MVD and the expression of VEGF, Ki-67, nm23 and MMP-9 have associations with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas, they are lack of specificity."
Is Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women associated with gestational diabetes?,yes,"Insufficient serum levels of 25-OHD were associated with gestational diabetes (pooled odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.89 Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, p Therefore, it is important to identify potentially modifiable risk factors for GDM. Accumulating evidence links vitamin D deficiency with abnormal glucose metabolism, and epidemiological studies have shown that women who develop GDM are more likely to be vitamin D deficient This review discusses the prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of GDM and vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women, outlines the possible mechanism of action of vitamin D in glucose homeostasis, and summarizes emerging evidence that associates vitamin D deficiency with the risk of developing GDM Women with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level less than 50 nmol/l in pregnancy experienced an increased risk of preeclampsia [OR 2.09 (95%CI 1.50 -2.90)], gestational diabetes mellitus [OR1.38 (1.12-1.70)] Low maternal vitamin D levels in pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, Association between vitamin D insufficiency and the risk for gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant Chinese women 25OHD insufficiency is very common in Chinese women. Low 25OHD status may be associated with insulin resistance and act as a risk factor for GDM. Second-trimester 25(OH)D levels were associated inversely with glucose levels after 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge test; low 25(OH)D levels may be associated with increased risk of GDM. Two hundred sixty-six women were screened. Vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D <20 ng/mL) was observed in 157 women (59%). We observed an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D levels and hemoglobin A1c, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, serum insulin, and fasting and 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test glucose levels Lower 25(OH)D levels are associated with disorders of glucose homeostasis and adverse obstetric and newborn outcomes. An association between mid-gestational 25-hydroxy vitamin D and fasting glucose was confirmed in a largely normoglycaemic and vitamin D-replete pregnant population. The correlation between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and β-cell function suggests that vitamin D may influence glucose metabolism through this mechanism. Women with gestational diabetes had significantly lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared with control subjects (56.3 vs. 62.0 nmol/l, P = 0.018). After adjusting for gestational age and maternal weight, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D below the top quartile (< 73.5 nmol/l) was associated with a twofold greater likelihood of gestational diabetes (adjusted odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.19-4.13). CONCLUSIONS: Lower vitamin D status in early pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent gestational diabetes that was independent of race, age, season and maternal weight. This study suggests that vitamin D may influence glucose tolerance during pregnancy Vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women is frequent in many populations over the world. It is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and caesarean section Consequences in newborns are low birth weight, neonatal rickets, a risk of neonatal hypocalcemia, asthma and/or type 1 diabetes. A single injection of 300,000 IU of vitamin D3 achieves a 3-month serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D range of 50-80 nmol/l and is an efficient, effective and safe procedure for improving the vitamin status and indices of insulin resistance in mothers with gestational diabetes after delivery. In a cohort of pregnant women with mostly sufficient levels of serum 25(OH)D, vitamin D deficiency was not associated with GDM. The aim of the study is evaluating the associations of FokI vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and its relations with postpartum metabolic syndrome. Our results indicate a meaningful association between FokI VDR genotypes and an increase risk of GDM in Iranian population as well as its effects on postpartum metabolic syndrome. The first-trimester maternal serum level of 25(OH)D is not altered in women with type 2 diabetes, those who develop GDM or those who deliver LGA neonates. Lower 25(OH)D levels are independently associated with poorer glycaemic control. Future randomised trials are needed to determine whether vitamin D plays a role in glycaemic control in GDM. These results suggested that rates of vitamin D deficiency are higher among women with IGT/GDM, and the relationship between vitamin D status and glucose tolerance in pregnancy needs further study. It appears that vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy is potentially associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, insulin resistance and gestational diabetes mellitus Mean serum 25OHD concentration was 53.8 +/- 23.9 nmol/l (sd). Ln-25OHD was negatively correlated with serum parathyroid hormone as expected (r -0.24, confidence intervals -0.35 to -0.12). Ln-25OHD was also negatively correlated with fasting plasma glucose (r-0.20, -0.31 to -0.08), fasting insulin (r -0.20, -0.31 to -0.08) and insulin resistance as calculated by homeostasis model assessment (r -0.21, -0.32 to -0.09). The association between fasting glucose and log-transformed 25OHD concentration was of borderline significance after accounting for ethnicity, age and body mass index in multivariate analyses (-0.13, -0.26 to 0.01). The odds ratio of gestational diabetes in women with 25OHD < 50 nmol/l did not reach statistical significance (1.92, 95% confidence interval 0.89-4.17). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal 25OHD concentrations are inversely related to fasting glucose, although further studies are required to establish whether this is independent of the effects of ethnic background. Vitamin D insufficiency is common in Indian mothers but is not associated with gestational diabetes or variation in newborn size. There was no association between maternal 25(OH)D and gestational diabetes (incidence 7% in women with and without hypovitaminosis D) In mothers with hypovitaminosis D, higher 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with lower 30-min glucose concentrations (P=0.03) and higher fasting proinsulin concentrations (P=0.04) Hypovitaminosis D at 30 weeks gestation is common in Mysore mothers. It is not associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, Total prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) was found in 70.6% of pregnant women. Prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency (<12.5) in GDM patients was higher than in normoglycaemic pregnancies. These results show that a positive correlation of 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations with insulin sensitivity and vitamin D deficiency could be a confirmative sign of insulin resistance. was to examine whether maternal dietary intake of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and omega-6 fatty acids during pregnancy is associated with the appearance of islet autoimmunity (IA) in offspring Maternal intake of vitamin D via food was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IA appearance in offspring, independent of HLA genotype, family history of type 1 diabetes, presence of gestational diabetes mellitus, and ethnicity (adjusted HR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.78). Vitamin D intake via supplements, omega-3 fatty acids, and omega-6 fatty acids intake during pregnancy were not associated with appearance of IA in offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that maternal intake of vitamin D through food during pregnancy may have a protective effect on the appearance of IA in offspring."

Doesn't splicing occur co-transcriptionally?,no,"Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and mammalian cells - have shown that pre-mRNA can be spliced during the process of transcription (i.e. co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription termination (i.e. post-transcriptionally) The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues. Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs.  The majority of introns in higher eukaryotes are excised prior to transcript release in a manner that is dependent on transcription through pol II s a result of co-transcriptional splicing, variations in pol II elongation influence alternative splicing patterns, wherein a slower elongation rate is associated with increased inclusion of alternative exons within mature mRNA.  We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing Modelling reveals co-transcriptional splicing to be the most probable and most efficient splicing pathway for the reporter transcripts, due in part to a positive feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional second step splicing RNA processing events that take place on the transcribed pre-mRNA include capping, splicing, editing, 3' processing, and polyadenylation. Most of these processes occur co-transcriptionally while the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme is engaged in transcriptional elongation Abundant evidence indicates that splicing to excise introns occurs co-transcriptionally, prior to release of the nascent transcript from RNAP II Together, our work establishes a system for co-transcriptional splicing in vitro, in which the spliceosome containing the 5' and 3' exons are tethered to RNAP II for splicing. Co-transcriptional splicing of constitutive and alternative exons Current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during RNA synthesis Thus, we demonstrate that the decision to include or skip an alternative exon is made during transcription and not post-transcriptionally Here, we demonstrated that the co-transcriptional splicing of the intron in vitro was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the P3-P7 core of the intron RNA editing and alternative splicing: the importance of co-transcriptional coordination Co-transcriptional splicing of pre-messenger RNAs: considerations for the mechanism of alternative splicing The realization that splicing occurs co-transcriptionally requires two important considerations"
Aren't there clinical trials on stem cells in multiple sclerosis,no,"Cells are generally given intravenously. Multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have been successfully treated in human clinical trials Human multipotent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies are currently being tested in clinical trials for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease, type 1 diabetes, bone fractures, cartilage damage, and cardiac diseases. Based on these results, several small pilot clinical trials in subjects with advanced MS have demonstrated that MSC administration is safe and provided an early signal of clinical effectiveness. The current aim of clinicians and scientists interested in the development of MSC-based strategies for the treatment of MS is to have the ultimate demonstration in large clinical trials that MSC can inhibit CNS inflammation and foster tissue repair Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) promote functional recovery in experimental models of central nervous system (CNS) pathology and are currently being tested in clinical trials for stroke, multiple sclerosis and CNS injury. Autologous bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) offer significant practical advantages for potential clinical applications in multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on recent experimental data, a number of clinical trials have been designed for the intravenous (IV) and/or intrathecal (ITH) administration of BMSCs in MS patients. Fingolimod is a S1P receptor modulator in MS clinical trials due to systemic anti-inflammatory properties, yet may impact cells within the CNS by crossing the blood-brain barrier. Their development in vitro and their use in vivo in animal models of degenerative neurological disease and recent first efforts in human clinical trials were the topics of a recent international meeting sponsored by the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society on ""Stem Cells & MS: Prospects and Strategies"" Here we discuss key observations and questions emerging from clinical trials of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for MS Another possibility to achieve remyelination is the transplantation of myelinating cells into the central nervous system. Proof of principle and demonstration of the functionality were shown in numerous experiments, and a first clinical trial in patients with MS has started This first trial will show if cell transplantation is a feasible concept in MS and whether the transplanted cells will survive and form new myelin."
Aren't piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,no,"In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here we show that the CG9754 protein is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 to nascent messenger RNA transcripts causes cotranscriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We have named CG9754 ""Panoramix,"" and we propose that this protein could act as an adaptor, scaffolding interactions between the piRNA pathway and the general silencing machinery that it recruits to enforce transcriptional repression. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. Thus, by reanimating RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA silencing. In different organisms, small RNAs were shown to be implicated in the posttranscriptional degradation of mRNA and/or transcriptional repression of the homologous locus. In Drosophila, the mechanism of piRNA-mediated silencing is still far from being understood Analyses of piRNA-mediated transcriptional transposon silencing in Drosophila Transcriptional silencing implies a piRNA-mediated formation of repressive chromatin which diminishes the transcriptional capacity of the target locus. In mice, piRNA-guided transposon repression correlates with establishment of CpG DNA methylation on their sequences, yet the mechanism and the spectrum of genomic targets of piRNA silencing are unknown Using a candidate gene KD-approach, we identified differences in the spatio-temporal requirements of the piRNA pathway components for piRNA-mediated silencing. Spatio-temporal requirements for transposable element piRNA-mediated silencing during Drosophila oogenesis In contrast, piRNA-mediated silencing is strong in germline stem cells in which TE mobilization is tightly repressed ensuring the continued production of viable germline cysts. Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. In germ cells, early embryos, and stem cells of animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have an important role in silencing retrotransposons, which are vicious genomic parasites, through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons.  Our observations confirm the pivotal role of piRNA-mediated silencing in defending the genome against selfish transposition, yet also suggest limits to the optimization of host genome defense. Analysis of piRNA-mediated silencing of active TEs in Drosophila melanogaster suggests limits on the evolution of host genome defense The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway defends animal genomes against the harmful consequences of transposable element (TE) infection by imposing small-RNA-mediated silencing. A novel organelle, the piNG-body, in the nuage of Drosophila male germ cells is associated with piRNA-mediated gene silencing. Proteins of the PIWI subfamily Aub and AGO3 associated with the germline-specific perinuclear granules (nuage) are involved in the silencing of retrotransposons and other selfish repetitive elements in the Drosophila genome.  Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the targets of piRNA-mediated silencing Mechanism of the piRNA-mediated silencing of Drosophila telomeric retrotransposons. Gene silencing mechanisms mediated by Aubergine piRNA complexes in Drosophila male gonad. The epigenetic trans-silencing effect in Drosophila involves maternally-transmitted small RNAs whose production depends on the piRNA pathway and HP1. Here, we show that mutations in squash and zucchini, which are involved in the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) silencing pathway, strongly affect TSE MVH in piRNA processing and gene silencing of retrotransposons piRNA-mediated silencing in Drosophila germlines. These have shed light not only on the molecular mechanisms of gene silencing mediated by piRNAs and PIWI proteins, but also on their intriguing relationship with cellular genes that have been shown to be important for gametogenesis and fertility. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene silencing To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation PIWI-interacting small non-coding RNAs (piRNAs) are genetic and epigenetic regulatory factors in germline cells, where they maintain genome stability, are involved in RNA silencing and regulate gene expression The piNG-body contains ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in piRNA-silencing of genome repeats including transposons in premeiotic spermatocytes with aid of short piRNAs Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons Recent studies have revealed not only the biogenesis of piRNAs and their roles in transposon silencing, but also the function of the Piwi-piRNA pathway in epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression A growing number of studies on piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA biogenesis These have shed light not only on the molecular mechanisms of gene silencing mediated by piRNAs and PIWI proteins, but also on their intriguing relationship with cellular genes that have been shown to be important for gametogenesis and fertility Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the targets of piRNA-mediated silencing.  MVH in piRNA processing and gene silencing of retrotransposons. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation.  Therefore piRNA-mediated transcriptional mode of silencing is involved in the control of retrotransposon expression in the Drosophila germline. Panoramix enforces piRNA-dependent cotranscriptional silencing. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene silencing. Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation."
Isn't miR-21 related to carcinogenesis?,no,"miR-21* and miR-203 were significantly dysregulated (P < 0.05) in PTC tissues with BRAFV600E. Expressions of miRNAs in papillary thyroid carcinoma and their associations with the BRAFV600E mutation. Levels of miRNA-21 (miR-21) and miR-106a in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher compared with the levels in adjacent tissues (P = .006 and P = .001, respectively). Patients who had gastric cancer had significantly different levels of gastric juice miR-21 and miR-106a compared with patients who had benign gastric diseases (both P < .001). miR-21 levels in intestinal type gastric cancer specimens were higher than that in diffuse (P = .003) or mixed (P < .001) gastric cancer types. MiR-155 and miR-21 appeared significantly over-expressed in the colonic mucosa of IBD subjects without CRC, but also in neoplastic tissues of IBD patients compared to non-IBD controls (p<0.001). Importantly, in patients with IBD-CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 over-expression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (p<0.001). Here we hypothesize that over-expression of miR-155 and miR-21, two inflammation-related miRNAs that target core MMR proteins, may constitute a pre-neoplastic event for the development of MSI IBD-CRCs. After administration, we determined the expressions of miR-21, miR-27a, miR-34a, miR-93, miR-143, miR-146a, miR-148a, miR-155, miR-196a, miR-203, miR-205, miR-221 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells-1 (Nfκb1), mitogen-activated protein kinase-8 (Mapk8) and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras) genes in the liver of mice. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a tumor suppressor gene whose expression is controlled by miR-21. Consistently with PDCD4 downregulation, miR-21 was upregulated in neoplastic by comparison with nonneoplastic tissue samples. Expression of miR-21 (p=0.027), miR-181b (p=0.002), and miR-146b (p=0.021) in tumor tissue and miR-21 (p=0.003) in noncancerous tissue were associated with patients' overall survival. We analyzed the expression of nine miRNAs (miR-21, miR-127, miR-154, miR-224, miR-323, miR-370, miR-9*, miR-183, and miR-375) by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction in 34 cases of sMTC, 6 cases of hMTC, and 2 cases of C-cell hyperplasia (CCH). MTC and CCH were both characterized by a significant overexpression of the whole set of miRNAs (the increase being 4.2-fold for miR-21, 6.7-fold for miR-127, 8.8-fold for miR-154, 6.6-fold for miR-224, 5.8-fold for miR-323, 6.1-fold for miR-370, 13-fold for miR-9*, 6.7-fold for miR-183, and 10.1 for miR-375, p<0.0001). The most frequent changes in miRNAs in CLL cells included downregulation of miR-126, miR-572, miR-494, miR-923, miR-638, miR-130a, miR-181a and miR-181b and up-regulation of miR-29a, miR-660, miR-20a, miR-106b, miR-142-5p, miR-101, miR-30b, miR-34a, miR-let-7f, miR-21 and miR-155. Results: MTC and CCH were both characterized by a significant overexpression of the whole set of miRNAs (the increase being 4.2-fold for miR-21, 6.7-fold for miR-127, 8.8-fold for miR-154, 6.6-fold for miR-224, 5.8-fold for miR-323 and 6.1-fold for miR-370, 13-fold for miR-9*, 6.7-fold for miR-183 and 10.1 for miR-375, p<0.0001). We found that the onco-miRNAs miR-21 and miR-221 displayed upregulated expression while the liver-specific miR-122 was downregulated. The aim of the present review was to describe the mechanisms of several known miR, summarize recent studies on oncogenic miR (e.g. miR-21, miR-106a and miR-17), tumor suppressor miR (e.g. miR-101, miR-181, miR-449, miR-486, let-7a) and controversial roles of miR (e.g. miR-107, miR-126) for gastric cancer. MiR-15b and miR-21 were differentially expressed in CSF samples from patients with gliomas, compared to control subjects with various neurologic disorders, including patients with primary CNS lymphoma and carcinomatous brain metastases. Moreover, inclusion of miR-15b and miR-21 in combined expression analyses resulted in an increased diagnostic accuracy with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity to distinguish patients with glioma from control subjects and patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Many aberrantly expressed miRNAs were related to various cancers (e.g., miR-125b, hepatocellular carcinoma; miR-21, leukemia; miR-16, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; miR-192, pituitary adenomas; miR-199a-3p, ovarian cancer; miR-34a, pancreatic cancer). Several miRNAs (e.g., miR-34a, miR-21) and proteins (e.g., TGM2, NDRG2) that play crucial roles in liver tumorigenesis were first found to be affected by MC-LR in mouse liver. Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. In addition, diet and carcinogen exposure modulated a number of microRNAs (miR-16, miR-19b, miR-21, miR26b, miR27b, miR-93, and miR-203) linked to canonical oncogenic signaling pathways. RESULTS: Elevated miR-21 (HR 2.06, 1.13-3.75), miR-17 (HR 2.00, 1.10-3.61), and miR-155 (HR 2.37, 1.27-4.42) was associated with worse cancer-specific mortality in the Maryland cohort. NF-κB targets miR-16 and miR-21 in gastric cancer: involvement of prostaglandin E receptors. Expression of miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155, and let-7a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 639 IALT patients. hese two miRNAs have previously been identified as being overexpressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with miR-21 specifically implicated in down-regulating the tumor suppressor gene, tropomyosin-1. MicroRNA-21 is involved in ionizing radiation-promoted liver carcinogenesis. We showed here that among several hundred miRNAs, miR-21 was the only one that increased 6 folds in high-LET IR-promoted mouse liver tumors when compared with that in the non-irradiated liver tissues. We also showed that miR-21 was up-regulated in human or mouse hepatocytes after exposure to IR, as well as in liver tissues derived from whole body irradiated mice. After the non-irradiated, low-LET or high-LET irradiated human hepatocytes were over-expressed with miR-21, these cells became tumorigenesis in nude mice. METHODS: We used this combined ISH/IHC assay to study a subset of cancer-associated miRNAs, including miRNAs frequently detected at low (miR-34a and miR-126) and high (miR-21 and miR-155) levels, in a panel of breast, colorectal, lung, pancreas, and prostate carcinomas. The miR-15a, miR-16, miR-143, miR-155, and miR-21 were upregulated in M059K, and the modulation of these miRNAs fluctuated in M059J cells in a time-dependent manner. Aberrantly increased expression of miR-21 plays a significant role in lung carcinogenesis and is a potential therapeutic target in both epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant and wild-type cases. Additionally, high miR-21 expression was associated with significantly decreased 5 year survival in patients (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% CI: 1.04-2.77) in a model controlled for patient age, gender and tumor stage. ESULTS: In adenocarcinoma patients, miR-21, miR-223, miR-192, and miR-194 expression was elevated, whereas miR-203 expression was reduced in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. Significantly, elevated miR-21 expression in noncancerous tissue of SCC patients and reduced levels of miR-375 in cancerous tissue of adenocarcinoma patients with Barrett's were strongly associated with worse prognosis. miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were consistently upregulated, whereas miR-1 and miR-143 were downregulated in lung tumors relative to normal lungs. In mice treated with VC and given I3C in the diet, levels of miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were reduced relative to the level in mice treated with the carcinogen only. Further studies with miR-21 indicated that phosphatase and tensin homolog, programmed cell death 4 and rich protein with Kazal motifs are potential targets for the oncogenic effect of miR-21 and the chemopreventive activity of I3C. This study examines the potential clinical utility of an inflammatory gene expression signature as a prognostic biomarker for colon cancer in addition to previously examined miR-21 expression. CONCLUSIONS: IRS and miR-21 expression are independent predictors of colon cancer prognosis and may provide a clinically useful tool to identify high-risk patients. The most highly expressed miRNAs in gastric cancer tissues were miR-20b, miR-20a, miR-17, miR-106a, miR-18a, miR-21, miR-106b, miR-18b, miR-421, miR-340*, miR-19a and miR-658. Recent findings report their involvement in hair follicle morphogenesis (ablation of miRNAs from keratinocytes causes several defects, such as evagination instead of invagination), in psoriasis (skin-specific expression of miR-203 and psoriasisspecific expression of miR-146a, miR-21 and miR-125b in the skin), in autoimmune diseases affecting the skin, such as SLE and ITP, in wound healing (changes in the expression of specific miRNA at specific phases of the regeneration process), and in skin carcinogenesis (a novel miRNA signature that includes induction of miR-21, a candidate oncogenic miRNA). RESULTS: Several microRNAs were differentially expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovarian tissues, including miR-21, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-100, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-99a, which were each differentially expressed in >16 patients. Selected for validation were miR-20a, miR-21, miR-106a, miR-181b, and miR-203, and all 5 were enriched in tumors from the validation cohort (P < .001). Higher miR-21 expression was present in adenomas (P = .006) and in tumors with more advanced TNM staging (P < .001). In situ hybridization demonstrated miR-21 to be expressed at high levels in colonic carcinoma cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied the pharmacologic roles of three microRNAs previously implicated in cancer biology (let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21) and also used in silico methods to test pharmacologic microRNA effects more broadly. Changing the cellular levels of let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21 affected the potencies of a number of the anticancer agents by up to 4-fold. The effect was most prominent with mir-21, with 10 of 28 cell-compound pairs showing significant shifts in growth-inhibitory activity. Varying mir-21 levels changed potencies in opposite directions depending on compound class; indicating that different mechanisms determine toxic and protective effects. In silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Conversely, expression of other miRNAs was detected at varying levels predominantly within luminal epithelial cells in normal tissue; expression of miR-21 was frequently increased, whereas that of let-7a was decreased in malignant cells. We describe a novel EMT-specific microRNA signature that includes induction of miR-21, a candidate oncogenic microRNA associated with carcinogenesis. Notable was the high expression of miR-21 and miR-205. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key actors in carcinogenesis and we demonstrated that microRNA-21 (miR-21), oncomiR is expressed early during PDA. These results indicated that miR-21 plays a role in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of O. viverrini-associated CCA by suppressing the function of PDCD4. Importantly, in patients with IBD CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 overexpression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (P < 0.001). Ectopic overexpression of miR-21 promoted Akt activation and phosphorylation of EZH2, whereas inhibiting miR-21 by transfecting the cells with anti-miR-21 inhibited Akt activation and EZH2 phosphorylation. PDCD4 nuclear down-regulation (which parallels miR-21 up-regulation) is involved in the molecular pathway of IBD-associated carcinogenesis. The expression levels of miR-21 (p = 0.027), miR-181b (p = 0.002) and miR-146b (p = 0.021) in tumor tissue and miR-21 (p = 0.003) in noncancerous tissue were associated with overall survival of patients. OBJECTIVE: As an important oncogenic miRNA, miR-21 has been reported to play crucial roles in glioblastoma (GBM) carcinogenesis. We further analyzed the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21), an oncogenic noncoding RNA involved in oncogenic Ras signaling, by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) plays crucial roles in carcinogenesis and is considered as one of the most studied oncomiRNAs. Although microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis, its functions and molecular mechanisms in carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis are unclear. Substantial evidence indicates that microRNA-21 (miR-21) is a key oncomiR in carcinogenesis and is significantly elevated in multiple myeloma (MM). MicroRNA 21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis. Conversely, pAkt and miR-21 expression was significantly up-regulated in the whole spectrum of preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions considered. Several miRNAs (e.g., miR-34a, miR-21) and proteins (e.g., TGM2, NDRG2) that play crucial roles in liver tumorigenesis were first found to be affected by MC-LR in mouse liver. RESULTS: Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. MicroRNA 21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in virtually all types of carcinomas and various types of hematological malignancies. As expected, miR-21 expression was significantly upregulated in preneoplastic/neoplastic samples, consistent with PDCD4 downregulation. Furthermore, miR-21 levels in the primary tumours correlated with disease stage (P < 0.0001). We found that miR-16 and miR-21 were upregulated upon nicotine stimulation, transfection with anti-miR-16 or anti-miR-21 significantly abrogated cell proliferation. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a unique miRNA in that it is overexpressed in most tumour types analysed so far. Although altered expressions of miR-21 and miR-34a were manifested within cancer cells, those of miR-126 and miR-155 were predominantly confined to endothelial cells and immune cells, respectively. However, the function of miR-21 in osteosarcoma is still unclear. In SCC patients, we found elevated miR-21 and reduced miR-375 expression levels in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were consistently upregulated, whereas miR-1 and miR-143 were downregulated in lung tumors relative to normal lungs. Precancerous adenomas also frequently showed miR-21 up-regulation. Higher miR-21 expression was present in adenomas (P = .006) Importantly, the inflammatory ZD esophagus had a distinct microRNA signature resembling human ESCC or tongue SCC miRNAomes with miR-31 and miR-21 as the top-up-regulated species. Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some upregulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells. OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is one of the miRNAs that are frequently and highly overexpressed in tumor tissue of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients; however, only a little is known about its functional role in CRC. Inhibition of microRNA-21 (mir‑21) induced upregulation of Spry2             and PTEN which underscores the importance of mir-21 in Spry2-associated tumorigenesis             of the colon. The microRNA miR-21, a known oncogenic miRNA, was found to be upregulated in papillary and clear cell carcinomas. Since microRNA-21 (miR-21) may contribute to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in many cancer types, we aimed to investigate its efficacy in TCCs. Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some up-regulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells. In this study, by using high-throughput microRNA profiling, we identified that two miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-148a) overexpressed in CD4+ T cells from both patients with lupus and lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, which promote cell hypomethylation by repressing DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. The microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been identified as the only miRNA overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including leukemia. OBJECTIVE: The contribution of overexpressed microRNA-21 and -221 (miR-21 and miR-221) to the malignant phenotype was determined by inhibiting these miRNAs using antisense oligonucleotides. The microRNA-21(miR-21) has been identified as the only miRNA over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers, including cervical cancer. To determine the functions of these microRNAs in lymphomagenesis, we examined the effects of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting miR-21 (ASO-21) and/or miR-155 (ASO-155) in NK-cell lymphoma lines overexpressing one or both of these miRNAs. In this study, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of 28 cases of never-smoker lung cancer identified aberrantly expressed miRNAs, which were much fewer than in lung cancers of smokers and included miRNAs previously identified (e.g., up-regulated miR-21) and unidentified (e.g., down-regulated miR-138) in those smoker cases. The oncogenic miRNA, microRNA-21 (miR-21), was found to be upregulated in laryngeal carcinoma tissues. OBJECTIVE: To better understand microRNA miR-21 function in carcinogenesis, we analyzed miR-21 expression patterns in different stages of colorectal cancer development using in situ hybridization (ISH). Of these miRNAs, miR-21 appears to be important in tumorigenesis given its up-regulation in almost all types of human cancer examined. The microRNA-21 gene (mir-21) has been identified as the only miRNA commonly overexpressed in solid tumors of the lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, brain, head and neck, esophagus and pancreas. RESULTS: Our data showed that a common pattern of microRNA expression distinguishes any tumor type from normal pancreas, suggesting that this set of microRNAs might be involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis; the expression of miR-103 and miR-107, associated with lack of expression of miR-155, discriminates tumors from normal; a set of 10 microRNAs distinguishes endocrine from acinar tumors and is possibly associated with either normal endocrine differentiation or endocrine tumorigenesis; miR-204 is primarily expressed in insulinomas and correlates with immunohistochemical expression of insulin; and the overexpression of miR-21 is strongly associated with both a high Ki67 proliferation index and presence of liver metastasis. To search for tumor-associated mutations that could affect processing and expression of mature miRNAs, a panel of 91 cancer-derived cell lines was analyzed for sequence variations in 15 miRNAs implicated in tumorigenesis by virtue of their known target transcripts (let-7 family targeting oncogenic Ras) or their localization to sites of frequent chromosomal instability (miR-143, miR-145, miR-26a-1, and miR-21)."

Is PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in Parkinson disease?,yes,"An increase in α-synuclein levels due to gene duplications/triplications or impaired degradation is sufficient to trigger its aggregation and cause familial Parkinson disease  Here, we report that Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), an enzyme up-regulated in synucleinopathy-diseased brains, interacts with, phosphorylates and enhances α-synuclein autophagic degradation in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Polo-like kinase 2 regulates selective autophagic α-synuclein clearance and suppresses its toxicity in vivo Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PLK2 is a previously undescribed regulator of α-synuclein turnover and that modulating its kinase activity could be a viable target for the treatment of synucleinopathies.  α-Synuclein increased PLK2 levels and GSK-3β activity and increased the levels of phosphorylated α-Synuclein and Tau Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system Several neurological diseases, including Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, are characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser-129 (p-Ser-129) Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons. PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay These results indicate that PLK2 plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in central nervous system."

Don't DNA double-strand breaks play a causal role in carcinogenesis?,no,"The DNA non-homologous end-joining repair gene XRCC6/Ku70 plays an important role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by both exogenous and endogenous DNA-damaging agents. Defects in overall DSB repair capacity can lead to genomic instability and carcinogenesis. The tumor suppressor breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) protects our cells from genomic instability in part by facilitating the efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). BRCA1 promotes the error-free repair of DSBs through homologous recombination and is also implicated in the regulation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair fidelity. The increased frequency of DSB mutagenesis and MMEJ repair in the absence of BRCA1 suggests a potential mechanism for carcinogenesis. Comet assay under neutral conditions allows detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which has consequence to genome instability and carcinogenesis. Loss of p15/Ink4b accompanies tumorigenesis triggered by complex DNA double-strand breaks. Although DSBs are potentially carcinogenic, it is not clear whether complex DSBs that are refractory to repair are more potently tumorigenic compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly repaired, correctly or incorrectly, by mammalian cells. Zinc chromate induces chromosome instability and DNA double strand breaks in human lung cells. Our study shows that zinc chromate induced concentration-dependent increases in cytotoxicity, chromosome damage and DNA double strand breaks in human lung cells. Foci formation of P53-binding protein 1 in thyroid tumors: activation of genomic instability during thyroid carcinogenesis. Nitric oxide and acid induce double-strand DNA breaks in Barrett's esophagus carcinogenesis via distinct mechanisms. DNA double-strand break repair capacity and risk of breast cancer. A tumorigenic role of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been suggested by our finding of a significant association between increased breast cancer risk and a cooperative effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NHEJ genes. Carcinogen-induced DNA double strand break repair in sporadic breast cancer. Induction of DNA double strand breaks and alterations in the repair of these breaks is implicated in breast carcinogenesis. Prior studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from breast cancer patients exhibit increased numbers of DNA strand breaks after exposure to ionizing radiation, but these studies did not specifically measure DNA double strand breaks and it is not known whether chemical carcinogens produce similar effects. Abnormal DNA end-joining activity in human head and neck cancer. In human cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired primarily by the DNA end-joining (EJ) process and thus, abnormal DNA EJ activities lead to an accumulation of mutations and/or aneuploidy, resulting in genetic instability of cells. Since genetic instability is the hallmark of cancer cells, we studied the DNA EJ activities of normal, non-malignant immortalized and malignant human epithelial cells to investigate the association between DNA EJ and carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Recent research has shown that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer. In order to study the role of DNA damage processing in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we assessed the ability of six keratinocyte cell lines from a multistage-tumor progression model to repair three types of DNA damage: pyrimidine dimers, oxidative DNA lesions and DNA double strand breaks (DSB). However, an acquired deficiency in repairing DNA double strand breaks can be one mechanism promoting progression towards malignancy, possibly through impairing chromosomal stability. Recent findings demonstrate that accelerated carcinogenesis following liver regeneration is associated with chronic inflammation-induced double-strand DNA breaks in cells, which escaped apoptosis due to proliferative stress. Although DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis may relate to arsenite-induced damage and carcinogenesis, the mechanism of action remains obscure."
Do conserved noncoding elements co-occur with matrix-attachment regions?,yes,"We hypothesized that some of these regions might be matrix-scaffold attachment regions, MARs (or S/MARs). MARs comprise one of the few classes of eukaryotic noncoding DNA with an experimentally characterized function, being involved in the attachment of chromatin to the nuclear matrix, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the co-occurrence of predicted MARs with highly conserved noncoding DNA regions in human-mouse genomic alignments. We found that 11% of the conserved noncoding DNA consists of predicted MARs. Conversely, more than half of the predicted MARs co-occur with one or more independently identified conserved sequence blocks. An excess of conserved predicted MARs is seen in intergenic regions preceding 5' ends of genes, suggesting that these MARs are primarily involved in transcriptional control A significant fraction of conserved noncoding DNA in human and mouse consists of predicted matrix attachment regions. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the co-occurrence of predicted MARs with highly conserved noncoding DNA regions in human-mouse genomic alignments. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the co-occurrence of predicted MARs with highly conserved noncoding DNA regions in human-mouse genomic alignments"

Effect of the MDM2 antagonist RG7112 on the P53 pathway in patients with MDM2-amplified, well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma: an exploratory proof-of-mechanism study. RG7112 was selected for evaluation by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) due to the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations in pediatric cancers compared with adult malignancies.  Thus, inhibitors of p53-MDM2 binding that can reactivate p53 in cancer cells may offer an effective approach for cancer therapy. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell lines. A crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53 amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Notably, RG7112 was highly synergistic with androgen deprivation in LNCaP xenograft tumors. Our findings offer a preclinical proof-of-concept that RG7112 is effective in treatment of solid tumors expressing wild-type p53. RG7112 induced tumor regressions in solid tumors from different histotype panels, and exhibited consistent high-level activity against ALL xenografts. This high level of activity supports prioritization of RG7112 for further evaluation.

Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling ?,yes,"Thyroid hormones exert important effects on heart remodeling through mir-208. RV and RA function and mechanics are significantly affected by SHT. l-T4 therapy and 1-year maintenance of euthyroid status improved but did not completely recover RV and RA function and deformation in the SHT patients, which implies that right heart remodeling caused by SHT is not reversible in a 1-year period. These results suggest that long-term T4 treatment after MI has beneficial effects on myocyte, arteriolar, and collagen matrix remodeling in the non-infarcted area. Most importantly, results suggest improved survival of myocytes in the peri-infarct area."
Isn't armodafinil used for treatment of insomnia?,yes,"Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness. Other treatment options may include pharmacologic interventions such as modafinil and armodafinil, which have shown efficacy in this population. BACKGROUND: Armodafinil (Nuvigil(®), Cephalon, Inc., Frazer, PA, USA), the longer-lasting isomer of racemic modafinil, is a nonamphetamine, wakefulness-promoting medication. In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder, treated obstructive sleep apnoea, or narcolepsy, armodafinil has been found to improve wakefulness throughout the shift or day. In addition, while not approved for this indication, armodafinil has been found to improve excessive sleepiness associated with jet-lag disorder. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting medication. Its efficacy and tolerability have been established in 12-week studies of patients with excessive sleepiness (ES) associated with treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), shift work disorder (SWD), or narcolepsy.  Armodafinil represents an option for long-term treatment of patients with ES associated with treated OSA, SWD, or narcolepsy. The wakefulness-promoting agents armodafinil and modafinil are FDA approved for the treatment of ES in patients with SWD. CONCLUSIONS: Armodafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition related to excessive sleepiness as rated by the CGI-C and was well tolerated in patients with treated OSA and comorbid depression. CONCLUSION: In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with chronic SWD of moderate or greater severity, armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness during scheduled night work, raising mean nighttime sleep latency above the level considered to indicate severe sleepiness during the daytime. Armodafinil also significantly improved measures of overall clinical condition, long-term memory, and attention.  Adjunct treatment with armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness, long-term memory, and patients' ability to engage in activities of daily living in nCPAP-adherent individuals with ES associated with OSA.  A number of studies have evaluated countermeasures or interventions in shift workers; proposed treatments include chronobiotic interventions, such as light exposure, melatonin, hypnotic agents, caffeine and CNS stimulants (amphetamine), and the wake-promoting agents modafinil and armodafinil.  These studies showed that modafinil and armodafinil significantly improve the ability to sustain wakefulness during waking activities (e.g. working, driving), overall clinical condition, and sustained attention or memory in patients with SWSD.  CONCLUSIONS: In this selected population of patients with OSA/HS and residual ES despite effective treatment with nCPAP, armodafinil QD used as an adjunct to nCPAP treatment was associated with improved wakefulness and overall clinical condition.   Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness.

Are there currently applications of deep learning in genomics?,yes,"Deep learning of the tissue-regulated splicing code. Using a deep neural network, we developed a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data that can predict splicing patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues. Our architecture uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genomic sequences and tissue types when making predictions. A graphics processing unit was used to greatly reduce the training time of our models with millions of parameters. We show that the deep architecture surpasses the performance of the previous Bayesian method for predicting AS patterns. With the proper optimization procedure and selection of hyperparameters, we demonstrate that deep architectures can be beneficial, even with a moderately sparse dataset. An analysis of what the model has learned in terms of the genomic features is presented. Machine learning applications in genetics and genomics"
Aren't CpG islands located close to housekeeping genes?,no,"our analysis indicates that the association of CGIs with housekeeping genes is not as strong as previously estimated CpG islands are preferentially located at the start of transcription of housekeeping genes and are associated with tissue-specific genes It has been envisaged that CpG islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of housekeeping genes. These regions represent about 1% of genomic DNA and are generally found in the promoter region of housekeeping genes. CpG islands are stretches of DNA sequence that are enriched in the (CpG)n repeat and are present in close association with all housekeeping genes as well as some tissue-specific genes in the mammalian genome. CpG islands, which are found almost exclusively at the 5'-end of housekeeping genes In housekeeping and many tissue-specific genes, the promoter is embedded in a so-called CpG island. All housekeeping and widely expressed genes have a CpG island covering the transcription start, whereas 40% of the genes with a tissue-specific or limited expression are associated with islands Methylation-free CpG clusters, so-called HTF islands, are most often associated with the promoter regions of housekeeping genes, whereas genes expressed in a single-cell type are usually deficient in these sequences. Unmethylated CpG rich islands are a feature of vertebrate DNA: they are associated with housekeeping and many tissue specific genes. CpG islands were associated with the 5' ends of all housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3' ends of some tissue-specific genes."
Have microRNAs been implicated in pharmacogenomics?,yes,"A major discovery is the ability of miRNAs to determine the efficacy of drugs, which has given rise to the field of 'miRNA pharmacogenomics' through 'Pharmaco-miRs'. miRNAs play a significant role in pharmacogenomics by down-regulating genes that are important for drug function. The potential modulation of toxicology-related changes in miRNA expression, the role of miRNA in immune-mediated drug-induced liver injuries, the use of circulating miRNAs in body fluids as potential toxicological biomarkers, and the link between miRNA-related pharmacogenomics and adverse drug reactions are highlighted. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miRNA target sequences may affect or impair the binding of miRNAs. Studies have shown that SNPs in miRNA target sites (miR-TS-SNPs) have a great influence on diverse biological functions, including pharmacogenomics and disease susceptibilities in human. Pharmacogenomics genes can be divided into drug target genes termed as pharmacodynamics genes (PD) and genes involved in drug transport and metabolism termed as pharmacokinetics genes (PK). To clarify the regulatory potential of miRNAs in pharmacogenomics, we have examined the potential regulation by miRNAs of PK and PD genes. Our analysis identify a striking difference in the level of miRNA regulation between PK and PD genes, with the former having less than half predicted conserved miRNA binding sites compared with the latter. Importantly, this finding is reflected in a highly significant difference in the shift in expression levels of PD versus PK genes after depletion of miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes an intrinsic difference between PK and PD genes and helps clarify the role of miRNAs in pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and small RNA expression analysis are three of the most active research topics in the biological, biomedical, pharmaceutical, and toxicological fields. All of these studies are based on gene expression analysis, which requires reference genes to reduce the variations derived from different amounts of starting materials and different efficiencies of RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. In contrast, hTBCA and small RNAs are more stable during drug treatment, and they are better reference genes for pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics studies. Polymorphisms of genes involved in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes underlie the divergent drug responses among individuals. A panel of drug-response genes was constructed, which contains 923 pharmacokinetic genes, 703 pharmacodynamic genes and 720 miRNAs. miRNA variations can affect drug resistance, efficacy, and metabolism, opening new avenues of pharmacogenomics research. we studied the pharmacologic roles of three microRNAs previously implicated in cancer biology (let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21) and also used in silico methods to test pharmacologic microRNA effects more broadly. n silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Ten of those microRNAs have already been implicated in cancer biology. Our results support a substantial role for microRNAs in anticancer drug response, suggesting novel potential approaches to the improvement of chemotherapy. The NCI-60 has also been profiled for mRNA and protein expression, mutational status, chromosomal aberrations, and DNA copy number, generating an unparalleled public resource for integrated chemogenomic studies. To complement the existing NCI-60 data sets, we have measured expression levels of microRNAs in the NCI-60 and incorporated the resulting data into the CellMiner program package for integrative analysis. . Comparison of microRNA expression patterns and compound potency patterns showed significant correlations, suggesting that microRNAs may play a role in chemoresistance. Combined with gene expression and other biological data using multivariate analysis, microRNA expression profiles may provide a critical link for understanding mechanisms involved in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance.

Isn't nicotinamide effective for skin cancer prevention?,no,"Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses. ESULTS: At 12 months, the rate of new nonmelanoma skin cancers was lower by 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 38) in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group (P=0.02). Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05). The number of actinic keratoses was 11% lower in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group at 3 months (P=0.01), 14% lower at 6 months (P<0.001), 20% lower at 9 months (P<0.001), and 13% lower at 12 months (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients. Nicotinamide is a safe, widely available vitamin that reduces the immune suppressive effects of UV, enhances DNA repair in keratinocytes and has shown promise in the chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer.   In summary, nicotinamide, by enhancing DNA repair in melanocytes, is a potential agent for the chemoprevention of cutaneous melanoma. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers.  Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) prevents UV-induced immunosuppression and carcinogenesis in mice, and solar-simulated (ss) UV-induced immunosuppression in humans. These results show that nicotinamide enhances two different pathways for repair of UV-induced photolesions, supporting nicotinamide's potential as an inexpensive, convenient and non-toxic agent for skin cancer chemoprevention. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers. No noteworthy between-group differences were found with respect to the number or types of adverse events during the 12-month intervention period, and there was no evidence of benefit after nicotinamide was discontinued.CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients.  Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses.METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 386 participants who had had at least two nonmelanoma skin cancers in the previous 5 years to receive 500 mg of nicotinamide twice daily or placebo for 12 months.  Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05).  Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients. Nicotinamide has shown potential as a safe and effective intervention for the prevention of malignant and premalignant skin lesions. Nicotinamide, which protected against both UVB and UVA, is a promising agent for skin cancer prevention."
Is there an association between serum interleukin-6 concentrations and outcomes of stroke patients?,yes,"In addition, IL-6 concentrations affect clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke. After appropriate adjustment, the odds ratios for the association of markers and poor outcome (comparing the upper and the lower third) were interleukin-6, 3.1 (95% CI: 1.9-5.0); C-reactive protein, 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2-3.1); fibrinogen, 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0-2.36); white cell count, 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3-3.4); and glucose 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.1). The results for interleukin-6 were similar to other studies.  -6 and IL-10 levels were higher in patients with poor outcome. On logistic regression analysis, higher values of IL-6 were significantly associated with clinical outcome at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.54).  In hemorrhagic stroke, high levels of IL-6 in the early phase indicated a poor neurological outcome. Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points. Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0.001 for NIHSS and p=0.001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-IL-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.  Another negative correlation was found between IL-6 and CNS scores (r = -0.451, p = 0.000). In addition, increased levels of IL-6 and reduced levels of protein C and protein S may play a role in acute ischemic stroke severity. Variables that are predictors of adverse stroke outcome include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1."
Couldn't bioprinting be used in regenerative medicine against bone disease?,no,"Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves in the craniomaxillofacial complex), and complex organs with intricate 3D microarchitecture (e.g. liver, lymphoid organs), several technological limitations must be addressed.  It is expected that these new findings will give an innovation boost for the development of scaffolds for bone repair and reconstruction, which began with the use of bioinert materials, followed by bioactive materials and now leading to functional regenerative tissue units. These new developments have become possible with the discovery of the morphogenic activity of bioinorganic polymers, biocalcit, bio-polyphosphate and biosilica that are formed by a biogenic, enzymatic mechanism, a driving force along with the development of novel rapid-prototyping three-dimensional (3D) printing methods and bioprinting (3D cell printing) techniques that may allow a fabrication of customized implants for patients suffering in bone diseases in the future.

Is macroautophagy a selective degradation process?,yes,"Selective autophagy Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a bulk degradation system for cytoplasmic components and is ubiquitously found in eukaryotic cells Here we show that selective autophagy downregulates Ty1 transposition We propose that selective autophagy safeguards genome integrity against excessive insertional mutagenesis caused during nutrient starvation by transposable elements in eukaryotic cells. Moreover, it is becoming apparent that proteins, organelles, and pathogens can be targeted for autophagic clearance by selective mechanisms Cell spreading required ref(2)P, the Drosophila p62 multiadaptor, implicating selective autophagy as a novel mechanism for modulating cortical dynamics The selective macroautophagic degradation There is growing evidence that macroautophagic cargo is not limited to bulk cytosol in response to starvation and can occur selectively for substrates, including aggregated proteins. It remains unclear, however, whether starvation-induced and selective macroautophagy share identical adaptor molecules to capture their cargo. Here, we report that Alfy, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein, is central to the selective elimination of aggregated proteins. We propose that Alfy plays a key role in selective macroautophagy by bridging cargo to the molecular machinery that builds autophagosomes. Thus, cytoplasmic NBR1 might be important to maintain basal levels of selective macroautophagy in these neurons. we could show that Smatg8 and Smatg4 are not only required for nonselective macroautophagy, but for selective macropexophagy as well. The latter is performed by proteasome-mediated degradation, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and selective macroautophagy, Here we demonstrate a role for PtdIns 4-kinases and PtdIns4P 5-kinases in selective and nonselective types of autophagy in yeast. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a degradative cellular pathway that protects eukaryotic cells from stress, starvation, and microbial infection. Previously, we showed that macroautophagy is necessary for conidiation in the rice-blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we analyzed the physiological function(s) of selective autophagy in Magnaporthe Serine 403 phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 regulates selective autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins. Selective macroautophagy (autophagy) of ubiquitinated protein is implicated as a compensatory mechanism of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. p62/SQSTM1 is a key molecule managing autophagic clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins. Whole organelle turnover is mediated through macroautophagy, a process by which autophagosomes deliver mitochondria to the lysosome for hydrolytic degradation. While mitochondrial autophagy can occur as part of a nonselective upregulation of autophagy, selective degradation of damaged or unneeded mitochondria (mitophagy) is a rapidly growing area in development, cancer, and neurodegeneration, particularly with regard to Parkinson's disease BAG3 was recently described as a mediator of a novel macroautophagy pathway that uses the specificity of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) to misfolded proteins and also involves other protein partners, such as HSPB8. two Parkinson disease (PD) associated genes, PINK1 and Parkin, were shown to mediate the degradation of damaged mitochondria via selective autophagy (mitophagy) Here we show that whole mitochondria are turned over via macroautophagy. Does Huntingtin play a role in selective macroautophagy? In the discussion here I suggest that Htt may have a normal function in the lysosomal mechanism of selective macroautophagy involved in its own degradation Macroautophagy induced by ethanol seemed to be selective for damaged mitochondria and accumulated lipid droplets, but not long-lived proteins, which could account for its protective effects Although macroautophagy can be nonspecific, there are many examples of selective sequestration including pexophagy, mitophagy and the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. Mitochondria autophagy (mitophagy) is the process of selective degradation of mitochondria that has an important role in mitochondrial quality control. One of the genes identified, YLR356W, is required for mitophagy, but not for macroautophagy or other types of selective autophagy. A genomic screen for yeast mutants defective in selective mitochondria autophagy. Mitophagy is the process of selective mitochondrial degradation via autophagy, which has an important role in mitochondrial quality control. Analysis of this set of targeted deletion mutants demonstrated that loss of any of the 16 genes necessary for nonselective macroautophagy renders the fungus unable to cause rice blast disease, due to impairment of both conidial programmed cell death and appressorium maturation. In contrast, genes necessary only for selective forms of autophagy, such as pexophagy and mitophagy, are dispensable for appressorium-mediated plant infection. This gene is not required for other types of selective autophagy or for nonspecific macroautophagy. However, in contrast to the core autophagy genes such as atg5 and atg7, expression of ulk1 is not essential for induction of macroautophagy in response to nutrient deprivation or for survival of newborn mice. Together, these data suggest that the ATG1 homologue, Ulk1, is a component of the selective autophagy machinery that leads to the elimination of organelles in erythroid cells rather that an essential mechanistic component of autophagy. Growing evidence supports an active role for dysregulated macroautophagy (autophagic stress) in neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration. Alterations in mitochondrial function and dynamics are also strongly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, whereas the core autophagy machinery is evolutionarily conserved and shared among constitutive and induced or selective autophagy, recent studies implicate distinct mechanisms regulating mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in response to general autophagic stimuli. We discovered that activation of the UPR in yeast also induces a new branch of macroautophagy that selectively targets the ER. We term this process ""ER-phagy"", in analogy to pexophagy and mitophagy, the two other known forms of organelle-specific marcoautophagy. ER-phagy involves the generation of autophagosomes that selectively include ER membranes and whose delimiting double membranes also derive, at least in part, from the ER. This suggests that in fungi an organism-specific form of selective autophagy may occur, for which specialized Atg proteins have evolved. ransfer of Y. lipolytica cells from oleate/ethylamine to glucose/ammonium chloride medium leads to selective macroautophagy of peroxisomes. Insulin-dependent signaling regulates azurophil granule-selective macroautophagy in human myeloblastic cells. We show that insulin-dependent signals regulate azurophil granule-selective macroautophagy in human myeloid cells. By contrast, other organelles, including the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus remained intact, indicating that the macroautophagy selectively targeted azurophil granules. Thus, insulin-dependent signals are responsible for the control of azurophil granule-selective macroautophagy via Akt-dependent pathways Eukaryotic cells have the ability to degrade proteins and organelles by selective and nonselective modes of micro- and macroautophagy. For example, pexophagy is a selective process for the regulated degradation of peroxisomes by autophagy. We have characterized biochemically, morphologically, and genetically two distinct pathways for the selective degradation of peroxisomes in Pichia pastoris. These pathways are independently regulated and analogous to microautophagy and macroautophagy that have been defined in mammalian cells. If we are willing to slightly modify our definition of autophagy, with a focus on ""degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal/vacuolar machinery,"" we can include a newly documented process, programmed nuclear destruction (PND). Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that can sequester cytosolic material, including organelles, nonspecifically in a process called nonselective macroautophagy, or target specific protein aggregates designated for destruction in a process called selective autophagy. Selective macroautophagy uses double-membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, to transport cytoplasmic pathogens, organelles and protein complexes to the vacuole for degradation. Autophagy (macroautophagy), a highly conserved eukaryotic mechanism, is a non-selective degradation process, helping to maintain a balance between the synthesis, degradation and subsequent recycling of macromolecules to overcome various stress conditions. Whole organelle turnover is mediated through macroautophagy, a process by which autophagosomes deliver mitochondria to the lysosome for hydrolytic degradation. Macroautophagy is a catabolic process by which the cell degrades cytoplasmic components through the lysosomal machinery. Macroautophagy maintains cellular homeostasis through targeting cytoplasmic contents and organelles into autophagosomes for degradation. Macroautophagy is a catabolic process by which cytosolic components are sequestered by double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and sorted to the lysosomes/vacuoles to be degraded. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a cellular degradation process, which in yeast is induced in response to nutrient deprivation. Macroautophagy was thought to be an unspecific bulk degradation process. Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular degradation process by which cells remove cytosolic long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, and can be monitored by imaging the incorporation of microtubule-associated light chain 3 (LC3) fused to a fluorescent protein (GFP or mCherry) into nascent autophagosomes. Beside macroautophagy, there are several forms of selective autophagy, including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt), pexophagy and mitophagy. Macroautophagy (commonly referred to as autophagy) is the process by which intact organelles and/or large portions of the cytoplasm are engulfed within double-membraned autophagic vacuoles for degradation. This analysis demonstrated that Atg proteins required for non-selective macroautophagy are conserved from yeast to man, stressing the importance of this process in cell survival and viability. Part of the degradation of intracellular proteins occurs in the lysosomes and is mediated by macroautophagy."
Is muscle regeneration possible in mdx mice with the use of induced mesenchymal stem cells?,yes,"Purified iMSCs displayed fibroblast-like morphology, formed three-dimensional spheroid structures, and expressed characteristic mesenchymal stem cell surface markers such as CD29, CD33, CD73, CD90, and CD105. Moreover, iMSCs were capable of differentiating into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Transplanting iMSC cells to tibialis anterior skeletal muscle tissue in mdx mice lowered oxidative damage as evidenced by a reduction in nitrotyrosine levels, and normal dystrophin expression levels were restored This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of purified iMSCs in skeletal muscle regeneration in mdx mice Flk-1+ adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into skeletal muscle satellite cells and ameliorate muscular dystrophy in mdx mice Within mdx mice, an animal model of DMD, adipose tissue-derived Flk-1(+) MSCs (AD-MSCs) homed to and differentiated into cells that repaired injured muscle tissue.

Can ferric carboxymaltose be None use to treat anemia in inflammatory bowel disease patients?,no,"Intravenous iron should be preferred where oral iron is poorly tolerated or where it has failed in moderate to severe anemia, and in combination with erythropoietin Ferric carboxymaltose is much more convenient, and has been shown to be more effective than iron sucrose in a large randomized tria nemia and iron deficiency anemia are very common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD Ferric carboxymaltose was associated with cost savings of 30-44 % per patient per treatment cycle compared to iron sucrose.  Iron deficiency is common in pregnancy, postpartum, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, heavy uterine bleeding, cancer and following surgery. We estimate the budget impact (BI) on the Swiss mandatory health insurance associated with substituting iron sucrose (standard) with ferric carboxymaltose (new treatment) using real-life data. reating iron deficiency involves substantial costs to the Swiss MHI which may be reduced by substituting iron sucrose with ferric carboxymaltose. e aim of this study was to observe, in a non-interventional way, how Swedish gastroenterologists adhere to guidelines in IBD outpatients treated with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), and the result of treatment FCM lowers platelet counts and platelet activation in patients with IBD-associated secondary thrombocytosis. We performed a randomized, single-blinded placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with IBD with secondary thrombocytosis (platelets > 450 G/L) e performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine if administration of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) prevents anemia in patients with IBD and low levels of serum ferritin FCM prevents recurrence of anemia in patients with IBD, compared with placebo.   A subgroup was analyzed regarding efficacy and side effects of iron supplementation with ferric carboxymaltose. Iron deficiency and anemia are frequent in IBD patients. Treatment with ferric carboxymaltose is efficious, safe and well tolerated in iron-deficient IBD patients.  Intravenous iron avoids these concerns, especially with the development of ferric carboxymaltose, which allow up to 1000mg to be given rapidly. What is the optimal treatment for anemia in inflammatory bowel disease? We compared the efficacy and safety of a novel fixed-dose ferric carboxymaltose regimen (FCM) with individually calculated iron sucrose (IS) doses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IDA Study drugs were well tolerated and drug-related adverse events were in line with drug-specific clinical experience  The simpler FCM-based dosing regimen showed better efficacy and compliance, as well as a good safety profile, compared with the Ganzoni-calculated IS dose regimen. Ferric carboxymaltose can be rapidly administered in doses of 15 mg/kg body weight, up to a ceiling dose of 1000 mg. A test dose is not required, and it can be used more widely across a spectrum of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia indication  Intravenous iron offers a rapid means of iron repletion and is superior to oral iron in many circumstances, especially in the presence of anemia of chronic disease, where it appears to overcome the block to absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract and immobilization of stored iron. The clinical situations where high doses of iron are commonly required are reviewed. These include nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, obstetrics, menorrhagia, and anemia associated with cancer and its treatment.  Ferric carboxymaltose can be administered at 15 mg/kg body weight to a maximum dose of 1000 mg, whereas iron isomaltoside 1000 can be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight. The ability to give high doses of iron is important in the context of managing iron deficiency anemia in a number of clinical conditions where demands for iron are high (including chronic blood loss associated with inflammatory bowel disease, menorrhagia, and chronic kidney disease) erric carboxymaltose (FCM, Ferinject) was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in nine, Phase III, randomized, controlled, multicenter trials in a diverse range of indications, including patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), post-partum anemia (PPA) or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), chronic heart failure (CHF), non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those undergoing hemodialysis (HD In patients with IBD or PPA, improvements in Hb levels were more rapid with FCM than with FeSulf.  CM improved patient quality of life to an equivalent extent to oral FeSulf in patients with IBD or PPA, and to a greater extent than oral FeSulf in women with AUB Four different products are principally used in clinical practice, which differ in their pharmacokinetic properties and safety profiles: iron gluconate and iron sucrose (lower single doses), and iron dextran and ferric carboxymaltose (higher single doses). he prevalence of anemia across studies on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is high (30%).  novel intravenous iron formulation for treatment of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease: the ferric carboxymaltose (FERINJECT) randomized controlled trial. FeCarb is effective and safe in IBD-associated anemia. It is noninferior to FeSulf in terms of Hb change over 12 wk, and provides a fast Hb increase and a sufficient refill of iron stores. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 28.5% of the FeCarb and 22.2% of the FeSulf groups, with discontinuation of study medication due to AEs in 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively. The median Hb improved from 8.7 to 12.3 g/dL in the FeCarb group and from 9.1 to 12.1 g/dL in the FeSulf group, demonstrating noninferiority (P= 0.6967).

Is there any association of the chromosomal region harboring the gene ITIH3 with schizophrenia?,yes,"The most widely shared subset of genes-common to five of six disorders-included ANK3, AS3MT, CACNA1C, CACNB2, CNNM2, CSMD1, DPCR1, ITIH3, NT5C2, PPP1R11, SYNE1, TCF4, TENM4, TRIM26, and ZNRD1.  Genome-wide significant associations in schizophrenia to ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8, and extensive replication of associations reported by the Schizophrenia PGC. After combining the new schizophrenia data with those of the PGC, variants at three loci (ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8) that had not previously been GWS in schizophrenia attained that level of support. In a joint analysis with a bipolar disorder sample (16,374 affected individuals and 14,044 controls), three loci reached genome-wide significance: CACNA1C (rs4765905, P = 7.0 × 10(-9)), ANK3 (rs10994359, P = 2.5 × 10(-8)) and the ITIH3-ITIH4 region (rs2239547, P = 7.8 × 10(-9)). Finally, a combined GWAS analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder yielded strong association evidence for SNPs in CACNA1C and in the region of NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4.  A recent genome-wide analysis indicated that a polymorphism (rs2535629) of ITIH3 showed the strongest association signal with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in Caucasian populations. We detected a novel association between suicide attempt and the ITIH3/4-region in a combined group of patients with BD, SCZ and related psychosis spectrum disorders.  These include variations in chromosomal structure at 16p11.2, rare de novo point mutations at the gene SCN2A, and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping near loci encoding the genes ITIH3, AS3MT, CACNA1C and CACNB2. These selected examples point to the challenges to current diagnostic approaches.  STAB1 is located in close proximity to PBMR1 and the NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4 region, which are the top findings from GWAS meta-analyses of mood disorder, and a combined BD and schizophrenia data set. Our findings suggest that rs2535629 influences the susceptibility to psychiatric disorders by affecting the expression level of GLT8D1."
Is the regulation of Vsr endonuclease independent of the growth phase of bacteria?,no,"Growth phase-dependent regulation of Vsr endonuclease Vsr endonuclease levels are growth phase dependent. Growth phase-dependent regulation of Vsr endonuclease may contribute to 5-methylcytosine mutational hot spots in Escherichia coli. Using rabbit polyclonal antibodies, we have shown that the Dcm cytosine methylase of Escherichia coli is maintained at a constant level during cell growth, while Vsr endonuclease levels are growth phase dependent. Vsr endonuclease, which initiates very short patch repair, has been hypothesized to regulate mutation in stationary-phase cells. The efficiency of the two pathways changes during the bacterial life cycle; MMR is more efficient during exponential growth and VSP repair is more efficient during the stationary phase. Overexpression of Vsr does dramatically increase the stationary-phase reversion of a Lac- frameshift allele, but the absence of Vsr has no effect.

Are there interactomes available for POU5F1 and SOX2?,yes,"The interactomes of POU5F1 and SOX2 enhancers in human embryonic stem cells. We assayed long-range chromosomal interactions on putative enhancers of POU5F1 and SOX2 genes in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using 4C-Seq technique. We discovered that their frequent interacting regions mainly overlap with early DNA replication domains. The interactomes are associated with active histone marks and enriched with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine sites. In hESCs, genes within the interactomes have elevated expression. Additionally, some genes associated with the POU5F1 enhancer contribute to pluripotency. Binding sites for multiple DNA binding proteins, including ATF3, CTCF, GABPA, JUND, NANOG, RAD21 and YY1, are enriched in both interactomes."
Isn't there any cross-talk between the Wnt and the Akt pathways?,no,"Our data demonstrate that engaging Wnt signaling at the receptor level by this method leads to necessary crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways including activation of Akt, mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, PKA/CREB, and inhibition of RhoA/ROCK that substantially increase human β-cell proliferation while maintaining the β-cell phenotype. The cross-talk role of Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with GSK-3β as the key enzyme bridging these pathways, may contribute to the inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cells by hUC-MSCs. We find that Wnt stimulation leads to phosphorylation of insulin signaling key mediators, including Akt, GSK3β, and ERK1/2, although with a lower fold stimulation and slower time course than observed for insulin. Wnt induces phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3β, and this is dependent on insulin/IGF-1 receptors. Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K resulted in the downregulation of several members of the β-catenin pathway, including Fra-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Similar results were observed in vivo, as intratumoral injection of LY294002 downregulated the expression of the components of the β-catenin pathway and delayed tumor growth in nude mice harboring subcutaneous LN229 xenografts. These results suggest that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates glioma cell proliferation, in part via repression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Small-molecule inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin pathway cross-talk and suppress medulloblastoma growth Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway affected beta-catenin signaling by activation [corrected] of GSK-3beta, [corrected] resulting in cytoplasmic retention of beta-catenin and reduced expression of its target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. These findings demonstrate the importance of cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and beta-catenin pathways in medulloblastoma and rationalize the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in treatment of this disease. Western blot analyses revealed that the recombinant Wnt ligand Wnt-3A increased phosphorylation of AKT and the downstream kinase glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta as well as accumulation of activated, nuclear beta-catenin. Chemical inhibition of PI3K abolished Wnt-dependent phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3beta and trophoblast motility but did not affect appearance of activated beta-catenin or Wnt/TCF reporter activity. The data suggest that Wnt-3A may activate canonical Wnt signaling and PI3K/AKT through distinct receptors. Mutational activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway occurs in a wide variety of tumors, whereas activating Wnt pathway mutants are predominantly found in colon cancer. Because GSK3 is a key component of both pathways, it is widely assumed that active PI3K signaling feeds positively into the Wnt pathway by protein kinase B (PKB)-mediatefd inhibition of GSK3. n addition, PKB has been proposed to modulate the canonical Wnt signaling through direct stabilization and nuclear localization of beta-catenin. Here, we show that compartmentalization by Axin of GSK3 prohibits cross-talk between the PI3K and Wnt pathways and that Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity is not modulated by activation of the PI3K/PKB pathway. Our recent study revealed a second mechanism for Cby-mediated beta-catenin inhibition in which Cby cooperates with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins to facilitate nuclear export of beta-catenin, following phosphorylation of Cby by Akt kinase. Therefore, our findings unravel a novel molecular mechanism regulating the dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of beta-catenin and provide new insights into the cross-talk between the Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. Here, we review recent literature concerning Cby function and discuss our current understanding of the relationship between Wnt and Akt signaling. As inappropriate activation of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling causes late-onset GCT development and cross talk between the PI3K/AKT and WNT/CTNNB1 pathways has been reported, we tested whether these pathways could synergize in GCT. This explains why prostate tumors subjected to androgen ablation experience an increase in Akt phosphorylation, and suggest that the tumor compensates for the loss of one pathway with another. Different modes of interaction between the two pathways, including direct interaction, or regulation via downstream intermediates, such as the wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway, NF-kappaB, and the FOXO family of transcription factors, will be discussed. FGF signals are transduced through FGF receptor to the FRS2-GRB2-GAB1-PI3K-AKT signaling cascade to downregulate GSK3beta activity depending on Ser 9 phosphorylation. Because GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin and SNAIL leads to FBXW1 (betaTRCP)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, GSK3beta downregulation results in the stabilization and the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and SNAIL. Bridging the BMP and Wnt pathways by PI3 kinase/Akt and 14-3-3zeta Concurrently, PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, is also primarily inactivated in the ISCs, leading to activation of Akt. Thus, Akt may contribute to activation of beta-catenin in ISCs in coordination with Wnt signaling. Thus, we propose that BMP signaling plays a role in inhibition of ISC self-renewal through suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ISC, and this cross-talk is bridged, at least in part, through the PTEN/Akt pathway and further enforced by 14-3-3zeta. In MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cultures, dexamethasone (DEX) activates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) and inhibits a differentiation-related cell cycle that occurs at a commitment stage immediately after confluence. Here we show that DEX inhibition of the differentiation-related cell cycle is associated with a decrease in beta-catenin levels and inhibition of LEF/TCF-mediated transcription. These inhibitory activities are no longer observed in the presence of lithium, a GSK3beta inhibitor. DEX decreased the serum-responsive phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt-Ser(473) within minutes, and this inhibition was also observed after 12 h. When the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway was inhibited by wortmannin, DEX no longer inhibited beta-catenin levels. Furthermore, DEX-mediated inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity was attenuated in the presence of dominant negative forms of either PI3K or protein kinase B/Akt. These results suggest cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. These results suggest that inhibition of a PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin/LEF axis and stimulation of HDAC1 cooperate to mediate the inhibitory effect of DEX on Wnt signaling and the osteoblast differentiation-related cell cycle. WISP-1 (Wnt-1-induced secreted protein) was identified as an oncogene regulated by the Wnt-1-beta-catenin pathway. Here it is shown that WISP-1 can activate the antiapoptotic Akt/PKB signaling pathway.  Our results show that both TGFβ1 and Wnt3a lead to increased accumulation of β-catenin, phosphorylation of AKT and p44/42 MAPK."

GFP-transgenic animals for in vivo imaging: rats, rabbits, and pigs. We have further extended the techniques of genetic engineering to rats, rabbits, and pigs, and have created corresponding GFP-transgenic animals.

Is the Snord116 cluster associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome?,yes,"All three deletions included SNORD116, but only two encompassed parts of SNURF-SNRPN, implicating SNORD116 as the major contributor to the Prader-Willi phenotype. Our case adds further information about genotype-phenotype correlation and supports the hypothesis that SNORD116 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome These results demonstrate that the AS candidate drug topotecan acts predominantly through stabilizing R loops and chromatin decondensation at the paternally expressed PWS Snord116 locus. Our study holds promise for targeted therapies to the Snord116 locus for both AS and PWS. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of RNA expression from an imprinted region on chromosome 15 that includes SNRPN, SNORD115, and SNORD116.  Recently published data strongly suggest a role for the paternally expressed small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) cluster, SNORD116, in PWS etiology. Whereas loss of function of the SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS, the role of the other genes is less clear.  Recent data suggest that snoRNA Snord116 is important for the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) characterized by hyperphagia and obesity. The current study was conducted to assess a potential cellular link between Snord116 and phenotypes of PWS.  The imprinted Snurf-Snrpn chromosomal domain contains two large arrays of tandemly repeated, paternally expressed box C/D small-nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes: the SNORD115 (H/MBII-52) and SNORD116 (H/MBII-85) gene clusters believed to play key roles in the fine-tuning of serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) pre-mRNA processing and in the etiology of the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), respectively There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, absence of a small nucleolar organizing RNA gene, SNORD116, seems to reproduce many of the clinical features. Both kits should be made available for accurate characterization of PWS/AS deletion subtypes as well as evaluating for IC and SNORD116 microdeletions. There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, absence of a small nucleolar organizing RNA gene, SNORD116, seems to reproduce many of the clinical features.  Although the SNORD116 gene cluster has become a prime candidate for PWS, it cannot be excluded that other paternally expressed genes in the chromosomal region 15q11q13 contribute to the full phenotype. In addition, recently published data provide strong evidence in support of a role for the snoRNA SNORD116 cluster (HBII-85) in PWS etiology. Identification and characterization of this case provide unequivocal evidence for a critical role for the SNORD116 snoRNA molecules in PWS pathogenesis."
Isn't lenvatinib effective for thyroid cancer?,no,"New insights in the treatment of radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid carcinomas: to lenvatinib and beyond. However, even more impressive responses and progression-free survival benefits were seen in the phase III SELECT trial with lenvatinib, giving even higher hopes for the future management of what was considered just a decade ago an orphan disease.  Sorafenib and lenvatinib, small-molecule multikinase inhibitors, were approved for the treatment of progressive, symptomatic, radioactive iodine refractory, advanced differentiated thyroid cancer in 2013 and 2015, respectively. A phase 2 trial of lenvatinib (E7080) in advanced, progressive, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer: A clinical outcomes and biomarker assessment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with and without prior exposure to VEGF therapy, the encouraging response rates, median time to response, and PFS for lenvatinib have prompted further investigation in a phase 3 trial.  Since 2011, four multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for thyroid cancer - cabozantinib and vandetanib for medullary thyroid cancer and sorafenib and lenvatinib for differentiated thyroid cancer.  Moreover, four of those investigational drugs, vandetanib, cabozantinib, sorafenib and lenvatinib, have reached a phase III clinical trial with favorable results in progression-free survival and overall survival in medullary thyroid carcinoma and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Since 2011, four multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for thyroid cancer - cabozantinib and vandetanib for medullary thyroid cancer and sorafenib and lenvatinib for differentiated thyroid cancer BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor �, RET, and KIT, showed clinical activity in a phase 2 study involving patients with differentiated thyroid cancer that was refractory to radioiodine (iodine-131).METHODS: In our phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study involving patients with progressive thyroid cancer that was refractory to iodine-131, we randomly assigned 261 patients to receive lenvatinib (at a daily dose of 24 mg per day in 28-day cycles) and 131 patients to receive placebo.  Positive phase 1 results in solid tumors prompted a phase 2 trial in patients with advanced, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC).METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with RR-DTC who had disease progression during the previous 12 months received lenvatinib 24 mg once daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal, or death."
Was tamoxifen tested for treatment of glioma patients?,yes,"Tamoxifen might have a role in the initial treatment of high-grade gliomas and should be studied in future Phase II trials building on the newly established platform of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The addition of high-dose tamoxifen to standard radiotherapy does not improve the survival of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In this study, in which tamoxifen was used in conjunction with radiotherapy, progression free survival was shown to be less good when compared with historical data HR = 3.1 (CI: 1.7-5.7). The addition of high-dose tamoxifen, although well tolerated, confers no clinical benefit to patients treated with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma treated with standard radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin and high dose tamoxifen has similar response rates to other regimens for recurrent malignant gliomas and are probably equivalent to those found using tamoxifen as monotherapy.  CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin administered alone or in combination with tamoxifen is safe and moderately effective in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors such as high-dose tamoxifen and hypericin also have been used in the treatment of malignant gliomas.  Considering these facts, polyethylene-glycol-liposomal doxorubicin with and without tamoxifen was evaluated within two sequential Phase II trials performed at our institution.  In a parallel phase-II-study investigating post-operative treatment with tamoxifen (TAM), carboplatin and radiation therapy for glioblastomas, 16 of 49 patients (33%) showed multifocal recurrence, which developed after a mean of 46 weeks, raising the question of an association with therapy. Radiation therapy and high-dose tamoxifen in the treatment of patients with diffuse brainstem gliomas: results of a Brazilian cooperative study. Brainstem Glioma Cooperative Group. PURPOSE: The efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) combined with tamoxifen (TX) was tested in patients diagnosed with diffuse brainstem gliomas in a multicenter trial. CONCLUSION: This treatment combination produced no significant change in the overall poor prognosis of these patients. Most tumors responded initially to treatment but recurred as the study progressed. A minority of patients seemed to benefit from the extended use of TX.  Tamoxifen, a protein kinase C inhibitor when administered in high dosages, is currently being used as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. We present a patient with a recurrent malignant glioma who was continued on high dose tamoxifen despite radiologic documented doubling of the tumor size and who eventually showed a delayed response to this agent nine months after initiation of treatment. The combination of oral tamoxifen (120 to 240 mg/m2/day) and subcutaneous interferon-alpha [6 x 10(6) U three times per week] was associated with significant neurotoxicity in this group of recurrent glioma patients, resulting in early study closure.

The efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) combined with tamoxifen (TX) was tested in patients diagnosed with diffuse brainstem gliomas in a multicenter trial. We tested the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of high-dose tamoxifen and interferon alpha in adults with recurrent glioma in a phase II trial. Eligible patients had radiographically measurable recurrent gliomas of any grade after initial radiation therapy. Thyroid function was suppressed to reduce IGF-1 levels in glioma patients and high-dose tamoxifen administered.  Propylthiouracil was used to induce chemical hypothyroidism in 22 patients with recurrent glioma. Activity against recurrent gliomas has been reported for both tamoxifen and interferon alpha, agents that have more acceptable toxicity profiles and that can be administered in an outpatient setting. We tested the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of high-dose tamoxifen and interferon alpha in adults with recurrent glioma in a phase II trial. Thyroid function was suppressed to reduce IGF-1 levels in glioma patients and high-dose tamoxifen administered. Radiation therapy and high-dose tamoxifen in the treatment of patients with diffuse brainstem gliomas: results of a Brazilian cooperative study. We tested the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of high-dose tamoxifen and interferon alpha in adults with recurrent glioma in a phase II trial. The subsequent in vitro testing of the tumor that was removed after the recurrence of tumor (22 months after the initiation of tamoxifen) revealed loss of sensitivity to tamoxifen. The combination of oral tamoxifen (120 to 240 mg/m2/day) and subcutaneous interferon-alpha [6 x 10(6) U three times per week] was associated with significant neurotoxicity in this group of recurrent glioma patients, resulting in early study closure."

Isn't there evidence for de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates?,no,"De novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. Evolutionary innovation relies partially on changes in gene regulation. While a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated. Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. For this, we took advantage of the massive gene loss following the last whole genome duplication in teleosts to systematically identify regions that have lost their coding capacity but retain sequence conservation with mammals. We found that these regions show enhancer activity while the orthologous coding regions have no regulatory activity. These results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish. By revealing that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences are sufficient to generate new enhancers, our study highlights an important playground for creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation. Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates.

Are EDNRB mutations involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease?,yes,"QTL analysis identifies a modifier locus of aganglionosis in the rat model of Hirschsprung disease carrying Ednrb(sl) mutations As reported previously, when the same null mutation of the Ednrb gene, Ednrb(sl), was introgressed into the F344 strain, almost 60% of F344-Ednrb(sl/sl) pups did not show any symptoms of aganglionosis, appearing healthy and normally fertile. Genetic background strongly modifies the severity of symptoms of Hirschsprung disease, but not hearing loss in rats carrying Ednrb(sl) mutations In this study, we found that the null mutation of the Ednrb gene, thought indispensable for enteric neuron development, is insufficient to result in HSCR disease when bred onto a different genetic background in rats carrying Ednrb(sl) mutations. New roles of EDNRB and EDN3 in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implication of the EDN3 and EDNRB genes in a series of patients with Hirschsprung disease from Spain and determinate their mutational spectrum. A De Novo novel mutation of the EDNRB gene in a Taiwanese boy with Hirschsprung disease Although mutations in eight different genes (EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, SOX10, RET, GDNF, NTN, SIP1) have been identified in affected individuals, it is now clear that RET and EDNRB are the primary genes implicated in the etiology of HSCR. Mutations in genes of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) signaling pathways have been shown to be associated in HSCR patients.  Interactions between Sox10 and EdnrB modulate penetrance and severity of aganglionosis in the Sox10Dom mouse model of Hirschsprung disease Molecular genetic analyses have revealed that interactions between mutations in the genes encoding the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and the endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) are central to the genesis of HSCR Genome-wide association study and mouse model identify interaction between RET and EDNRB pathways in Hirschsprung disease Thus, genetic interaction between mutations in RET and EDNRB is an underlying mechanism for this complex disorder. EDNRB/EDN3 and Hirschsprung disease type II. Analysis of the RET, GDNF, EDN3, and EDNRB genes in patients with intestinal neuronal dysplasia and Hirschsprung disease wo susceptibility genes have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene and the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene. We conclude that Ednrb loss only in neural crest cells is sufficient to produce the Hirschsprungs disease phenotype observed with genomic Ednrb mutations EDNRB mutations were detected in 2 of the 13 short-segment HD The mutations of EDNRB gene and EDN-3 gene are found in the short-segment HD of sporadic Hirschsprung's disease in Chinese population, which suggests that the EDNRB gene and EDN-3 gene play important roles in the pathogenesis of HD Functional characterization of three mutations of the endothelin B receptor gene in patients with Hirschsprung's disease Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is one the most common congenital intestinal disease. It leads to aganglionic megacolon in the early childhood. Several susceptibility genes have been identified : RET protooncogene and its ligand, glial cell derived neutrophic factor (GDNF), Sox 10, Endothelin-3 (EDN3) and its receptor B (EDNRB). EDNRB mutations are found in 5% of familial or sporadic HSCR Enteric aganglionosis in Hirschsprung disease has been linked to genes coding for endothelin-3 (EDN3) and the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) To date, three genes have been identified as susceptibility genes for Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB) and the endothelin-3 gene (EDN3) Our data indicate that RET and EDNRB mutations have a role in the aetiology of some sporadically occurring HSCR Mutations of the endothelin-B receptor and endothelin-3 genes in Hirschsprung's disease The endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB) and the endothelin-3 gene (EDN3) have recently been recognized as susceptibility genes for Hirschsprung's disease (HD) These observations confirm that impaired function of the endothelin-B receptor or endothelin-3 is involved in the aetiology of some human HD cases. EDNRB mutations appear to be associated with short-segment HD, in contrast to RET mutations, which are found mainly in long-segment aganglionosis In addition to mutations in the RET and EDNRB genes, embryonic environmental factors and/or other genetic factors appear to be involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease. Heterozygous endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) mutations in isolated Hirschsprung disease.

A De Novo novel mutation of the EDNRB gene in a Taiwanese boy with Hirschsprung disease. Hitherto however, homozygosity for EDNRB mutations accounted for the HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association. These data might suggest that EDNRB mutations could be dosage sensitive: heterozygosity would predispose to isolated HSCR with incomplete penetrance, while homozygosity would result in more complex neurocristopathies associating HSCR and WS features. Highly recurrent RET mutations and novel mutations in genes of the receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor B pathways in Chinese patients with sporadic Hirschsprung disease. Mutations in genes encoding the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) are involved in HSCR pathogenesis; however, also important in ENS development are molecules that mediate events that are more restricted than those of RET and EDNRB, act later in development and which might not be HSCR-associated. Several missense mutations of the endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB) associated with Hirschsprung disease have recently been identified. These findings indicate that these missense mutations result in loss of function of EDNRB, and may provide the molecular pathological basis of Hirschsprung disease in some individuals. Manifestation of the disease has been linked to mutations in genes that encode the crucial signals for the development of the enteric nervous system-the RET and EDNRB signalling pathways. In addition to mutations in the RET and EDNRB genes, embryonic environmental factors and/or other genetic factors appear to be involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease In this study, we investigated whether germline mutations of endothelin receptor B (EDNRB), a gene involved in Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), could also predispose for malignant melanoma (MM) However, the similarity between the distal colonic aganglionosis in Hirschsprung disease and that due to EDN3 or EDNRB mutations led to the hypothesis that levels of expression of these genes might be affected in the absence of mutation, thus causing the Hirschsprung disease phenotype Our data strongly suggest that EDNRB is involved in predisposition for two different multigenic disorders, HSCR and melanoma."

Aren't optogenetics tools used in the study and treatment of epilepsy?,no,"The emerging revolutionary technique of optogenetics enables manipulation of the activity of specific neuronal populations in vivo with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution using light. We used optogenetic approaches to test the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in the lithium-pilocarpine model of acute elicited seizures in awake behaving rats. This chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures. We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research. Optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy.  Therefore, one could optogenetically activate specific or a mixed population of interneurons and dissect their selective or concerted inhibitory action on principal cells. We chose to explore a conceptually novel strategy involving simultaneous activation of mixed populations of interneurons by optogenetics and study their impact on ongoing epileptiform activity in mouse acute hippocampal slices. Our data suggest that global optogenetic activation of mixed interneuron populations is a more effective approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, but the initial action potential generation in principal neurons needs to be taken in consideration. Recently, a number of experiments have explored the treatments for epilepsy with optogenetic control of neurons. Here, we discuss the possibility that an optogenetic approach could be used to control the release of gliotransmitters and improve astrocyte function such as glutamate and K(+) uptake, and thereby offer a potential strategy to investigate and treat astrocyte-related epilepsy. Optogenetic and designer receptor technologies provide unprecedented and much needed specificity, allowing for spatial, temporal and cell type-selective modulation of neuronal circuits. Using such tools, it is now possible to begin to address some of the fundamental unanswered questions in epilepsy, to dissect epileptic neuronal circuits and to develop new intervention strategies.  We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research. Moreover, optogenetics may be considered for developing potential treatment strategies for brain diseases, particularly for excitability disorders such as epilepsy. This chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures. How might novel technologies such as optogenetics lead to better treatments in epilepsy? WONOEP appraisal: optogenetic tools to suppress seizures and explore the mechanisms of epileptogenesis. Finally, optogenetic tools allow rapid and reversible suppression of epileptic electroencephalography (EEG) activity upon photoactivation. Our data suggest that epileptiform activity in the hippocampus caused by impaired inhibition may be controlled by optogenetic silencing of principal neurons and potentially can be developed as an alternative treatment for epilepsy. Seizure suppression by high frequency optogenetic stimulation using in vitro and in vivo animal models of epilepsy.

Does thyroid hormone signaling affect microRNAs expression in the heart?,yes,"e show that the heart regulates systemic energy homeostasis via MED13, a subunit of the Mediator complex, which controls transcription by thyroid hormone and other nuclear hormone receptors. MED13, in turn, is negatively regulated by a heart-specific microRNA, miR-208a. On the other hand, T₃ treatment increased miR-350 expression. Through a bioinformatics screening using TargetScan, we identified thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1), which negatively regulates β-MHC transcription, as a target of miR-27a hese findings suggested that miR-27a regulates β-MHC gene expression by targeting TRβ1 in cardiomyocytes. We found that a cardiac-specific microRNA (miR-208) encoded by an intron of the alphaMHC gene is required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and expression of betaMHC in response to stress and hypothyroidism. Moreover, miR-27a was demonstrated to modulate β-MHC gene regulation via thyroid hormone signaling and to be upregulated during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells or in hypertrophic hearts in association with β-MHC gene upregulation."
Isn't p100 the precursor protein molecule of the NF-kappaB transcription factor subunit p50?,yes,"We previously reported that alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice, which have a natural loss-of-function mutation in the Nik gene, which encodes a kinase essential for the processing of p100 to p52 in the alternative nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, show mild osteopetrosis with an increase in several parameters of bone formation:  Proteolytic processing of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 generates the active NF-kappaB2 subunit p52, which in turn transcriptionally up-regulates p100 expression.  The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation. NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel. The non-canonical pathway based on processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 plays a critical role in controlling B cell function and lymphoid organogenesis. Processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly controlled, which is important for proper function of NF-kappaB. Processing of NF-kappa B2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly regulated.  Processing of the NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is an important step of NF-kappaB regulation. Targeted disruption of the Rel/NF-kappaB family members NF-kappaB2, encoding p100/p52, and RelB in mice results in anatomical defects of secondary lymphoid tissues. Here, we show that in T cells infected with the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), IKKalpha is targeted to a novel signaling pathway that mediates processing of the nfkappab2 precursor protein p100, resulting in active production of the NF-kappaB subunit, p52. nfkb2 encodes two members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins: p52 and p100. The p100 polypeptide has been proposed to serve as a precursor of p52, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of p100. In most cells, small amounts of p52 are produced relative to the levels of p100, unlike the usually balanced production of nfkb1-derived p50 and p105.  The alternative or second pathway proceeded via NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK)-, IKKalpha-, and protein synthesis-dependent processing of the inhibitory NF-kappaB2 p100 precursor protein to the p52 form and resulted in a delayed but sustained activation of primarily RelB-containing NF-kappaB dimers. In one exceptional case, generation of the p50 subunit of the transcriptional regulator NF-kappaB, the precursor protein p105 is processed in a limited manner: the N-terminal domain yields the p50 subunit, whereas the C-terminal domain is degraded Proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor (NF-kappa B1) generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B p105 (NFKB1) acts in a dual way as a cytoplasmic IkappaB molecule and as the source of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit upon processing The p50 subunit of NF-kappa B is derived from the amino terminus of a 105 kilodalton precursor Regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB involves proteasome-mediated processing of the NF-kappaB1 p105 precursor protein, which generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB This effort identified NF-kappaB1 (p105), an atypical IkappaB molecule and the precursor of NF-kappaB subunit p50 NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation"
Is there a difference in the rate between gene fusion and gene fission?,yes,"we illustrate arrangement diversity within closely related organisms, estimate arrangement turnover frequency and establish, for the first time, branch-specific rate estimates for fusion, fission, domain addition and terminal loss. Rate and polarity of gene fusion and fission in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana We have identified all differentially composite or split genes in 2 fully sequenced plant genomes, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana Polarizing these events by outgroup comparison revealed differences in the rate of gene fission but not of gene fusion in the rice and Arabidopsis lineages. Gene fission occurred at a higher rate than gene fusion in the O. sativa lineage and was furthermore more common in rice than in Arabidopsis. Gene fusion and fission are thus rare and slow processes in higher plant genomes; they should be of utility to address deeper evolutionary relationships among plants--and the relationship of plants to other eukaryotic lineages--where sequence-based phylogenies provide equivocal or conflicting results. Primary factors correlating with fusion rates are the presence of transmembrane helices in HKs and the presence of DNA-binding domains in RRs, features that require correct (and separate) spatial location. In the absence of such features, there is a relative abundance of fused genes. We show that indels are the most frequent elementary events and that they occur in most cases at either the N- or C-terminus of the proteins. As revealed by the genomic neighbourhood/context of the corresponding genes, we show that a substantial number of these terminal indels are the consequence of gene fusions/fissions. We provide evidence showing that the contribution of gene fusion/fission to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins is lower-bounded by 27% and upper-bounded by 64%. We conclude that gene fusion/fission is a major contributor to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins. We found that fusion events are approximately four times more common than fission events, and we established that, in most cases, any particular fusion or fission event only occurred once during the course of evolution. Analyzing the most parsimonious pathways, we find 87% of architectures to gain complexity over time through simple changes, among which fusion events account for 5.6 times as many architectures as fission. These trees defined timelines of architectural discovery and revealed remarkable evolutionary patterns, including the explosive appearance of domain combinations during the rise of organismal lineages, the dominance of domain fusion processes throughout evolution, and the late appearance of a new class of multifunctional modules in Eukarya by fission of domain combinations We searched for examples which have arisen by one of the three postulated mechanisms: independent fusion/fission, ""duplication/deletion,"" and plasmid-mediated ""cut and paste."" We conclude that all three mechanisms can be observed, with the independent fusion/fission being the most frequent."

Isn't protein Fbw7 a SCF type of E3 ubiquitin ligase?,no,"FBW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7) is the substrate recognition component of an evolutionary conserved SCF (complex of SKP1, CUL1 and F-box protein)-type ubiquitin ligase. However, very few E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to target G-CSFR for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here we identified F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7), a substrate recognizing component of Skp-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin Ligase physically associates with G-CSFR and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. FBW7 is a crucial component of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates degradation of an array of different target proteins. F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7), the substrate-binding subunit of E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(FBW7) (a complex of SKP1, cullin-1 and FBW7), plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes. The tumor suppressor Fbxw7 (also known as Sel-10, hCdc4, hAgo, or Fbw7) is an F-box protein that functions as the substrate-recognition subunit of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and targets a group of oncoproteins for degradation.  Fbw7 is the substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)-type E3 ligase complex and a well-characterized tumor suppressor that targets numerous oncoproteins for destruction. Fbw7 is a member of F-box family proteins, which constitute one subunit of Skp1, Cul1, and F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex. The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. SCF(Fbw7) facilitates polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of various proteins such as Notch, cyclin E, c-Myc and c-Jun. Fbxw7 (also known as Fbw7, SEL-10, hCdc4, or hAgo) is the F-box protein subunit of an Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF)-type ubiquitin ligase complex that plays a central role in the degradation of Notch family members. The Fbxw7 (F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7; also called CDC4, Sel10, Ago, and Fbw7) component of the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex acts as a tumor suppressor in several tissues and targets multiple transcriptional activators and protooncogenes for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate here that Fbw7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7), the substrate recognition component of an SCF (complex of SKP1, CUL1 and F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a key regulator of NSC/NPC viability and differentiation. The SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex plays important roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated regulation of protein stability. F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7 (Fbw7) provides substrate specificity for the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex that targets multiple oncoproteins for degradation, including cyclin E, c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Mammalian Fbw7 (also known as Sel-10, hCdc4, or hAgo) is the F-box protein component of an SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein-Rbx1)-type ubiquitin ligase, and the mouse Fbw7 is expressed prominently in the endothelial cell lineage of embryos. The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase We demonstrate here that Fbw7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7), the substrate recognition component of an SCF (complex of SKP1, CUL1 and F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a key regulator of NSC/NPC viability and differentiation Here we identified F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7), a substrate recognizing component of Skp-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin Ligase physically associates with G-CSFR and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation FBW7 is a crucial component of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates degradation of an array of different target proteins"
Is there increased incidence of incontinence in athletes?,yes,"Urinary incontinence affects women of all ages, including top female athletes, but is often under-reported. The highest prevalence of urinary incontinence is reported in those participating in high impact sports. The prevalence of female stress urinary incontinence is high, and young adults are also affected, including athletes, especially those involved in ""high-impact"" sports Analysis of these data suggests that perineal pressure is decreased in female athletes compared with nonathlete women. A lower perineal pressure correlates with increased symptoms of urinary incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction. Urinary incontinence is a prevalent condition among athletes that is not openly discussed. High-level sport appears to be a significant independent risk factor for AI in healthy young women.  The prevalence of LUTS was 54.7%, and 30% for urinary incontinence. LUTS and incontinence are prevalent in female athletes. A relationship between sport or fitness activities and urinary incontinence (UI) previously has been described in women.  studies have also shown a high prevalence of SUI in young, physically fit female athletes.  There was urinary incontinence in female long-distance runners and a correlation with eating disorders. young female athletes participating in high-impact sports may be at higher risk for urinary incontinence. Results indicated that more than 25% of those completing surveys experienced incontinence and that more than 90% had never told anyone about their problem and had no knowledge of preventive measures; 16% reported incontinence negatively impacted their quality of life. There is a very high prevalence of urinary incontinence in women athletes. Women athletes should be counseled about the increased risk of urinary incontinence with ultra high-impact sports and eating disorders. Stress urinary incontinence is a barrier to women's participation in sport and fitness activities and, therefore, it may be a threat to women's health, self-esteem and well-being. The prevalence during sports among young, nulliparous elite athletes varies between 0% (golf) and 80% (trampolinists). The highest prevalence is found in sports involving high impact activities such as gymnastics, track and field, and some ball games Urinary leakage is common among elite athletes and dancers, particularly during training, but also during daily life activities. There is a high prevalence of stress and urge incontinence in female elite athletes. The frequency of SUI and urge incontinence was significantly higher in eating disordered athletes compared with healthy athletes. High impact sports activities may produce urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence during physical stresses is common in young nulliparous wome Incontinence during physical stresses is common in young, highly fit, nulliparous women."
Are conserved noncoding elements associated with the evolution of animal body plans?,yes,"Here, we discuss the evidence that CNEs are part of the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that specify alternative animal body plans. The major animal groups arose>550 million years ago. We propose that the cis-regulatory inputs identified by CNEs arose during the ""re-wiring"" of regulatory interactions that occurred during early animal evolution. Consequently, different animal groups, with different core GRNs, contain alternative sets of CNEs. Due to the subsequent stability of animal body plans, these core regulatory sequences have been evolving in parallel under strong purifying selection in different animal groups.

Aren't DNA methylation maps applicable to the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung carcinomas?,no,"Here we present a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of NSCLC samples and paired lung tissues, where we combine MethylCap and next generation sequencing (MethylCap-seq) to provide comprehensive DNA methylation maps of the tumor and paired lung samples. Analysis of the MethylCap-seq data revealed a strong positive correlation between replicate experiments and between paired tumor/lung samples. We identified 57 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) present in all NSCLC tumors analyzed by MethylCap-seq. While hypomethylated DMRs did not correlate to any particular functional category of genes, the hypermethylated DMRs were strongly associated with genes encoding transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions and satellite repeats were hypomethylated in the NSCLC samples. We also identified DMRs that were specific to two of the major subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Collectively, we provide a resource containing genome-wide DNA methylation maps of NSCLC and their paired lung tissues, and comprehensive lists of known and novel DMRs and associated genes in NSCLC. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of non-small cell lung carcinomas. Genomewide DNA methylation analysis identifies novel methylated genes in non-small-cell lung carcinomas. To identify candidate markers for use in NSCLC diagnosis, we used genomewide DNA methylation maps that we had previously generated by MethylCap and next-generation sequencing and listed the most significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The 25 DMRs with highest significance in their methylation scores were selected. The methylation status of these DMRs was investigated in 61 tumors and matching control lung tissues by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We found 12 novel DMRs that showed significant differences between tumor and control lung tissues. We also identified three novel DMRs for each of the two most common NSCLC subtypes, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. We propose a panel of five DMRs, composed of novel and known markers that exhibit high specificity and sensitivity to distinguish tumors from control lung tissues. Here we present a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of NSCLC samples and paired lung tissues, where we combine MethylCap and next generation sequencing (MethylCap-seq) to provide comprehensive DNA methylation maps of the tumor and paired lung samples. It is a very stable and specific modification and therefore in principle a very suitable marker for epigenetic phenotyping of tumors.

Aren't microRNA (miR) regulated through DNA methylation of their promoters?,no,"We found that Tcf3 down-regulation in the context of constitutively active Wnt signaling does not result from promoter DNA methylation but is likely to be caused by a plethora of mechanisms at both the RNA and protein level as shown by the observed decrease in activating histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3-acetylation) and the upregulation of miR-211, a novel Wnt-regulated microRNA that targets Tcf3 and attenuates early neural differentiation in mouse ESCs ene silencing of MIR22 in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia involves histone modifications independent of promoter DNA methylation Whereas a CpG island was identified within the promoter element of MIR22, no promoter DNA methylation was detected in these cells xtensive promoter DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation is associated with aberrant microRNA expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia Integration of DNA methylation and miRNA promoter data led to the identification of 128 recurrent miRNA targets for aberrant promoter DNA methylation Together, our findings characterize the role of epigenetic changes in the regulation of miRNA transcription and create a repository of disease-specific promoter regions that may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of CLL NA methylation of microRNA genes in multiple myeloma Recently, epigenetic dysregulation of tumor-suppressor miRNA genes by promoter DNA methylation has been implicated in human cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM) ethylation of tumor suppressor microRNAs Dysregulation of miRNA expression involved in cancer can be triggered by multiple mechanisms including aberrant DNA methylation of the miRNA gene promoter Of note, DNA methylation of tumor suppressor miRNAs has been implicated in various human cancers Moreover, miRNA silencing mediated by aberrant promoter DNA methylation can potentially be reversed by hypomethylating agents, and hence may pose a new therapeutic target in cancer  In this review, the authors will focus on the aberrant methylation of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia Here, we review those miRNAs implicated in AD that are regulated by promoter DNA methylation and/or chromatin modifications and, which frequently direct the expression of constituents of the epigenetic machinery, concluding with the delineation of a complex epigenetic-miRNA regulatory network and its alterations in AD Furthermore, we also discuss epigenetic dysregulation of tumor-suppressor miRNA genes by promoter DNA methylation and the interaction of DNA methylation with miRNAs involved in the regulation of HSC activation and liver fibrosi Instead, the cell type-specific silencing of these genes is due to enhanced p21 mRNA degradation, 14-3-3sigma promoter DNA methylation and reduced processing of the miR-34a primary transcript Some tumor-suppressive miRNAs are known to be epigenetically silenced by promoter DNA methylation in cancer In the present study, we aimed to identify miRNA genes that are silenced by DNA hypermethylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) It was found that miR-335, which is harbored within an intron of its protein-coding host gene, MEST, was downregulated by aberrant promoter hypermethylation via further methylation assays, including methylation-specific PCR, combined bisulfite and restriction analysis, bisulfite sequencing analysis and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment he levels of miR-335/MEST methylation were significantly higher in 18 (90%) out of 20 primary HCC tumors, compared to their non-tumor tissue counterparts (P<0.001) In conclusion, our results indicate that expression of miR-335 is reduced by aberrant DNA methylation in HCC."
Are nucleosomes positioned at DNA replication origins?,no,"yeast origins are characterized by an asymmetric pattern of positioned nucleosomes flanking the ACS. The origin sequences are sufficient to maintain a nucleosome-free origin; however, ORC is required for the precise positioning of nucleosomes flanking the origin. Here, we identify nucleosome occupancy as a likely candidate to set up ORI distribution we demonstrate that open chromatin domains, characterized by nucleosome depletion, are preferentially permissive for replication Nucleosome assembly of the template prevented DNA replication. Replication of chromosomes was severely inhibited at more than two-thirds of physiological nucleosome density"
Is there a relation between ANP and transcapillary albumin escape?,yes,"Thus, in a large ethnically homogeneous cohort of diabetic subjects, our data show: (1) a significant association of C708/T polymorphism with microalbuminuria in long-term diabetes and with both lower plasma ANP levels and widespread albumin leakage hese results suggest a possible role of PND gene in conferring protection from nephropathy and microvascular damage in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the increased susceptibility of the glomerular capillaries in diabetics to ANP seems to be part of a more generalized capillary abnormality, because ANP also increases the transcapillary escape of albumin. In summary, low dose ANP infusion in healthy subjects caused a shift of plasma water and electrolytes from the circulation, with albumin escape as a secondary phenomenon."
Can't chronological age be predicted by measuring telomere length?,yes,"Human somatic cells gradually lose telomeric repeats with age. This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual from their DNA. Therefore, telomere length measurement by real-time quantitative PCR cannot be used to predict age of a person, due to the presence of large inter-individual variations in telomere lengths. ur results provide the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a relationship between telomere length and mortality in the wild, and substantiate the prediction that telomere length and shortening rate can act as an indicator of biological age further to chronological age when exploring life history questions in natural conditions."
Is there an association between c-reactive protein concentrations and outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,yes,"Besides the baseline characteristics, daily interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein levels, and leukocyte counts were prospectively measured until day 14 after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Occurrence of infectious complications and application of therapeutic hypothermia were assessed as confounding factors. The primary end point was outcome after 3 months, assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale; the secondary end point was the occurrence of DINDs. RESULTS: : During a 3-year period, a total of 138 patients were included. All inflammatory parameters measured were higher in patients with unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score, 1-3). Twenty-three and 28 patients showed poor outcome and symptomatic vasospasm after SAH, respectively. Both preoperative and postoperative CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with a poor outcome compared with patients with a good outcome (P<0.05). e area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of CRP measured on postoperative day 1 or 2 (CRP POD1-2) for predicting a poor clinical outcome was 0.870, and its cutoff point of 4 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 0.826 and a specificity of 0.843. A high CRP level after aneurysm treatment was associated with severe neurological deterioration on admission, cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, and surgical decompression (P<0.05). CRP POD1-2, and not the preoperative CRP, was an independent factor in predicting symptomatic vasospasm (P<0.05). In patients with symptomatic vasospasm, an increase in the postoperative CRP was associated with the time profile of developing symptomatic vasospasm. Postoperative CRP, especially CRP POD1-2, can be a useful prognostic factor for both poor outcome and symptomatic vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Serum CRP levels were related to severity of aSAH. Patients with lower GCS scores and higher Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades presented statistically significant higher serum CRP levels. Patients with higher serum CRP levels had a less favorable prognosis. Increased serum CRP levels were strongly associated with worse clinical prognosis in this study. After SAH, the value of C-reactive protein (CRP)--an acute phase sensitive inflammatory marker--as a prognostic factor has been poorly studied, with conflicting results. Admission (18.0 ± 35.7 vs 8.5 ± 8.4 mg/l) and postoperative (41.0 ± 40.2 vs 21.1 ± 24.1 mg/l) CRP levels were higher (p < 0.001) in those with a poor outcome than in those with a favourable outcome, but CRP values did not predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or cerebral infarction. Higher increase in CRP level between admission and postoperative morning, however, independently predicted poor outcome (p = 0.004). CRP levels correlate with outcome but do not seem to predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or infarction after SAH. Systemic oxygen consumption is associated with hsCRP levels in the first 14 days after SAH and is an independent predictor of DCI. Intracranial hypertension was associated with an inflammatory response, indicating activation of the inflammatory cascade in the brain (ECF) and systemic circulation with high IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels after SAH, the latter associated with unfavourable outcome. Patients with angiographic vasospasm had higher CRP measurements in serum and CSF, in a statistically significant fashion (p < 0.0001). Additionally, patients with higher CRP levels in serum and CSF had less favorable outcome in this cohort. Furthermore, patients developing angiographically proven vasospasm demonstrated significantly elevated CRP levels in serum and CSF, and increased CRP measurements were strongly associated with poor clinical outcome in this cohort. Finally, serum concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and hsCRP during the early (P = .0055, P = .0266, and P = .0266) and late (P = .0423, P = .0041, and P = .0004) period were significantly higher in patients with DIND than in patients without DIND. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and hsCRP during the early and late period following SAH correlate with DIND CRP levels on days 5, 6, 7, and 8 were statistically significantly higher in the group of patients developing a DIND (P < 0.025, P < 0.016, P < 0.011, P < 0.0002). Overall CRP values were higher with increasing severity of the initial ictus according to the Hunt and Hess Scale and to the outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale from day 3 on. The presented data do not prove that WBCs and CRP values have a direct contribution to the pathogenesis of ischemic complications following SAH, but it supports the assertion that inflammation may present a common pathogenic pathway in the development of such complications. The CRP and TGF-beta1 levels in CSF are strongly concerned with communicating hydrocephalus after SAH."

Can't RNASeq be used for the analysis of nascent transcripts?,no,"Here, we utilize nascent RNA sequencing to document dosage compensation during transcriptional elongation. Here we show that RNA-seq can also be used for studying nascent RNAs undergoing transcription Conversely, the nuclear fraction shows an enrichment of unprocessed RNA compared with total RNA-seq, making it suitable for analysis of nascent transcripts and RNA processing dynamics."
Do RNA:DNA hybrids preferentially don't form in high or low GC regions?,no,"Intrinsic termination signals for multisubunit bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) encode a GC-rich stem-loop structure followed by a polyuridine [poly(U)] tract, and it has been proposed that steric clash of the stem-loop with the exit pore of the RNAP imposes a shearing force on the RNA in the downstream RNA:DNA hybrid, resulting in misalignment of the active site We have observed that transcription through the GC-rich FMR1 5'UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing the non-template DNA strand. Transcription termination by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) occurs at sequences coding for a GC-rich RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract. We used single-molecule techniques to investigate the mechanism by which three representative terminators (his, t500, and tR2) destabilize the elongation complex (EC). In the 5' flanking region, nucleotides -234 to -213 encompass a GC-rich region which exhibits high homology (greater than 70%) to the 5' flanking regions of the genes of all the apolipoproteins published to date, namely, apo-A-II (-497 to -471), apo-A-I (approximately -196 to -179), apo-E (-409 to -391), and apo-C-III (approximately -116 to -103). Recently, we demonstrated that cotranscriptional RNA•DNA hybrids are preferentially formed at GC-rich trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences in vitro as well as in human genomic DNA. Considering the extent of transcription through the human genome as well as the abundance of GC-rich and/or non-canonical DNA structure forming tandem repeats, RNA•DNA hybrids may represent a common mutagenic conformation. Recently, we demonstrated that cotranscriptional RNA•DNA hybrids are preferentially formed at GC-rich trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences in vitro as well as in human genomic DNA."
Does prudent diet reduce cardiovascular risk?,yes,"Using this approach, large prospective studies have reported reductions in CVD risk ranging from 10 to 60% in groups whose diets can be variously classified as ‘Healthy’, ‘Prudent’, Mediterranean’ or ‘DASH compliant’. Our findings suggest that a heart healthy dietary pattern is associated with moderately reduced risk of MI, but not related to risk of VTE. The systematically reviewed studies reveal that a high adherence to a Mediterranean type of diet or ""prudent diet"" is associated with reduced risk of CVD and some types of cancer, even in the elderly. In a large healthy Italian population, non-predefined dietary patterns including foods considered to be rather unhealthy, were associated with higher levels of cardiovascular risk factors, CRP and individual global CVD risk, whereas a ""prudent-healthy"" pattern was associated with lower levels. We observed an inverse association between the prudent pattern and AMI, with higher levels being protective. After multivariable adjustment, the prudent diet was associated with a 28% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 40) and a 17% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 10 to 24) when the highest quintile was compared with the lowest quintile.  Greater adherence to the prudent pattern may reduce the risk of cardiovascular and total mortality, whereas greater adherence to the Western pattern may increase the risk among initially healthy women. Composite diets (such as DASH diets, Mediterranean diet, 'prudent' diet) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of hypertension and CHD."
Could Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?,yes,"Here we refine our approach, and apply it to novel variants found in 2266 patients across two large cohorts with inherited sudden death syndromes, namely catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) or Brugada syndrome (BrS). Calsequestrin-associated catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT2) can cause sudden death in young individuals in response to stress.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disorder characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias induced by physical or emotional stress, in the absence structural heart abnormalities. The arrhythmias may cause syncope or degenerate into cardiac arrest and sudden death which usually occurs during childhood In many cases the cause of death can be elucidated by medico-legal autopsy, however, a significant number of these cases remain unexplained despite a detailed postmortem investigation and are labeled as sudden unexplained death (SUD). Post-mortem genetic testing, so called molecular autopsy, revealed that primary arrhythmogenic disorders including long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) may account for a certain number of these cases. We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryano Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  In conclusion, patients with CASQ2-associated CPVT should be recommended to receive ICDs to prevent sudden death when medical therapy is not effective.  Cardiac channelopathies associated with structurally normal hearts such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) yield no evidence to be found at autopsy, leaving coroners, medical examiners, and forensic pathologists only to speculate that a lethal arrhythmia might lie at the heart of a sudden unexplained death (SUD). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare adrenergically mediated arrhythmogenic disorder classically induced by exercise or emotional stress and found in structurally normal hearts. It is an important cause of cardiac syncope and sudden death in childhood. We also compare CPVT to other notable cardiomyopathic and channelopathic causes of sudden death in youth including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disease that manifests as syncope or sudden death during high adrenergic tone in the absence of structural heart defects. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts Early detection of CPVT is crucial because opportune medical intervention prevents sudden cardiac death.   If untreated, CPVT is highly lethal, as approximately 30% of affected individuals experience at least one cardiac arrest and up to 80% one or more syncopal spells. Sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease.  Hereditary non-structural diseases such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), long QT, and the Brugada syndrome as well as structural disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) cause a significant percentage of sudden cardiac deaths in the young Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms. Although structural cardiovascular abnormalities explain most cases of sudden cardiac death in young people, the cause of death remains unexplained after autopsy in 10% to 30% of cases. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and the Brugada syndrome (BrS) may account for at least one-third of these unexplained cases.  Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death. The inherited arrhythmogenic diseases associated with the transmembranous ionic channels, anchoring proteins or intracellular calcium regulating proteins are thought to be responsible for sudden cardiac death in infants, children, and young adults who have structurally normal hearts. Recent genetic analyses have identified congenital diseases such as the long-QT syndrome (LQTS), the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), the Brugada syndrome (BrS), the short-QT syndrome (SQTS), the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 (ARVC2), and the catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) /familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (FPVT).  At least some cases of sudden, unexplained death in young individuals may be ascribed to CPVT"
Does Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have anti-inflammatory activity?,yes,"have previously reported that apolipoprotein E (apoE), a protein component of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high-density lipoproteins and a potent plasma-borne atheroprotective factor, exerts anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages by switching the activation profile from M1 (""classic"") to M2 (""alternative"") in a process involving signaling via low-density lipoprotein receptor  anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages  Small peptides corresponding to the receptor-binding region of apoE mimic the anti-inflammatory activity of the apoE  Apolipoprotein (apo) E-containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties"

Is the ACE inhibitor indicated for lung cancer treatment?,no,"The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used widely as antihypertensive agents, and it has been suggested that they decrease the risk of some cancers, although available data are conflicting.  Using cell viability and fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis tests, we demonstrated that captopril inhibited the viability of LNM35 cells by inducing apoptosis, providing insight about the mechanisms underlying its antitumorigenic activities. In view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer. In order to determine the mechanism by which captopril inhibited tumor growth, we investigated the impact of this drug on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that captopril treatment significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells (Ki-67) in the tumor samples but was not associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (CD31). Using this model, we demonstrated that daily IP administration of captopril (2.8 mg/mouse) for 3 weeks resulted in a remarkable reduction of tumor growth (58%, P < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (50%, P= 0.088).  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to mitigate radiation-induced lung injury in preclinical models ACE inhibitors may decrease the incidence of radiation pneumonitis in patients receiving thoracic radiation for lung cancer."
Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?,no,"Genomic DNA is used as the template for both replication and transcription, whose machineries may collide and result in mutagenesis, among other damages. Because head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, genes should be preferentially encoded on the leading strand to avoid head-on collisions, as is observed in most bacterial genomes examined. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand remarkable strand-bias of the distribution of essential genes Head-on encounters between the replication and transcription machineries on the lagging DNA strand can lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and replication are co-directional. Replication-associated purine asymmetry may contribute to strand-biased gene distribution. strand-biased gene distribution (SGD) SGD correlates not only with polC, but also with purine asymmetry (PAS) In bacteria, most genes are on the leading strand of replication, a phenomenon attributed to collisions between the DNA and RNA polymerases. genes whose expression is important for fitness are selected to the leading strand because this reduces the duration of these interruptions Among prokaryotic genomes, the distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork is known to be biased.  We show that the evidence they provided is invalid and that the existence of lagging strand encoded genes is explainable by a balance between deleterious mutations that bring genes from the leading to the lagging strand and purifying selection purging such mutants. Based on those experimentally determined for 10 bacteria, we find that essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand, for all the 10 genomes studied, confirming previous findings based on either smaller datasets or putatively assigned ones by homology search. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This paradox could be explained by assuming that the stronger mutation pressure and selection after inversion preferentially eliminate genes transferred from the leading to the lagging DNA strand. We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under experimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and the elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the leading/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome"
Does MVIIA and MVIIC bind to the same calcium channel?,no,"We examined the post-pubertal behavioral effects of neonatal (postnatal day 7) medial prefrontal cortex infusion of either vehicle or N-type and P/Q-type presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers (omega-conotoxins MVIIA and MVIIC respectively; 6.8 and 45 pmol infused respectively) in rat pups. Additionally, the number of binding sites for radioligands labelling L- ([3H]nitrendipine), N- ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIA) and P/Q-type ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIC) Ca2+ channels was assessed in the rat retina and, for further comparison, in the rat cortex. Omega-conotoxin MVIIC (MVIIC) blocks P/Q-type calcium channels with high affinity and N-type calcium channels with low affinity, while the highly homologous omega-conotoxin MVIIA blocks only N-type calcium channels. However, omega-conotoxin MVIIC seems to bind to sites different from those recognised by omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA, which are markedly differentiated by their Ca2+ requirements for binding to their receptors. Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively. Replacement of the N-terminal half of omega-conotoxin MVIIC, a peptide blocker of P/Q-type calcium channels, with that of omega-conotoxin MVIIA significantly increased the affinity for N-type calcium channels.  Omega-conotoxin MVIIC (MVIIC) blocks P/Q-type calcium channels with high affinity and N-type calcium channels with low affinity, while the highly homologous omega-conotoxin MVIIA blocks only N-type calcium channels. We wished to obtain MVIIC analogues more selective for P/Q-type calcium channels than MVIIC to elucidate structural differences among the channels, which discriminate the omega-conotoxins. omega-conotoxin MVIIC seems to bind to sites different from those recognised by omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA,"
Is arimoclomol a co-inducer of the heat shock response?,yes,"Arimoclomol is a hydroxylamine derivative, a group of compounds which have unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression, but only under conditions of cellular stress.  In this review we summarize the evidence for the neuroprotective effects of enhanced heat shock protein expression by Arimoclomol and other inducers of the Heat Shock Response.  arimoclomol, a co-inducer of the heat shock stress response, The heat-shock response (HSR) was activated in P23H retinae, and this was enhanced with arimoclomol treatment.   We also assessed these functions in mice treated with a known heat shock protein inducer, arimoclomol.  Under conditions of excessive stress, arimoclomol induces amplification of the cytoprotective heat shock response in order to protect motor neurons from death.  Although both arimoclomol and celastrol induced the expression of Hsp70 Arimoclomol, an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in cellular stress response, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in recent years. The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression.  Arimoclomol is an investigational drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that amplifies heat shock protein gene expression during cell stress. Arimoclomol, a coinducer of heat shock proteins, delayed progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a mouse model in which motor neurons in the spinal cord and motor cortex degenerate."
Does triiodothyronine (T3) has cardiac angiogenic effects?,yes,"T3-induced cardiac sprouting angiogenesis in adult hypothyroid mice was associated with PDGF-BB, PDGFR-β and downstream activation of Akt. L-T3 significantly increased angiogenesis and cell survival and enhanced the expression of nuclear-encoded transcription factors involved in these processes. T(3) administration restored TRbeta mRNA expression level in AAC hearts to the control level. Rbeta knockout and TRalpha/TRbeta double-knockout mice both exhibited significantly less capillary density in LV compared with wild-type mice. TRbeta in the coronary ECs regulates capillary density during cardiac development, and down-regulation of TRbeta results in coronary microvascular rarefaction during pathological hypertrophy."
Isn't it possible to determine the proteome of a formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue?,no,"ver the last few years, advances in methodology have made it possible to recover peptides from FFPE tissues that yield a reasonable representation of the proteins recovered from identical fresh or frozen specimens. Thus, laser capture microdissection of FFPE tissue coupled with downstream proteomic analysis is a valid approach Qualitative proteome profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is advancing the field of clinical proteomics. Recent improvements in proteomics technologies, from the 2D gel analysis of intact proteins to the ""shotgun"" quantification of peptides and the use of isobaric tags for absolute and relative quantification (iTRAQ) method, have made the analysis of FFPE tissues possible. The ability to investigate the proteome of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues can be considered a major recent achievement in the field of clinical proteomics. The label-free approach enables the quantitative measurement of radiation-induced alterations in FFPE tissue and facilitates retrospective biomarker identification using clinical archives. Proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissue using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We report that differentially expressed proteins can be identified among FFPE tissue specimens originating from individuals with different pancreatic histologic findings. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) proteome analysis using gel-free and gel-based proteomics. This study will facilitate the development of future proteomic analysis of FFPE tissue and provide a tool for the validation in archival samples of biomarkers of exposure, prognosis and disease. The CAAR method presented here complements previously described antigen-retrieval protocols and is an important step in being able to fully analyze the proteome of archived FFPE tissue. Proteome, phosphoproteome, and N-glycoproteome are quantitatively preserved in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and analyzable by high-resolution mass spectrometry. It has only recently been shown that proteins in FFPE tissues can be identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics but analysis of post-translational modifications is thought to be difficult or impossible Results from the FFPE-FASP procedure do not indicate any discernible changes due to storage time, hematoxylin staining or laser capture microdissection. Thus, FFPE biobank material can be analyzed by quantitative proteomics at the level of proteins and post-translational modifications. A novel tissue microdissection technique has been developed and combined with a method to extract soluble peptides directly from FFPE tissue for mass spectral analysis of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Hundreds of proteins from PCa and BPH tissue were identified, espite using tissue blocks stored for as many as 28 years, high confidence and comparative proteome analysis between the leiomyomas and the sarcoma is achieved. These findings demonstrate that formalin fixation, paraffin processing, and LCM do not negatively impact protein quality and quantity as determined by MS and that FFPE samples are amenable to global proteomic analysis. Protein extraction of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue enables robust proteomic profiles by mass spectrometry."
Does HuR protein regulate the splicing process?,yes,"HuR and TIA1/TIAL1 are involved in regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA Here we describe experiments showing that HuR and TIA1/TIAL1, two kinds of RNA-binding proteins, were involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA under normal and stress circumstances HuR increased SIRT1-∆Exon8 by promoting SIRT1 exon 8 exclusion, whereas TIA1/TIAL1 inhibition of the exon 8 exclusion led to a decrease in SIRT1-∆Exon8 mRNA levels.  HuR regulates alternative splicing of the TRA2β gene in human colon cancer cells under oxidative stress Hu antigen R (HuR) regulates stress responses through stabilizing and/or facilitating the translation of target mRNAs We show here that the RBP embryonic lethal abnormal vision like 1 (ELAVL1, also know as HuR) regulates the alternative splicing of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E nuclear import factor 1 (Eif4enif1), which encodes an eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E transporter (4E-T) protein and suppresses the expression of capped mRNAs Further, endothelial-specific Elavl1 knockout mice exhibited reduced revascularization after hind limb ischemia and tumor angiogenesis in oncogene-induced mammary cancer, resulting in attenuated blood flow and tumor growth, respectively.  Changes in cellular mRNA stability, splicing, and polyadenylation through HuR protein sequestration by a cytoplasmic RNA virus Furthermore, significant changes can be observed in nuclear alternative polyadenylation and splicing events on cellular pre-mRNAs as a result of sequestration of HuR protein by the 3' UTR of transcripts of this cytoplasmic RNA virus. Here we demonstrate that expression of 2A(pro) induces a selective nucleo-cytoplasm translocation of several important RNA binding proteins and splicing factors. Subcellular fractionation studies, together with immunofluorescence microscopy revealed an asymmetric distribution of HuR and TIA1/TIAR in 2A(pro) expressing cells, which modulates splicing of the human Fas exon 6 knockdown of HuR or overexpression of TIA1/TIAR, leads to Fas exon 6 inclusion in 2A(pro)-expressing cells The differential expression levels of T-cell intracellular antigens (TIA) and Hu antigen R (HuR) are concomitant with a splicing switch in apoptosis receptor Fas in HCT-116 cells overexpression and knockdown of HuR led to Fas exon 6 skipping and inclusion, respectively. These results suggest that the TIA and HuR cellular ratio influences cell-type specific Fas exon 6 splicing pattern. Hu antigen R (HuR) functions as an alternative pre-mRNA splicing regulator of Fas apoptosis-promoting receptor on exon definition antiapoptotic regulator Hu antigen R (HuR, ELAVL1), a member of the embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila-like (ELAVL) family, promotes Fas exon 6 skipping by binding to an exonic splicing silencer ELAV/Hu proteins bind to AU-rich elements (ARE) in mRNAs and regulate their stability from splicing to translation, and the ubiquitous HuR protein has been implicated in cancerous cell growth. The HuR protein regulates the expression of thousands of cellular transcripts by modulating mRNA splicing, trafficking, translation, and stability. Hu antigen R (HuR) functions as an alternative pre-mRNA splicing regulator of Fas apoptosis-promoting receptor on exon definition. I report that antiapoptotic regulator Hu antigen R (HuR, ELAVL1), a member of the embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila-like (ELAVL) family, promotes Fas exon 6 skipping by binding to an exonic splicing silencer.  Changes in cellular mRNA stability, splicing, and polyadenylation through HuR protein sequestration by a cytoplasmic RNA virus. Further, the silencing capacity of HuR as splicing regulator resides in the RRM1 and hinge-RRM3 domains.  HuR and TIA1/TIAL1 are involved in regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA. HuR regulates alternative splicing of the TRA2β gene in human colon cancer cells under oxidative stress. The HuR protein regulates the expression of thousands of cellular transcripts by modulating mRNA splicing, trafficking, translation, and stability.  Further, the silencing capacity of HuR as splicing regulator resides in the RRM1 and hinge-RRM3 domains. Taken together, these results support a functional link between HuR as repressor of alternative Fas splicing and the molecular mechanisms modulating programmed cell death. We are interested in interactions involving hnRNP proteins participating in several steps of mRNA processing (mainly pre-mRNA splicing) and HuR with an established role in stability/translation of associated mRNAs. hnRNP and HuR proteins have a major nucleoplasmic localization and ability to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. We report here on interactions between hnRNP and HuR proteins that were identified in the context of isolated hnRNP and mRNP complexes.  Despite the fact that HuR sites are observed in intronic regions, our data do not support a role for HuR in regulating splicing."
Isn't Titin the largest single protein molecule found in Nature?,no,"Titin, the largest protein in the human body, is well known as a molecular spring in muscle cells and scaffold protein aiding myofibrillar assembly. Titin is the largest protein in mammals; it forms an elastic filament along the myofibril of cardiac and skeletal muscles. Titin is recently known as the largest protein which exists in the striated muscle sarcomere and is dynamic both in biomechanics properties and biochemical functions.  Titin, the largest protein known to date, has been linked to sarcomere assembly and function through its elastic adaptor and signaling domains. The giant sarcomere protein titin/connectin is the largest protein known to date. Titin is the largest protein known to date and acts as a mechanosensor that regulates muscle protein expression in a sarcomere strain-dependent fashion. Titin is the largest protein known, and is essential for organising muscle sarcomeres.

Does ventriculoperitoneal shunt improve normal pressure hydrocephalus?,yes,"Clinical improvement depends not only on the capability to restore the cerebrospinal fluid dynamic, but also on the ability of cerebral parenchyma to recover the metabolic function.  After shunting, the global CMRglu significantly increased (2.95 ± 0.44 vs 4.38 ± 0.68, p = 10(-7)) in all INPH patients with a mean percentage value of 48.7%.  Our preliminary data show that changes in the CMRglu are promptly reversible after surgery and that there is a relationship between the early metabolic changes and clinical symptoms, independently from the simultaneous changes in the ventricular size. The remarkable and prompt improvement in the global CMRglu and in symptoms may also have important implications for the current concept of ""neuronal plasticity"" and for the cells' reactivity in order to recover their metabolic function. Outcome of shunting in INPH is most often successful when patients are accurately diagnosed, suitably evaluated for surgical candidacy, and managed carefully throughout the preoperative, surgical, and postoperative periods. The decision to perform the only efficient procedure, i.e., a ventricular shunt operation, depends upon a number of established arguments in favor of that procedure. Clinical improvement, which is often spectacular, can then confirm the diagnosis.  During the 1st postoperative year, there was improvement in the condition of 22 patients (96%) who had received a ventricular shunt; 21 of these patients (91%) remained improved until death or for at least 5 years. Shunt treatment showed an effect on cognitive functions of distractibility of attention and motor speed, but not on intelligence of memory. Three patients deteriorated, eleven remained stable and sixteen showed significant improvement on psychological tests, mainly those for attention, motor speed and memory, but rarely did any improvement of intelligence occur."
Does Serca2a bind PLN in the heart?,yes,"The human phospholamban Arg14-deletion mutant localizes to plasma membrane and interacts with the Na/K-ATPase. Moreover, PLN-R14Del did not co-immunoprecipitate with SERCA2a (as did WT-PLN), n this review, we attempted to highlight the functional significance of PLN in vertebrate cardiac physiology. We will refer to the huge literature on mammals in order to describe the molecular characteristics of this protein, its interaction with SERCA2a There is clear evidence for direct regulatory protein-protein interactions between phospholamban (PLN) and the Ca2+-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) in cytoplasmic domains These results suggest that PLN modulates the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a through intramembrane interactions, which are disrupted at long range and in concert with disruption of the well characterized cytoplasmic interactions. Phospholamban (PLN), a homopentameric, integral membrane protein, reversibly inhibits cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) activity through intramembrane interactions. The concentration of this inhibited complex is determined by the dissociation constant for the PLN pentamer (which is mutation-sensitive) and by the dissociation constant for the PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer (which is likely to be mutation-sensitive). These results support the proposal that PLN inhibition of SERCA2a involves, first, depolymerization of PLN and, second, the formation of inhibitory interactions between monomeric PLN and SERCA2a. SLN and PLN appear to bind to the same regulatory site in SERCA. However, in a ternary complex, PLN occupies the regulatory site and SLN binds to the exposed side of PLN and to SERCA. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. . Conversely, using anti-SERCA2a antibody, both PLN and acylphosphatase were co-immunoprecipitated with SERCA2a, and the PLN amount in the precipitate decreased with increasing acylphosphatase concentrations. Reconstitution of the cytoplasmic interaction between phospholamban and Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban (PLN) reversibly inhibits the Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) through a direct protein-protein interaction, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) in heart muscle cells. Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart. Its regulatory effects are mediated through its interaction with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, (SERCA2a), resulting in alterations of its Ca(2+)-affinity In a co-immunoprecipitation of PLN with SERCA2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes."
Is there any research that relates the function of Notch Signaling with Alzheimer Disease?,yes,"RIP regulates signaling pathways by abrogating or releasing signaling molecules. Since the discovery, already >15 years ago, of its catalytic component, presenilin, and even much earlier with the identification of amyloid precursor protein as its first substrate, γ-secretase has been commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, starting with Notch and thereafter a continuously increasing number of novel substrates, γ-secretase is becoming linked to an equally broader range of biological processes. In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates. This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory. In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injury Along with β-secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid β-protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the amyloid β-protein precursor. Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, γ-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed. The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that γ-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure High physiological concentrations of Aβ monomer induced angiogenesis by a conserved mechanism that blocks γ-secretase processing of a Notch intermediate, NEXT, and reduces the expression of downstream Notch target genes. Our findings allude to an integration of signaling pathways that utilize γ-secretase activity, which may have significant implications for our understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis vis-à-vis vascular changes that set the stage for ensuing neurodegeneration. Aggregated forms of Aβ have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer disease and, thus, reducing the Aβ levels by inhibiting γ-secretase is a possible treatment strategy for Alzheimer disease. Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of γ-secretase results in Notch-related side effects. Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch. Nicastrin (Nct) is part of the γ-secretase complex and has been proposed to be involved in substrate recognition and selection"
Is depression associated with poor prognosis of brain tumor patients?,yes,"Before surgery 27 patients (35%) had BDI scores indicating the presence of depression. These scores were significantly higher in patients with a history of depression (p = 0.017) and in those with a lower functional outcome (p = 0.015). A lower functional status (KPS score < or = 70) in patients was significantly associated with high depression scores at the 3-month (p = 0.000) and 1-year (p = 0.005) assessments. At all follow-ups, depressed low-grade glioma patients had a significantly shorter survival time, 3.3-5.8 years, compared to non-depressed low-grade glioma patients, 10.0-11.7 years. The results suggest that depression and decreased QOL among low-grade glioma patients is related to shorter survival at long-term follow-up. The adverse impact of depression in relation to survival among cancer patients is currently a subject of great interest in research. In the subgroup of patients with low-grade gliomas, depressive patients had a significantly shorter survival time compared with nondepressive subjects (P = 0.031, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis). Preoperative depression seemed to be a significant prognostic factor for worse survival in low-grade glioma patients. Major depressive disorder was marginally associated with outcomes, while surgical interventions and radiotherapy did not show strong associations with test performances."

Can't Alzheimer's disease related miRNAs be detected in patients' blood?,no,"miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in AD, and these have been implicated in the regulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, tau, inflammation, cell death, and other aspects which are the main pathomechanisms of AD. In addition, regulation of miRNAs varies in blood, and cerebral spinal fluid may indicate alterations in AD. miRNA microarray analysis was carried out on blood of rats at 1 week and 2 months after injection. RESULTS: Many up- and downregulated miRNAs were detected. Blood miRNAs could be useful as biomarkers for exposure to nanoparticles. miR-298 regulates β-amyloid (Aβ) precursor protein-converting enzyme-1 (BACE1) in Alzheimer's disease.  We previously studied microRNAs (miRNAs) in AD autopsy brain samples and reported a connection between miR-137, -181c, -9, -29a/b and AD, through the regulation of ceramides. In this study, the potential role of these miRNAs as diagnostic markers for AD was investigated. We identified that these miRNAs were down-regulated in the blood serum of probable AD patients.  287 with Alzheimer disease (AD) as compared with 344 age- and gender-matched controls. In addition, we evaluated expression levels of hnRNP-A1 and its regulatory microRNA (miR)-590-3p in blood cells from patients and controls. Decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-590-3p was observed in patients with AD versus controls (0.685 ± 0.080 versus 0.931 ± 0.111, p = 0.079), and correlated negatively with hnRNP-A1 mRNA levels (r = -0.615, p = 0.0237). expression analysis of Sp1 and its regulatory microRNAs (hsa-miR-29b and hsa-miR-375) has been performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), together with Sp1 protein analysis. Significantly decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-29b, but not of hsa-miR-375, were observed in AD patients Sp1 and its regulatory hsa-miR-29b are deregulated in AD patients, possibly leading to aberrant production of downstream target genes involved in the pathogenesis.  We previously observed that miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b post-transcriptionally regulate SPT levels, and the corresponding miRNA levels in the blood sera are potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Here, we observe a negative correlation between cortical Aβ42 and sera Aβ42, and a positive correlation between cortical miRNA levels and sera miRNA levels suggesting their potential as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers."
Isn't it possible to visualize subtahalamic nucleus by using transcranial ultrasound?,no,"After measuring thermal effects of TCS and imaging artefact sizes of DBS lead using a skull phantom, we prospectively enrolled 34 patients with DBS of globus pallidus internus, ventro-intermediate thalamic or subthalamic nucleus. TCS had no influence on lead temperature, electrical parameters of DBS device or clinical state of patients. TCS measures of lead coordinates agreed with MRI measures in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis. Lead dislocation requiring reinsertion was reliably detected. TCS may therefore become a first-choice modality to monitor lead location. Two pilot studies have demonstrated that the intraoperative visualization with TCS and the TCS-assisted insertion of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus interna are feasible and safe provided there is exact knowledge on the extent of electrode TCS imaging artifacts.  Peroperative transcranial sonography for electrode placement into the targeted subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson disease: technical note The correct anatomic position of the electrode tip could be indirectly assessed thanks to the topographic relationship of the STN with the hyperechogenic substantia nigra and the nucleus ruber. CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial sonography is easily feasible during stereotactic surgery. In combination with the clinical effects of electrostimulation on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and with stereotactic x-ray images, it enables the assessment and the documentation of the correct position of implanted STN electrodes in real time.

Don't do thyroid hormone receptors change after brain injury?,no,"For example, the T3 receptor alpha was predominantly expressed in stroke-tissue, indicating that regeneration of nerves in stroke tissue may be facilitated by increased T3 receptor alpha expression. TRα expression was also increased in human infants with IVH.  Thus, in infants with IVH the combined elevation in deiodinase-3 and reduction in deiodinase-2 decreases TH signaling that can be worsened by an increase in unliganded TRα.  A rapid increase of the total number of binding sites for T3 appeared within 30 min of ischemia and reached over 40% by 3 h. During the same 3-h period, the relative binding affinity was reduced by 25%. Upon recirculation after 30 min or 3 h of ischemia, a rapid reversal of measured T3 binding sites occurred, which progressed to 20-30% below the control value by the recirculation period of 3 h."
Does nifedipine inhibit L-type calcium channels?,yes,"Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, reduced the expression of synaptogamin and syntaxin and blocked the suppressive effect of vecuronium, suggesting that both agents inhibit presynaptic L-type calcium channels. Treatment with nifedipine to inhibit calcium influx via the L-type channel Cav1.2 (alpha(1C)) inhibited the TGFbeta stimulated increase in ANK expression at all phases of chondrogenesis. Finally, we found that PKCepsilon-induced stellation was significantly reduced by the specific L-type channel blocker nifedipine, indicating that calcium influx through VGCC mediates the change in astrocyte morphology induced by PKCepsilon. However, APV and nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, failed to inhibit LTP when administered following the slow increase in ethanol. Both the metallic ions Cd2+ and Ni2+, known to inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels and T-type channels, respectively, and verapamil and nifedipine, typical blocker of L-type calcium channels completely prevented the hypoxic neuronal NO generation. Further, the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, was able to inhibit the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that at least this phase of the TMT effect was mediated by calcium channels, although nifedipine had no significant effect on the time to reach the maximal [Ca2+]i level Treatment with omega-conotoxin GVIA (3 microM) or nifedipine (10 microM) to inhibit Ca(2+) influx through N- or L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), respectively, also decreased the rate of AP repolarization and increased AP duration Concentrations of nifedipine (10 microM) and nimodipine (3 microM) that maximally inhibit L-type calcium channels reduced the sI(AHP) by 30 and 50%, respectively Consequently, it was demonstrated in the present study that nimodipine and nitrendipine inhibit both L- and N-type calcium channels and thus seem to be unique among the dihydropyridines examined in their effects on calcium channels in dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG 108-15 cells, whereas nifedipine and niguldipine appear to block mainly L-type calcium channels However, APV and nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, failed to inhibit LTP when administered following the slow increase in ethanol Calcium-channel antagonists, omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx GVIA; N-type), nifedipine (L-type), and omega-conotoxin MVIIC (omega-CmTx MVIIC; P/Q type), were used to characterize the voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels (VOCCs) involved in this release The T- and L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) mibefradil attenuates leg edema induced by the L-type CCB nifedipine in the spontaneously hypertensive rat: a novel differentiating assay. L-type calcium channel antagonist nifedipine reduces neurofilament restitution following traumatic optic nerve injury. Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, restores the hypnotic response in rats made tolerant to the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine. Comparison of L-type calcium channel blockade by nifedipine and/or cadmium in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Nifedipine inhibits picrotoxin-induced seizure activity: further evidence on the involvement of L-type calcium channel blockers in epilepsy."
Isn't there any data to suggest that TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) administration can improve symptom severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients?,no,"These central nervous system (CNS)-mediated effects provide the rationale for use of TRH and its analogs in the treatment of brain and spinal injury, and CNS disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, depression, shock and ischemia. The Effect of TRH to correct the abnormal F responses in SSP might be consistent with effects of TRH to reduce spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis described previously Agents undergoing therapeutic trials at present include CNTF, IGF1 glutamate antagonists, branched-chain amino acids and TRH analogue. Evidence that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has prominent trophic effects on the motor system led to several negative therapeutic trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease of the motor system. The results of the clinical evaluation at the beginning and end of the treatment as well as after patient follow up demonstrated that beneficial effects do not occur equally in all patients but rather are transitory and do not improve the natural evolution of the disease. The neurological evaluation after acute TRH-T treatment showed an objective improvement in 3 of the 8. The outcome of the study, in agreement with some and at variance with other studies, was that TRH induced a statistically significant neurological improvement in 17 of the 23 ALS patients but little or none in the other ALS patients and in patients with other neurological diseases. [A case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disturbance of vertical ocular movement responding to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH)]. TRH injections resulted in improvement of disturbance of vertical ocular movement, but no effect was seen on the weakness of the limb. 13 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were treated with intravenous infusion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).  Similar improvements in speech, swallowing and in tongue and jaw movements were seen after iv and oral administration in nine, five and eight patients respectively.  No clinical improvement was detected.  A trial of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH) 5.0 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously every other day for two weeks produced transient increased tone in muscles, along with other (side-) effects in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Although the mechanism is not known, several reports of the effectiveness of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) in ALS were recently published. Protirelin (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) appears to be a neuromodulator in the extrahypothalamic nervous system and has been suggested as an adjunct in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Clinical studies have shown that response to TRH is state dependent, that is, it depends on whether the patient has bulbar or nonbulbar signs and is male or female. Future studies must take into consideration this state dependence as a specific feature of the pharmacological action of TRH and its analogues. Three of the studies showed a transient, statistically significant effect in at least some muscles. The two studies that demonstrated no such effect both used TRH in very small doses. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the effect of TRH in ALS is a definite, acute, and transient response.  It was found that in only 3 out of 14 patients with moderately progressed disease no improvement was achieved, while in 11 cases the improvement was from 10 to 20%. However, the improvement was transient, and TRH treatment failed to stop the progression of the disease. Only 3 patients noted subjective improvement of strength. In 6 of the 9, TRH induced a significant increase in vibratory inhibition. This suggests that the TRH-induced reduction of spasticity might be due to an increase in presynaptic inhibition acting on Ia fibres. However, 2 mg DN-1417, IM twice a day for 1 month in an open-label trial, produced no objective improvement of strength in nine patients with ALS.  Our experience suggests that this approach is safe, has high patient acceptance, and is worthy of more careful evaluation. Focal, small-to-moderate and transient improvement occurred in the muscle strength and function of patients with ALS who received TRH in dose-response and screening studies. In a small pilot study of 12 patients, 3 months administration of TRH at 10 mg per kg on alternate days resulted in localized increased strength of jaw muscles as well as significant improvement in lower extremity function. Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in patients with ALS following administration of TRH.  Mild to moderate improvement was found in 9 (56%) of 16 patients.  We thought such action of TRH to be useful to the therapy of ALS. With daily TRH, 10 patients noted subjective improvement without objective evidence, and 10 patients complained of worsening of the disease with objective decline after TRH was stopped. Statistical analysis, however, showed no beneficial effects from either acute or chronic TRH trials. A temporary increase in the strength of some muscles was detected following the administration of TRH, but no change in functional performance was noted. Neither the patients nor the investigators believed the effects were of any marked clinical significance. Nevertheless, statistically significant improvement was seen only in dynametric strength 1 hour after subcutaneous injection (p less than 0.05). Significant improvement occurred, in one patient only, on subjective speech testing during IV infusion of TRH. In none of six other ratings was there a significant difference between TRH and placebo. Subjective improvement was noted by 11 of 12 patients. Significant improvement, as shown by statistical analysis, was noted in muscle strength in the 9 patients by 5 infusions over a 4-week period and a sub-group of 5 patients treated by 8 infusions over 10 weeks. The progressive course of this disease, manifested by increasing atrophy, paralysis and disability score, was not altered.  Very high intravenous doses (2-19 mg/min) of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide) given to 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) produced a moderate to marked improvement of functions caused by deficiency of lower motor neurons (weakness) and upper motor neurons (spasticity). The improvement was sustained throughout the infusion and for about 1 h thereafter; sometimes a slight improvement was evident 20 h after infusion. Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in patients with ALS following administration of TRH"
Does triiodothyronine stimulate red blood cell sodium potassium pump?,no,"reduction in Na+,K+ATPase activity has been demonstrated in red blood cells (RBCs), as well as an inverse correlation between this enzymatic action and free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels. The restoration of normal FT3 values also brings about a normalization of Na+,K+ATPase activity in erythrocytes. at hyperthyroid patients have decreased red cell Na/K-ATPase activity and provide direct evidence that erythrocyte ATPase activity is increased in hypothyroid patients. The change in enzyme activity in patients with nonthyroidal illness and decreased circulating T3 levels was comparable to that in hypothyroidism. The effect of triiodothyronine (T3) on Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 human erythroleukemic cell was studied to understand why the erythrocyte sodium pump activity is decreased in hyperthyroidism. We conclude that T3 stimulates Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 cells and in the presence of T3 during differentiation, the enzyme activity remains high."

Are immune cells affected in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,yes,"Therapeutic immunization of mSOD1 mice with a myelin-derived peptide led to CP activation, and was followed by the accumulation of immunoregulatory cells, including IL-10-producing monocyte-derived macrophages and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, and elevation of the neurotrophic factors IGF-1 and GDNF in the diseased spinal cord parenchyma Immunization with a Myelin-Derived Antigen Activates the Brain's Choroid Plexus for Recruitment of Immunoregulatory Cells to the CNS and Attenuates Disease Progression in a Mouse Model of ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective death of motor neurons (MN) in the spinal cord, and is associated with local neuroinflammation. T-cell deficiency increases neuronal loss, while boosting T cell levels reduces it. As disease accelerates, a shift occurs from beneficial immune responses (involving M2 microglia and regulatory T-cells) to deleterious immune responses (involving M1 microglia and Th1 cells). In this review, we underscore the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS and discuss the alterations and distinct phenotypes of immune cells at the different stages of disease.  Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells. The immune system has been found to be involved with positive and negative effects in the nervous system of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. In general, T cells, B cells, NK cells, mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, antibodies, complement and cytokines participate in limiting damage. Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells. We propose the following mechanism for the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) administered intrathecally in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): MSCs increase infiltration of peripheral immune cells into CNS and skew the infiltrated immune cells toward regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg ) and Th2 lymphocytes. Immune cell infiltration to the brain&apos;s territory was considered for decades to reflect a pathological process in which immune cells attack the central nervous system (CNS); such a process is observed in the inflammatory autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis (MS)."
Isn't there a mouse model for Fanconi anemia?,no,"Cyclophosphamide promotes engraftment of gene-modified cells in a mouse model of Fanconi anemia without causing cytogenetic abnormalities We compared Cy preconditioning with fludarabine (Flu) or cytarabine (AraC) or no conditioning as a control in fanca ( -/- ) mutant mice receiving gene-modified bone marrow cells We conclude that Cy is an effective and superior preparative regimen with respect to engraftment of lentivirus-transduced cells and functional correction in fanca ( -/- ) mice To study whether there is a causal relationship between FA pathway defects and tumour development, we have generated a mouse model with a targeted disruption of the FA core complex gene Fancf Fancf-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed a phenotype typical for FA cells: they showed an aberrant response to DNA cross-linking agents as manifested by G(2) arrest, chromosomal aberrations, reduced survival, and an inability to monoubiquitinate FANCD2 Fancf homozygous mice were viable, born following a normal Mendelian distribution, and showed no growth retardation or developmental abnormalities. The gonads of Fancf mutant mice functioned abnormally, showing compromised follicle development and spermatogenesis as has been observed in other FA mouse models and in FA patients In a cohort of Fancf-deficient mice, we observed decreased overall survival and increased tumour incidence To provide further experimental access to the FA-M complementation group we have generated Fancm-deficient mice by deleting exon 2 FANCM deficiency caused hypogonadism in mice and hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), thus phenocopying other FA mouse models Fancm(Delta2/Delta2) mice also showed unique features atypical for FA mice, including underrepresentation of female Fancm(Delta2/Delta2) mice and decreased overall and tumor-free survival Fancm-deficient mice reveal unique features of Fanconi anemia complementation group M Fancf-deficient mice are prone to develop ovarian tumours In vivo proliferation advantage of genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells in a mouse model of Fanconi anemia FA-D1 Using an FA mouse model with a marked hematopoietic phenotype, the FA-D1 (Brca2(Delta27/Delta27)) mice, we demonstrate that the lentivirus-mediated gene therapy of FA HSCs results in the progressive expansion of genetically corrected clones in mild-conditioned FA-D1 recipients Consistent with these data, hematopoietic progenitors from FA recipients progressively became mitomycin C resistant and their chromosomal instability was reverted Hematopoietic dysfunction in a mouse model for Fanconi anemia group D1 We have investigated the hematopoietic phenotype of mice with a hypomorphic mutation in the Brca2/Fancd1 gene (Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) mutation) Conventional BM competition experiments showed a marked repopulation defect in Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), compared to wild-type HSCs Moreover, we have observed for the first time in a DNA repair disease model a very significant proliferation defect in Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) HSCs maintained in their natural physiological environment The hematopoietic phenotype associated with the Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) mutation suggests that this FA-D1 mouse model will constitute an important tool for the development of new therapies for FA, including gene therapy In vitro phenotypic correction of hematopoietic progenitors from Fanconi anemia group A knockout mice In this study we characterized the hematopoietic phenotype of a Fanca knockout mouse model and corrected the main phenotypic characteristics of the bone marrow (BM) progenitors using retroviral vectors The hematopoiesis of these animals was characterized by a modest though significant thrombocytopenia, consistent with reduced numbers of BM megakaryocyte progenitors As observed in other FA models, the hematopoietic progenitors from Fanca(-/-) mice were highly sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC) Aiming to correct the phenotype of Fanca(-/-) progenitors, purified Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and human FANCA genes. Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells from Fanca(-/-) mice were transduced with an efficiency similar to that of samples from wild-type mice. More significantly, transductions with FANCA vectors corrected both the MMC hypersensitivity as well as the impaired ex vivo expansion ability that characterized the BM progenitors of Fanca(-/-) mice  The Btbd12 knockout mouse therefore establishes a disease model for Fanconi anemia and genetically links a regulator of nuclease incision complexes to the Fanconi anemia DNA crosslink repair pathway.

Cyclophosphamide promotes engraftment of gene-modified cells in a mouse model of Fanconi anemia without causing cytogenetic abnormalities. Mouse models of Fanconi anemia. Five of these genes have been deleted or mutated in the mouse, as well as a sixth key regulatory gene, to create mouse models of Fanconi anemia. This review summarizes the phenotype of each of the Fanconi anemia mouse models and highlights how genetic and interventional studies using the strains have yielded novel insight into therapeutic strategies for Fanconi anemia and into how the Fanconi anemia pathway protects against genomic instability. To study FA complementation group A using the mouse as a model system, we cloned and characterized the mouse homolog of the human FANCA cDNA. Here we describe the phenotype of the Btbd12 knockout mouse, the mouse ortholog of SLX4, which recapitulates many key features of the human genetic illness Fanconi anemia. Five of these genes have been deleted or mutated in the mouse, as well as a sixth key regulatory gene, to create mouse models of Fanconi anemia In contrast to observations made in other Fanconi anemia (FA) mouse models, low numbers of hematopoietic colony-forming cells (CFCs) were noted in Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) mice, either young or adult Fanconi anemia group A and C double-mutant mice: functional evidence for a multi-protein Fanconi anemia complex.

Is Rac1 involved in cancer cell invasion?,yes,"In the Matrigel invasion assay, knockdown of CCR1 and inhibition of the ERK and Rac signaling pathways significantly decreased the number of invading cells. These results demonstrated for the first time that the interaction of CCR1 with CCL5 caused by increased expression of CCR1 promotes invasion of PC3PR cells by increasing secretion of MMPs 2 and 9 and by activating ERK and Rac signaling. These data suggest that P-Rex1 has an influence on physiological migratory processes, such as invasion of cancer cells, both through effects upon classical Rac1-driven motility and a novel association with RTK signalling complexes. Activated PAR1 induced RhoA and Rac1 phosphorylation, and subsequent overexpression of myosin IIA and filamin B which are stress fiber components that were identified by PMF analysis of peptide mass data obtained by MALDI-TOF/MS measurement.  These results demonstrate that PAR1 activation induces cell morphological change associated with cell motility via Rho family activation and cytoskeletal protein overexpression, and has a critical role in gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Rac1 was found to be required for actopaxin-induced matrix degradation whereas inhibition of myosin contractility promoted degradation in the phosphomutant-expressing Quint cells, indicating that a balance of Rho GTPase signaling and regulation of cellular tension are important for the process. Taken together, this study demonstrates a new role for actopaxin phosphorylation in matrix degradation and cell invasion via regulation of Rho GTPase signaling. BART inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion by Rac1 inactivation through direct binding to active Rac1 We report that Binder of Arl Two (BART) plays a role in inhibiting cell invasion by regulating the activity of the Rho small guanosine triphosphatase protein Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells. BART interacts with active forms of Rac1, and the BART-Rac1 complex localizes at the leading edges of migrating cancer cells. Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells in which BART is stably knocked down with a Rac1 inhibitor decreases invasiveness. Thus, BART-dependent inhibition of cell invasion is likely associated with decreased active Rac1. The Rac1 inhibitor inhibits the lamellipodia formation that is stimulated by suppression of BART. Our results imply that BART regulates actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements at membrane ruffles through modulation of the activity of Rac1, which, in turn, inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion. It has been reported as an important inducer of cancer cell migration and invasion, with underlying molecular mechanisms involving the signalling mediated by its juxtamembrane domain, the secretion of matrix metalloproteases to the extracellular media, and the cleavage of a P-cadherin soluble form with pro-invasive activity. Intracellularly, this protein interferes with the endogenous cadherin/catenin complex, inducing p120-catenin delocalization to the cytoplasm, and the consequent activation of Rac1/Cdc42 and associated alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. Targeted down-regulation of RhoC led to sustained activation of Rac1 GTPase and morphological, molecular and phenotypic changes reminiscent of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. We also find that Rac1 GTPase mediates tight binding of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells and promotes retraction of endothelial cells required for tumor cell diapedesis. Finally, Rac1 leads to β1 integrin activation, suggesting a mechanism that Rac1 can mediate tight binding with endothelial cells. Together, our data suggest that Rac1 GTPase is key mediator of prostate cancer cell-bone marrow endothelial cell interactions. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Rac1 (T17N) could largely block EGF-induced PI3K/Akt-PAK1 activation and cell migration. Our study demonstrated that EGF-induced cell migration involves a cascade of signalling events, including activation of Rac1, generation of ROS and subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and PAK1. Small GTPase proteins, including RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, and cdc42, are important molecules for linking cell shape and cell-cycle progression because of their role in both cytoskeletal arrangements and mitogenic signaling. The suppression of MMP-2 expression by CTXG led to an inhibition of SW620 cells invasion and migration by inactivating Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA GTPase. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that CTXG exerted anti-invasion action in SW620 cells by targeting MMP-2 though regulating the activities of Rac1, Cdc42 and their downstream transcriptional factor AP-1. ctivation of H-Ras and Rac1 correlates with epidermal growth factor-induced invasion in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells We have previously shown that H-Ras, but not N-Ras, induces an invasive phenotype mediated by small GTPase Rac1 in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. Moreover, siRNA-knockdown of Rac1 significantly inhibited the EGF-induced invasiveness in these cells. Our data demonstrate that the activation of H-Ras and the downstream molecule Rac1 correlates with EGF-induced breast cancer cell invasion, providing important information on the regulation of malignant progression in mammary carcinoma cells. At 50% growth-inhibiting concentration, icariin significantly suppressed tumor cells migration and invasion, which were traceable to down-regulation of Rac1 and VASP.  These results indicate that icariin exerts negative effects on tumor cell invasion and migration via the Rac1-dependent VASP pathway and may be a potential anti-cancer drug. RhoGDI2 modulates the invasiveness and metastatic ability of cancer cells through regulation of Rac1 activity. We also showed that GBM cells secrete Sema3A endogenously, and RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Sema3A inhibits migration and alters cell morphology that is dependent on Rac1 activity. LMO1 and Dock180, a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promote human glioma cell invasion Here, we report for the first time that engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) and dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180), a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), are evidently linked to the invasive phenotype of glioma cells. Inhibition of endogenous ELMO1 and Dock180 expression significantly impeded glioma cell invasion in vitro and in brain tissue slices with a concomitant reduction in Rac1 activation. Members of the Rac family of small GTPases are known to act as regulators of actin cytoskeletal structures and strongly influence the cellular processes of integrin-mediated adhesion and migration. Even though hyperactivated Rac proteins have been shown to influence metastatic processes, these proteins have never been directly linked to metastatic progression.  We show that increased activation of Rac proteins directly correlates with increasing metastatic potential in a panel of cell variants derived from a single metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-435). Expression of a dominant active Rac1 or a dominant active Rac3 resulted in a more invasive and motile phenotype. Moreover, expression of either dominant negative Rac1 or dominant negative Rac3 into the most metastatic cell variant resulted in decreased invasive and motile properties. This study correlates endogenous Rac activity with high metastatic potential and implicates Rac in the regulation of cell migration and invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest a role for both the Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases in human breast cancer progression."
Is the gene SLC6A2 associated with orthostatic intolerance?,yes,"Orthostatic intolerance is a debilitating syndrome characterized by tachycardia on assumption of upright posture. The norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) has been implicated in a genetic form of the disorder.  Thus attenuated baroreflex function and reduced sympathetic outflow may contribute to the orthostatic intolerance of severe NET deficiency. A mutation in the human norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) associated with orthostatic intolerance disrupts surface expression of mutant and wild-type transporters.  Recently, our laboratory reported a polymorphism in the human NET (hNET) gene A457P in an individual with the autonomic disorder orthostatic intolerance (OI).  Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human NET (hNET) gene that influence transporter function can contribute to disease, such as the nonfunctional transporter, A457P, identified in orthostatic intolerance.  Orthostatic intolerance is not necessarily related to a specific mutation (Ala457Pro) in the human norepinephrine transporter gene. We propose that chromatin-modifying events associated with SLC6A2 gene suppression may constitute a mechanism of POTS. The goal of the present study was to further characterize the role and regulation of the SLC6A2 gene in POTS. In the absence of altered SLC6A2 gene sequence or promoter methylation, this reduced expression was directly correlated with chromatin modifications.  We propose that chromatin-modifying events associated with SLC6A2 gene suppression may constitute a mechanism of POTS. A coding mutation in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) sequence has been reported in 1 family kindred only. The goal of the present study was to further characterize the role and regulation of the SLC6A2 gene in POTS."
Doesn't neuroglobin has neuroprotective properties in the setting of traumatic brain injury?,no,"Neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral hypoxia, and therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Neuroglobin (Ngb) is proposed to be a neuron-specific, hypoxia-responsive, neuroprotective protein.  CONCLUSION: The increased expression of neuroglobin in traumatic brain injury informed us that neuroglobin had anti-apoptosis action in post-injury neuron. It could protect the neuron from traumatic stress and secondary ischemia and hypoxia insults during ultra-early and acute stages. Neuroglobin-overexpression reduces traumatic brain lesion size in mice. BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that over-expression of Neuroglobin (Ngb) is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic brain injuries.  CONCLUSION: Ngb over-expression reduced traumatic lesion volume, which might partially be achieved by decreasing oxidative stress. Neuroglobin upregulation offers neuroprotection in traumatic brain injury. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate rat neuroglobin (rNGB) expression level after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and further study its neuroprotective effects in TBI when it was overexpressed in adenoviral vector. CONCLUSIONS: NGB was upregulated in TBI and overexpressed rNGB had a significant neuroprotection in TBI.  This study suggested that rNGB overexpression may be a new strategy for treating of TBI. Neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral hypoxia, and therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to investigate rat neuroglobin (rNGB) expression level after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and further study its neuroprotective effects in TBI when it was overexpressed in adenoviral vector. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that over-expression of Neuroglobin (Ngb) is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic brain injuries. Various studies seem to indicate that neuroglobin is a neuroprotective agent when overexpressed, acting as a potent inhibitor of oxidative and nitrosative stress."
Do Conserved noncoding elements act as enhancers?,yes,"The aCNEs are rich in tissue-specific enhancers Transgenic zebrafish assay of some human CNE enhancers that have been lost in teleosts Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers, In all four cases where the zebra fish and human CNE display a similar expression pattern in zebra fish, the human CNE also displays a similar expression pattern in mouse. This suggests that the endogenous enhancer activity of ∼30% of human CNEs can be determined from experiments in zebra fish If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes. Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes. Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development. We test 42 of our PCNEs in transgenic zebrafish assays--including examples from vertebrates and amphioxus--and find that the majority are functional enhancers. The genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs cluster around genes that regulate development, and where tested, they can act as transcriptional enhancers. , we identified 17 highly conserved noncoding elements, 9 of which revealed specific acetylation marks in chromatin-immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) assays performed across 250 kb of the Lmo2 locus in 11 cell types covering different stages of hematopoietic differentiation. All candidate regulatory regions were tested in transgenic mice. An extended LMO2 proximal promoter fragment displayed strong endothelial activity, while the distal promoter showed weak forebrain activity. Eight of the 15 distal candidate elements functioned as enhancers, Pan-vertebrate developmental cis-regulatory elements are discernible as highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) and are often dispersed over large areas around the pleiotropic genes whose expression they control. HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish. several transcriptional enhancers are conserved between amphioxus and vertebrates--a very wide phylogenetic distance. We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers Besides developmental regulators that are likely targets of HCNE enhancers We identify and characterize highly conserved noncoding elements flanking the TNF gene, which undergo activation-dependent intrachromosomal interactions. These elements, hypersensitive site (HSS)-9 and HSS+3 (9 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream of the TNF gene, respectively), contain DNase I hypersensitive sites in naive, T helper 1, and T helper 2 primary T cells. Both HSS-9 and HSS+3 inducibly associate with acetylated histones, indicative of chromatin remodeling, bind the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)p in vitro and in vivo, and function as enhancers We used the sequence signatures identified by this approach to successfully assign tissue-specific predictions to approximately 328,000 human-mouse conserved noncoding elements in the human genome. By overlapping these genome-wide predictions with a data set of enhancers validated in vivo, in transgenic mice, we were able to confirm our results with a 28% sensitivity and 50% precision. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development. uncovered two anciently conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) upstream of COUP-TFII (CNS-62kb and CNS-66kb). Testing these two elements using reporter constructs in liver cells (HepG2) revealed that CNS-66kb, but not CNS-62kb, yielded robust in vitro enhancer activity."
Can't Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) be used for gender selection?,no,"This testing is used for identifying singlegene disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial disorders, gender selection in non-mendelian disorders with unequal gender distribution, aneuploidy screening, and other preconceptually identified genetic abnormalities in prospective parents.   Although many clinics offer PGD for HA by gender selection, an approach that detects the presence of the underlying F8 mutation has several advantages.  Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for gender selection for non-medical reasons has been considered an unethical procedure by several authors and agencies in the Western society on the basis that it could disrupt the sex ratio, that it discriminates against women and that it leads to disposal of normal embryos of the non-desired gender. In this study, the analysis of a large series of PGD procedures for gender selection from a wide geographical area in the USA shows that, in general, there is no deviation in preference towards any specific gender except for a preference of males in some ethnic populations of Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern origin that represent a small percentage of the US population.   In response to one specific question, one-third of the couples agreed to use the donor child as a lifetime organ donor and supported the use of PGD for non-medical gender selection.  More specifically, I illustrate how the prescriptions of deliberative democracy can be applied to the issue of regulating non-medical uses of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), such as gender selection.  Private clinics were more likely than other programs to be on either the East or West Coast, list certain PGD risks (e.g., diagnostic error), note that PGD was new or controversial, reference source of PGD information, provide accuracy rates of genetic testing of embryos, and offer gender selection for social reasons. The purpose of this article is to ascertain and appraise the ethical issues inherent to the utilisation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for gender selection in infertile patients anticipating undergoing a medically indicated assisted reproductive technique procedure. Performance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis per request specifically for gender selection by an infertile couple undergoing medically indicated assisted reproductive technique may not breach the principles of ethics, and is unlikely to alter the population balance of sexes. One possible use of PGD is to perform gender selection for couples whose offspring are at increased risk of disorders that do not follow Mendelian inheritance, but which are substantially more common in one sex than another (unequal sex incidence). Here, we examine the clinical and ethical issues to be considered prior to offering PGD gender selection to reduce the risk of a child being affected by a non-Mendelian condition with unequal sex incidence.  New uses of PGD have been reported in the past year for screening embryos for susceptibility to cancer, for late-onset diseases, for HLA-matching for existing children, and for gender.  This article describes current and likely future uses of PGD, and then analyses the ethical issues posed by new uses of PGD to screen embryos for susceptibility and late-onset conditions, for HLA-matching for tissue donation to an existing child, and for gender selection. The use of PGD for sex selection arouses considerable debate, especially in countries like India that have a marked cultural preference for boys. It is argued that using PGD for sex selection is a treatment option that can be ethically offered to couples who desire to use this technology to plan their families. Another concern is the use of this technology for nongenetic disorders such as gender selection."

Is olaparib effective for prostate cancer?,yes,"We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day.  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.   In addition, phase III trials in breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer are underway/planned, and phase I/II investigation is being conducted in other malignancies, including prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, Ewing's sarcoma and advanced cancer.  In a phase II study, researchers found that the PARP inhibitor olaparib led to stable disease or tumor regressions in patients with advanced breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers who had germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Eligibility included ovarian cancer resistant to prior platinum; breast cancer with ≥ three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease; pancreatic cancer with prior gemcitabine treatment; or prostate cancer with progression on hormonal and one systemic therapy.  The tumor response rate was 26.2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21.3 to 31.6) overall and 31.1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24.6 to 38.1), 12.9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 23.9), 21.7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7), and 50.0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) in ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, respectively. Stable disease ≥ 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36.0 to 47.4), including 40% (95% CI, 33.4 to 47.7), 47% (95% CI, 34.0 to 59.9), 35% (95% CI, 16.4 to 57.3), and 25% (95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively.  It is increasingly clear that there are molecularly distinct subtypes of various common cancers, with different therapeutic approaches required for each subtype, for example, the use of the monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and cetuximab) in HER2-positive breast cancer and wild-type KRAS colorectal cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and crizotinib) in chronic myeloid leukaemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumours and non-small-cell lung cancer and intracellular agents (vemurafenib and olaparib) in metastatic malignant melanoma and ovarian, breast and prostate cancer.

Isn't physical performance influenced by thyroid hormone metabolism?,no,"Longitudinal analysis showed that in Eut men higher baseline FT4 was significantly (p = 0.02) predictive of a lower SPPB score at the 3-year follow-up Even a modest thyroid hormone excess is associated with a reduced physical function in elderly men. Oral L-thyroxine treatment was started and at a 1-month follow-up examination, mental status and physical performance were improved In a population of independently living elderly men, higher FT4 and rT3 concentrations are associated with a lower physical function She had generalised weakness of muscles, cold intolerance and a reduced physical performance. Replacement therapy by oral administration of L-thyroxin resulted in a gradual improvement of the patient's state multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an independent predictor of VO2max changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial functional status in patients with heart failure. THR among patients with SCH is beneficial not only by improvement in lipid profile, as well as by improvement in cognitive and functional status, CONCLUSIONS: Even a modest thyroid hormone excess is associated with a reduced physical function in elderly men. Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) may be responsible for many cardiovascular changes, including an impaired exercise performance. BACKGROUND: Physiological changes in thyroid hormone concentrations might be related to changes in the overall physical function in the elderly."
Can't adult humans be induced to produce fetal hemoglobin?,no,"At the time of birth, HbF accounts for approximately 70% of the total Hb.   whereas in the trace amounts of HbF that is found in the adult it reverses to 40:60 because of a gamma- to beta-globin gene switch With the increased understanding and discovery of molecular regulators of haemoglobin switching, such as BCL11A, new avenues of research may lead ultimately to novel therapeutic, mechanism-based approaches to fetal haemoglobin reactivation in patients. The data suggest that TGF-beta reactivates gamma-globin expression, combined with a sequential stimulation and suppression of erythropoiesis."
Doesn't SCRIB deregulation promote cancer?,no,"human homologs of Drosophila dlg, scrib, and lgl are cancer-associated genes. Aberrant overexpression of the cell polarity module scribble in human cancer. we show that Scrib is nearly universally overexpressed in cultured tumor cell lines and genetically disparate cancer patient series compared with matched normal tissues in vivo.  These data uncover a previously unrecognized exploitation of Scrib for aberrant tumor cell motility and invasion, thus potentially contributing to disease progression in humans. oss of miR-296 causes aberrantly increased and mislocalized Scrib in human tumors, resulting in exaggerated random cell migration and tumor cell invasiveness.  Scrib levels predict tumor relapse in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Scrib heterozygosity predisposes to lung cancer loss of Scrib and activated oncogenic KRas cooperate in vivo, resulting in more aggressive lung tumors, l Scribble, a product of a well-known tumor suppressor gene CD74-dependent deregulation of the tumor suppressor scribble in human epithelial and breast cancer cells.  scribble (SCRIB) complexes) is intricately related to advanced stages of tumour progression and invasiveness.  SCRIB expression is deregulated in human prostate cancer, Scrib heterozygosity initiated prostate hyperplasia The clinical significance of the work in mice was highlighted by our observation that SCRIB deregulation strongly correlated with poor survival in human prostate cancer. we demonstrate that scribble inhibits breast cancer formation and that deregulation of polarity pathways promotes dysplastic and neoplastic growth in mammals by disrupting morphogenesis and inhibiting cell death. Deregulation of scribble promotes mammary tumorigenesis and reveals a role for cell polarity in carcinoma. loss of Scribble promotes invasion of cells through extracellular matrix in an organotypic culture system. Scribble expression is decreased in many invasive human cancers. Loss of human Scribble cooperates with H-Ras to promote cell invasion through deregulation of MAPK signalling."
Is the microRNA 132 (miR-132) involved in brain pathologies?,yes,"miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia. micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus. These data are consistent with the idea that altered micro-RNA-mediated processing of messenger RNA populations may contribute to atypical mRNA abundance and neural dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease brain. Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases. Expression of key neuronal microRNAs-including mir-9/9*, mir-124 and mir-132-is repressed in the brains of human HD patients and mouse models. To determine if production of miR-132 is regulated by neuronal activity its expression in mouse brain was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Expression levels of primary and mature-miR-132 increased significantly between postnatal Days 10 and 24. We conclude that miR-132 is an activity-dependent microRNA in vivo, and may contribute to the long-lasting proteomic changes required for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. We investigated how prior seizure preconditioning affects the miRNA response to status epilepticus evoked by intra-amygdalar kainic acid in mice. Increased miR-132 levels were matched with increased binding to Argonaute-2, a constituent of the RNA-induced silencing complex. In tolerant animals, expression responses of >40% of the injury-group-detected miRNAs differed, being either unchanged relative to control or down-regulated, and this included miR-132. In vivo microinjection of locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotides (antagomirs) against miR-132 depleted hippocampal miR-132 levels and reduced seizure-induced neuronal death. Thus, our data strongly suggest that miRNAs are important regulators of seizure-induced neuronal death. Preconditioning describes the ischemic stimulus that triggers an endogenous, neuroprotective response that protects the brain during a subsequent severe ischemic injury, a phenomenon known as 'tolerance'. Downregulation of miR-132 is consistent with our finding that preconditioning ischemia induces a rapid increase in MeCP2 protein, but not mRNA, in mouse cortex. These studies reveal that ischemic preconditioning regulates expression of miRNAs and their predicted targets in mouse brain cortex, and further suggest that miRNAs and MeCP2 could serve as effectors of ischemic preconditioning-induced tolerance. Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD. Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice. transgenic HD mice have abnormal miRNA biogenesis. This information should aid in future studies on therapeutic application of miRNAs in HD. miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies. reports of microRNA (miR) modulators of both neuronal and immune processes (here termed NeurimmiRs) predict therapeutic potential for manipulating NeurimmiR levels in diseases affecting both the immune system and higher brain functions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and anxiety-related disorders. In our opinion, NeurimmiRs that function within both the nervous and the immune systems, such as miR-132 and miR-124, may act as 'negotiators' between these two interacting compartments."
Is the protein FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) phosphorylated?,yes,"Overexpression of NEDD9 led to tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and SRC oncoproteins,  yrosine phosphorylated FAK TNFα contributes for attenuating both Y397FAK and Y416Src phosphorylations in osteoblasts.  It was possible to show that TNFα provokes attenuation at Y-phosphorylation of both FAK (at Y397 ) ownregulation of G3BP significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Src, FAK Periodic mechanical stress significantly induced sustained phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr(397) and Tyr(576/577).  oss of αSNAP impaired Golgi-dependent glycosylation and trafficking of β1 integrin and decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin resulting in FA disassembly. functional characterization of many of today's best-known Src substrates (for example, p85-Cortactin, p110-AFAP1, p130Cas, p125FAK and p120-catenin) Western blots were used for P-FAK e first time, that the EGF-dependent EGFR activation led to increased P-FAKSer732 . P-FAKSer732 presence was crucial for the maintenance of the proliferation rate and its levels were inversely related to the levels of acetylated α-tubulin. P-FAKSer732 localized at the microtubules (MTs) of the spindle, biochemically associated with MTs and contributed to MT depolymerization. specially, phosphorylation of Tyr925-FAK that is required for full activation of FAK was nearly completely suppressed even with 1nM of methyl violet 2B in A375P cancer cells.   The protein expression of PTPN13, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated FAK (P-FAK) was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. Curcumin inhibits focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and enhances the expressions of several extracellular matrix components which play a critical role in invasion and metastasis.  uppressed both the phosphorylation of FAK   A GEF-inactive Rgnef mutant rescues FAK-Y397 phosphorylation"
Does ghrelin play a role in ischemic stroke?,yes,"Recent evidence suggests that ghrelin may also be neuroprotective after injury in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Overall, these experiments point to a neurodegenerative but antiapoptotic effect of endogenous ghrelin in this model of global ischemia, highlighting that further research is essential before we can apply ghrelin treatments to neurodegenerative insults in the clinic.  The serum ghrelin level was higher in the MCAO group when compared with the control group (P < 0.05).  Our results showed that higher level of serum ghrelin decreased gastrointestinal motility and damage to the intestinal mucosa existed in rats with MCAO. Leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin, new potential mediators of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin and ghrelin were confirmed in the stroke group. Ghrelin levels correlated mildly with triglyceride levels, and were dominant in men with cardioembolic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Adipokines and ghrelin play an important role in ischemic stroke, but their function in stroke subtypes seems to be different and sex influenced. Ghrelin suppresses inflammation and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in focal cerebral ischemia via the vagus nerve. Compared with vehicle treatment, human ghrelin treatment in vagus nerve-intact rats after MCAO showed marked reduction in neurological deficit by 57% and infarct size by 25%.  Human ghrelin treatment in vagus nerve-intact rats significantly decreased the above measurements. Human ghrelin treatment also improved 7-day survival and significantly decreased neurological deficit over the entire 7 days after MCAO in vagus nerve-intact rats compared with vehicle.  Human ghrelin is thus a neuroprotective agent that inhibits inflammation, nNOS activity, and apoptosis in focal cerebral ischemia through a vagal pathway. Ghrelin is known to promote neuronal defense and survival against ischemic injury by inhibiting apoptotic processes.  Our data indicate that des-acyl ghrelin, as well as ghrelin, protect cortical neurons against ischemic injury through the inhibition of Par-4 expression and apoptotic molecules in mitochondrial pathway. In conclusion, it is considered that ghrelin as well as S-100B can be a useful marker for the prediction of stoke after CPB.  Adipokines and ghrelin play an important role in ischemic stroke, but their function in stroke subtypes seems to be different and sex influenced. In this review we discuss pre-clinical evidence suggesting ghrelin may be a useful therapeutic in protecting the brain against injury after ischemic stroke. Both ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin protected cortical neurons from ischemic injury. Our data indicate that des-acyl ghrelin, as well as ghrelin, protect cortical neurons against ischemic injury through the inhibition of Par-4 expression and apoptotic molecules in mitochondrial pathway. Adipokines and ghrelin play an important role in ischemic stroke, but their function in stroke subtypes seems to be different and sex influenced.

Is Achondroplasia associated with hearing loss?,yes,"A hearing screening program was performed to determine the prevalence of hearing loss and abnormal tympanometry in individuals with short-stature skeletal dysplasias attending a national meeting. Behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic emission testing, and tympanometry were used to assess hearing. Failed hearing screen was defined as hearing ≥ 35 dB at one or more frequencies or by ""fail"" on otoacoustic emissions. One hundred ten of 112 subjects completed the screening. 58 (51.8%) were children. Seventy-three (65.2%) had achondroplasia, 34 (30.4%) had one of 11 other diagnoses, and 5(4.4%) were undiagnosed. 25.8% of children failed hearing screening in one or both ears, while 46.3% of adults failed in one or both ears. 55.1% of adults and 25.0% of children with achondroplasia failed screening. Forty-four children had achondroplasia, and 31 had normal hearing in both ears (71%); 8 failed hearing screening in 1 ear (18%), and 3 in both ears (7%). Tympanometry was performed in 45 children, with normal tympanograms found in 21 (47%), bilateral abnormal tympanograms in 15 (33%), and unilateral abnormal tympanograms in 9 (20%). Fourteen children with achondroplasia had normal tympanograms (42%); 11 had bilateral abnormal tympanograms (33%); and 8 had unilateral abnormal tympanograms (24%). For those children without functioning tympanostomy tubes, there was a 9.5 times greater odds of hearing loss if there was abnormal tympanometry (P = .03). Achondroplasia (MIM 100800) is the most common non-lethal skeletal dysplasia. Its incidence is between one in 10,000 and one in 30,000. The phenotype is characterized by rhizomelic disproportionate short stature, enlarged head, midface hypoplasia, short hands and lordotic lumbar spine, associated with normal cognitive development. This autosomal-dominant disorder is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the type 3 receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGFR3); in more than 95% of cases, the mutation is G380R. The diagnosis is suspected on physical examination and confirmed by different age-related radiological features. Anticipatory and management care by a multidisciplinary team will prevent and treat complications, including cervical cord compression, conductive hearing loss and thoracolumbar gibbosity. The report includes information on otitis media, ventilation tubes, hearing loss, tonsillectomy, speech problems, tibial bowing and osteotomy, ventricular shunting, apnoea, cervicomedullary decompression, and neurological signs attributable to spinal stenosis. We conclude that verbal comprehension is significantly impaired in children with achondroplasia. This partial deficiency is probably related to frequent middle ear infections and resulting conductive hearing loss. In order to determine whether these morphologic changes are the cause of the hearing deficit in achondroplasia, audiometric studies and ENT evaluation were performed in eight of the nine patients. Audiograms were obtained in six of the nine achondroplastic subjects (two adults and four children). There was evidence of mixed hearing loss in the four children, but only of sensorineural hearing loss in the adults. We believe that the persistent hearing loss in achondroplasia is not due to sequelae of otitis media as some authors have suggested.  The AA report a clinical and radiological study performed in 18 achondroplastic patients in order to achieve a nosological settlement of the otological impairments."
Isn't RIP1 (RIP-1) part of the necrosome?,no,"formation of a different necrosome whose components, besides RIP1 and RIP3, are still unknown necrosome complex consisting of RIP1, RIP3, FADD, caspase-8 and cFLIP(L). assembly of a supramolecular complex containing the receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIP1 and RIP3) that delivers a pronecrotic signal. Such complex has recently been dubbed necrosome Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1/RIP1) and RIP3 are key components of the necrosome.  The phosphorylation of RIP1 and RIP3 is critical for assembly of the necrosome, RIP1-RIP3 ""necrosome"" complex  RIP1 and RIP3 mediate necrosome aggregation leading to the formation of amyloid-like signaling complexes.

Is the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for Rheumatoid Arthritis?,yes,"Combined longitudinal analysis of the 2 cohorts suggests further association of several loci with Larsen score (KIF5A, PTPN22, AFF3, TAGAP) and therefore a significant accumulation of RA severity markers among RA susceptibility markers (p = 0.016) A non-intronic marker at TNFAIP3, GIN1/C5orf30, STAT4, ANKRD55/IL6ST, BLK and PTPN22 showed association with RA susceptibility, irrespective of the serological status, the latter three markers remaining significantly associated with anti-CCP negative RA, after correction for multiple testing A C-to-T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 1858 of human PTPN22 cDNA and converting an arginine (R620) to tryptophan (W620) confers the highest risk of rheumatoid arthritis among non-HLA genetic variations that are known to be associated with this disease In addition, how the overall activity of PTPN22 is regulated and how the R-to-W conversion contributes to rheumatoid arthritis is still poorly understood Our data depict a model that can reconcile the conflicting observations on the functional impact of the C1858T SNP and also suggest that PTPN22.6 is a novel biomarker of rheumatoid arthritis. Lack of association of common variants in PTPN22 with RA in Han Chinese was confirmed This study identifies MMEL1 and CTLA4 as RA susceptibility genes, provides suggestive evidence of association for a further six loci in the Han Chinese population and confirms lack of PTPN22 association in Asian populations PTPN22 R620W genotype-phenotype correlation analysis and gene-environment interaction study in early rheumatoid arthritis: results from the ESPOIR cohort  PTPN22 620W risk allele was associated with ACPA production [odds ratio (OR) = 2.21, 95% CI 1.4, 3.4, P < 0.0001] Hormonal treatment exposition and smoking were found to act with a protective effect against ACPA production (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.3, 0.7, P = 0.001) and early bone erosion (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.4-0.8, P = 0.003), respectively, and independently of HLADR and PTPN22 status  RA patients (n=333) and controls (n=490) from the Cree/Ojibway NAN population in Central Canada were HLA-DRB1 typed and tested for 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have previously been associated with RA, including PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, CTLA4, PADI4, STAT4, FCRL3, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, KIF5A-PIP4K2C, IL2RB, TNFAIP3, IL10-1082G/A and REL Several other genes, including PTPN22 and PADI4, show modest association with RA Other variants in potentially pathogenic genes located in non-MHC regions have been implicated by recently performed genome wide analysis studies. These genes include PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, PADI4, STAT4 Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance. HLA-DRB1 and the R620W single-nucleotide polymorphism of PTPN22 were genotyped In addition, evidence of a significant interaction between the shared epitope and the risk allele of PTPN22 was observed only in these patients Although SNPs in PADI4 had similar allele frequency among three groups [maximal difference 11%; (P >0.05)], the other three loci revealed statistically significant allele frequency differences (maximal difference 39% (P <0.00001), 13% (P <0.00001), and 8% (P <0.00001) in SLC22A4, PDCD1, and PTPN22, respectively) Several multiple, large-scale, genetic studies on autoimmune-disease-associated SNPs have been reported recently: peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); solute carrier family 22 members 4 and 5 (SLC22A4 and 5) in RA and Crohn's disease (CD); programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and RA; and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) in T1D, RA, and SLE  Recently a number of convincing candidate genes have begun to emerge and an update has been provided for three of these: PTPN22, CTLA-4 and MIF. Association studies support a role for several genes, including TNFR2, PADI4, SLC22A4, RUNX1, and PTPN22 Analyses of families with multiple autoimmune disorders have revealed a functional polymorphism, 620W, in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPN22 as a predisposing factor for type 1 diabetes, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, and the presence of the PTPN22 protein appears to herald the development of autoantibodies in these disorders Replication of putative candidate-gene associations with rheumatoid arthritis in >4,000 samples from North America and Sweden: association of susceptibility with PTPN22, CTLA4, and PADI4. We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P=.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples.  Exploration of our data set with clinically relevant subsets of RA reveals that PTPN22 is associated with an earlier age at disease onset (P=.004) and that PTPN22 has a stronger effect in males than in females (P=.03)  Given the strong statistical power to replicate a true-positive association in this study, our results provide support for PTPN22, CTLA4, and PADI4 as RA susceptibility genes and demonstrate novel associations with clinically relevant subsets of RA In logistic regression analysis, ACPA predicted RA-development independent of PTPN22, while the PTPN22 polymorphism had no independent effect. Risk of progression from undifferentiated arthritis to rheumatoid arthritis: the effect of the PTPN22 1858T-allele in anti-citrullinated peptide antibody positive patients Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and the C1858T missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PTPN22 gene are both associated with the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Associations between human leukocyte antigen, PTPN22, CTLA4 genotypes and rheumatoid arthritis phenotypes of autoantibody status, age at diagnosis and erosions in a large cohort study HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (HLA-SE), PTPN22 and CTLA4 alleles are associated with cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Auto-antibodies, HLA and PTPN22: susceptibility markers for rheumatoid arthritis The combination of the PTPN22 1858T variant and anti-CCP antibodies gave a high specificity for the disease, and was significantly associated with RA (P = 8.86 x 10(-5), OR 10.05, 95% CI 1.88-53.73) The combination of the T variant of the 1858 polymorphism of the PTPN22 gene in combination with the presence of anti-CCP antibodies, preferentially in a SE-positive individual, is associated with the development of RA No association of the PTPN22 gene with mortality was detected Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association of the HLA-DRB1 (including the shared epitope [SE]) and PTPN22 genes with the risk of death from all causes and from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to assess the interactions between SE, smoking, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) status, adjusted by age at symptom onset and sex The disease association of the common 1858C>T Arg620Trp (rs2476601) nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of protein tyrosine phosphatase; nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) on chromosome 1p13 has been confirmed in type 1 diabetes and also in other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and Graves' disease To evaluate the predictive values for disease progression of various antibodies against citrullinated peptide proteins (ACPA) and their relation to PTPN22 1858C/T polymorphism and HLA-DRB1 alleles in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) PTPN22, PADI-4, and CTLA-4 have been associated with risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) A significant multiplicative interaction between PTPN22 and smoking for more than 10 pack-years was observed (P = 0.04) No gene-gene interaction was observed between PTPN22 and HLA-SE After adjusting for smoking and reproductive factors, PTPN22 was associated with RA risk among Caucasian women in these cohorts. We found both additive and multiplicative interactions between PTPN22 and heavy cigarette smoking. Weak evidence for an effect at the PTPN22 locus was also observed Association of the PTPN22 gene (-1123G > C) polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese patients These data suggest, the CC genotype and C allele of the -1123G > C in the PTPN22 gene are associated with an increased risk for RA in Chinese population Therefore, the CC genotype and C allele of the -1123G > C in the PTPN22 gene may be used as a genetic marker for the predisposition of RA in Chines A longer duration of breastfeeding increased the risk of developing RA, especially among individuals seropositive for ACPA or IgM-RF or carrying the PTPN22 1858T variant In a multiple logistic regression analysis, increasing time of breastfeeding (OR 9.5, 95% CI 2.14-42.43 for ≥ 17 months), seropositivity for ACPAs (OR 19.5, 95% CI 4.47-84.81), and carriage of the PTPN22 1858T variant (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.36-7.54) remained significant predictors of RA After quality control, 3209 patients and 3692 controls were included in the study. Eight markers (ie, rs1160542 (AFF3), rs1678542 (KIF5A), rs2476601 (PTPN22), rs3087243 (CTLA4), rs4810485 (CD40), rs5029937 (6q23), rs10760130 (TRAF1/C5) and rs7574865 (STAT4)) were significantly associated with RA by meta-analysis Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on RA identified known and novel susceptibility genes like HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1/C5, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, CD40, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, IL2RB, and KIF5A-PIP4K2C In the total RA inception cohort, the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, trend P < 0.0001), PTPN22 (per-allele OR = 1.5, trend P < 0.0001), OLIG3/TNFAIP3 locus (per-allele OR = 1.2, trend P = 0.009) and TRAF1/C5 locus (per-allele OR = 1.1, trend P = 0.04) were associated with RA Progress has been made in determining the relative contributions and the interaction of the shared epitope, PTPN22 and smoking in conferring the risk of anticitrullinated protein antibodies-positive and negative RA Homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the PTPN22 1858T allele had a decreased probability of remission Our analyses have confirmed previous findings for genes PTPN22 and C5 Fifty-five percent of the FDRs had > or =1 copy of the shared epitope, 20% had > or =1 copy of the PTPN22 polymorphism, and approximately 16% were positive for rheumatoid factor (RF; including isotypes) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody As an effect several new genes have been recognized as an HLA-independent genetic risk factors of RA. PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors, whereas STAT 4, CTLA4, PADI4 and IRF5 genes polymorphisms are listed among probable RA development genetic risk factors Patients were analysed for anti-MCV and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), and were genotyped for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 ""shared epitope"" (SE) and protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) 1858T As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA However, we were able to replicate the association signals between RA and HLA-DRB1 alleles, STAT4 (rs7574865), PTPN22 (rs2476601) and OLIG3/TNFAIP3 (rs10499194 and rs6920220) Additionally, SNPs rs7574865STAT4 (P = 9.2*10-6; OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.35 - 2.18) and rs2476601PTPN22 (P = 9.5*10-4; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.23 - 2.26) were associated with susceptibility to RA, whereas after permutation testing OLIG3/TNFAIP3 SNPs rs10499194 and rs6920220 missed our criteria for significance (Pcorr = 0.114 and Pcorr = 0.180, respectively In our Slovak population, HLA-DRB1 alleles as well as SNPs in STAT4 and PTPN22 genes showed a strong association with RA Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically Genetic markers such as shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T variant increase the relative risk for disease development Particularly, ACPAs in combination with human leukocyte antigen-shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T carriage increased the relative risks of developing RA compared with not having these factors However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA Functional polymorphisms of PTPN22 and FcgR genes in Tunisian patients with rheumatoid arthritis We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 620W allele and RA In conclusion, we have confirmed that PTPN22 620W allele is associated with Tunisian RA but does not constitute a factor influencing clinical manifestations The C1858T allele of the PTPN22 gene has been reported to confer risk for RA Similarly, the presence or absence of the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope or the RA-associated PTPN22 allele had no influence on this association Although some genetic risk factors for RA are well-established, most notably HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22, these markers do not fully account for the observed heritability Lastly, in combination with the other two known genetic risk factors, HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22, the variants reported here generate more than a 45-fold RA-risk differential Contribution of PTPN22 1858T, TNFRII 196R and HLA-shared epitope alleles with rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies to very early rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis PTPN22 1858T, TNFRII 196R and HLA-SE alleles do not improve the predictive value of RF and ACPA for RA diagnosis in our cohort, and do not contribute to an earlier diagnosis in undifferentiated patients initially negative for RF and ACPA"
Isn't marijuana use associated with increased risk for stroke?,no,"The illicit drugs more commonly associated with stroke are psychomotor stimulants, such as amphetamine and cocaine. Less commonly implicated are opioids and psychotomimetic drugs, including cannabis. Among 326 patients (184 males), the most frequent stroke risk factors overall were dyslipidaemia (187), smoking (161), hypertension (105) and obesity (92). Fifty-one patients used illicit drugs, mostly comprising marijuana and amphetamines. Patients in Adelaide are more likely to be obese, to be misusing marijuana and amphetamines, to suffer a cardioembolic event and to have a stroke that concurrently affects both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. RCVS was spontaneous in 37% of patients and secondary in the 63% others, to postpartum in 5 and to exposure to various vasoactive substances in 37, mainly cannabis, selective serotonin-recapture inhibitors and nasal decongestants. We reported two cases of young stroke associated with drug misuse. Case 1 used amphetamine, cocaine, marijuana and LSD for few yaers, and developed occlusion of a middle cerebral artery. Case 2 presented aphasia shortly after marijuana smoking. Marijuana may have accelerated stroke onset, but essential cause of stroke in this case must be protein S mutation. Cannabis is the most widely consumed among the illicit drugs worldwide, but it has only exceptionally been associated to cerebrovascular disease. We here describe 2 young patients (26 and 29 years, respectively) who suffered from ischemic stroke in temporal relation with cannabis consumption. The review of the literature on this topic reveals another 18 patients with stroke in association to cannabis use. Although a causal relationship is difficult to establish due to the widespread use of cannabis, this drug may play an etiologic role in ischemic stroke. Marijuana may trigger a myocardial infarction and have a vasospastic effect. Despite the fact that cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug, there are only a few reports associating its use with cerebrovascular disease. We describe a patient who suffered three ischaemic strokes immediately after cannabis consumption. Cannabis use may be associated with ischaemic stroke in young patients, but its mechanism is unclear. A right occipital ischemic stroke occurred in a 37-year-old Albanese man with a previously uneventful medical history, 15 min after having smoked a cigarette with approximately 250 mg of marijuana. Therefore, as the family history for cerebrovascular events, blood pressure, clotting tests, examinations for thrombophilia, vasculitis, extracranial and intracranial arteries and cardiac investigations were normal or respectively negative, the stroke was attributed to the chronic cannabis consumption. Three adolescent males had similar presentations of headache, fluctuating level of consciousness or lethargy, visual disturbance, and variable ataxia after self-administration of marijuana. Episodic marijuana use may represent a risk factor for stroke in childhood, particularly in the posterior circulation. Although several mechanisms exist by which marijuana use might contribute to the development of chronic cardiovascular conditions or acutely trigger cardiovascular events, there are few data regarding marijuana/THC use and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Reported here is the case of a previously healthy young man who smoked marijuana on a daily basis and had an occipital lobe stroke; he was found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden. This case suggests that marijuana smoking may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis in otherwise healthy individuals who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden. Thus, chronic abuse of marijuana might be a risk factor for stroke. A 22-year-old man with a five-year history of drug and alcohol abuse presented with a left hemiparesis preceded by three transient ischaemic attacks, two of which occurred whilst smoking cannabis. Substance abuse was the only identifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF. Research directions might include more studies of cardiovascular disease outcomes and relationships of marijuana with cardiovascular risk factors, studies of metabolic and physiologic effects of chronic marijuana use that may affect cardiovascular disease risk, increased understanding of the role of the cannabinoid receptor system in cardiovascular regulation, and studies to determine if there is a therapeutic role for cannabinoids in blood pressure control or for neuroprotection after stroke."

Aren't mutations in the STXBP1 gene associated with epilepsy?,no,"Folinic acid responsive epilepsy in Ohtahara syndrome caused by STXBP1 mutation. A novel mutation in STXBP1 gene in a child with epileptic encephalopathy and an atypical electroclinical pattern. Mutations in STXBP1 gene, encoding the syntaxin binding protein 1, have been recently described in Ohtahara syndrome, or early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern, and in other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies. STXBP1 (MUNC18.1), encoding syntaxin binding protein 1, has been reported in Ohtahara syndrome, a rare epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst pattern on EEG, in patients with infantile spasms and in a few patients with nonsyndromic mental retardation without epilepsy.  ed with severe developmental delay and poor prognosis. Mutations and deletions in the STXBP1 gene are associated with Ohtahara syndrome, also known as ""early infantile epileptic encephalopathy Here we show that de novo heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding STXBP1, also known as MUNC18-1, which is essential in synaptic vesicle release in multiple species, cause OS STXBP1 haploinsufficiency results in progressive encephalopathy characterized by intellectual disability and may be accompanied by epilepsy, movement disorders, and autism.  Mutations of the syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) have been associated with severe infantile epileptic encephalopathies (Ohtahara syndrome and West syndrome), but also with moderate to severe cognitive impairment and nonsyndromic epilepsy. A novel STXBP1 mutation causes focal seizures with neonatal onset. STXBP1 mutations in early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern. e novo STXBP1 mutations have been found in individuals with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern (EIEE) Mutations in STXBP1 are relatively frequent in patients with infantile epileptic encephalopathies. STXBP1-related encephalopathy may present as drug-responsive infantile spasms with focal/lateralized discharges. De novo SCN1A mutations in migrating partial seizures of infancy. De novo mutations in the gene encoding STXBP1 (MUNC18-1) cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Mutations in STXBP1 have been identified in a subset of patients with early onset epileptic encephalopathy (EE), but the full phenotypic spectrum remains to be delineated and STXBP1-related West/Ohtahara syndromes, are due to a mutation in a unique gene. This is the first case report showing that STXBP1 mutations caused West syndrome from the onset of epilepsy."
Is mitofusin 2 a receptor for parkin?,yes,Recent work demonstrates that a phosphorylated form of the mitochondrial fusion protein Mitofusin 2 serves as a receptor for Parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria. We show that the mitochondrial outer membrane guanosine triphosphatase mitofusin (Mfn) 2 mediates Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria.  Mfn2 functions as a mitochondrial receptor for Parkin and is required for quality control of cardiac mitochondria. Mitofusin 1 and mitofusin 2 are ubiquitinated in a PINK1/parkin-dependent manner upon induction of mitophagy
Is there a relationship between thyroid hormone altered metabolism and coronary artery disease?,yes,"The results showed that higher levels of TSH within the reference range were independently associated with the presence of CAD only among subjects less than or equal to 65 years old, suggesting age might influence the relationship. FT3 levels within the normal range were inversely correlated with the presence and severity of CAD. Moreover, lower FT3 concentrations were correlated with the Gensini score and independently predicted the presence and severity of CAD. High TSH within the reference range was associated with increased risk of coronary death in women (P(trend) 0·005), but not in men. The risk of coronary death was also increased among women with subclinical hypothyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism, compared to women with TSH of 0·50-1·4 mU/l.   Prevalence of CHD was more common in hypothyroid and moderate SCH patients. The angiographic results were as follows: significant coronary disease (SH 28.1% vs. non-SH 43.8%; p=0.087); three-vessel disease (9.4% vs. 9.9%; p=0.919); two-vessel disease (12.5% vs. 13.4%; p=0.892); single-vessel disease (6.3% vs. 29.5%; p=0.051); minimal lesions (9.4% vs. 10.9%; p=0.794); and no coronary disease (62.4% vs, 45.3%; p=0.064). Lower fT3 levels were predictive of both single-vessel (p = 0.012) and multivessel (p = 0.009) CAD. Through a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fT3 was still linked to the presence of CAD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.68, p < 0.001). Our study showed that FT(4) levels were associated with the presence and the severity of CAD. Also, this study suggests that elevated serum FT(4) levels even within normal range could be a risk factor for CAD.  The present meta-analysis indicates that sub-clinical hypothyroidism is associated with both, a significant risk of CHD at baseline and at follow-up. The incidence of multi-vessel disease was higher in patients with high TSH level (p=0.026). TSH level showed a significant correlation with age (r=0.109, p=0.044) and Gensini's score (r=0.117, p=0.045). The multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR 2.39, p=0.001), diabetes (OR 3.74, p=0.001), creatinine (OR 2.06, p=0.008), and smoking (OR 1.85, p=0.045) were independent predictors for significant coronary artery disease, but TSH level did not predict coronary artery stenosis. These data in patients referred for coronary angiography suggest that variation of thyroid function within the statistical normal range may influence the presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis."
Is Thalidomide currently a marketed drug?,yes,"In this retrospective study, pharmacy claims were analyzed for those patients with a diagnosis of MM who received thalidomide, The Japanese POEMS syndrome with Thalidomide (J-POST) Trial is a phase II/III multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with thalidomide in POEMS syndrome, Thalidomide could relieve clinical symptoms and intestinal mucosal lesions effectively in children with refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from the pre-clinical study.

Could BRCA gene test used for breast and ovarian cancer risk?,yes,"Participation of Korean families at high risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2 genetic testing. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients irrespective of the family history was significantly higher than previously reported. Possible founder mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients were identified. Germline Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Korean Ovarian Cancer Patients: Finding Founder Mutations. The assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences to identify pathogenic mutations associated with inherited breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has provided a method to identify high-risk individuals, allowing them to seek preventative treatments and strategies.  Maximising survival: the main concern of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer who undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time. The strongest evidence was for rs1466785 in the NEIL2 (endonuclease VIII-like 2) gene (HR: 1.09, 95% CI (1.03-1.16), p = 2.7 × 10(-3)) for association with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, and rs2304277 in the OGG1 (8-guanine DNA glycosylase) gene, with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR: 1.12 95%CI: 1.03-1.21, p = 4.8 × 10(-3)). Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility.  Large BRCA1 and BRCA2 genomic rearrangements in Polish high-risk breast and ovarian cancer families. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two major genes associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. Until 2006, she supervised a diagnostic unit for BRCA gene testing at the Interdisciplinary Center for Hereditary Breast Cancer (Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany).  Inherited BRCA gene mutations convey a high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but current guidelines limit BRCA mutation testing to women with early-onset cancer and relatives of mutation-positive cases.  Women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation face a risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer at an earlier age than women without such a mutation. In 2006, participants were recruited from Web sites for women with breast cancer or BRCA gene mutations.  About 20 % of hereditary breast cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be spread throughout the gene, genetic testing is usually performed by direct sequencing of entire coding regions. Suggestion of an association between BRCA2 c.7806-2A>G and risk of breast cancer in males has emerged.  The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers.  OBJECTIVE: Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. BACKGROUND: Women who are diagnosed with a deleterious mutation in either breast cancer (BRCA) gene have a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers at young ages. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. [Detection and occurrence of BRCA 1 gene mutation in patients with carcinoma of the breast and ovary]. We investigated the relationship between BRCA mutations and the distribution of familial cancers other than breast or ovary in high-risk breast cancer patients.PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WERE ENROLLED: reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer; 40 years of age or younger age at diagnosis; bilateral breast cancer; or male gender Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are associated with increased risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer.To review new evidence on the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women.MEDLINE and PsycINFO between 2004 and 30 July 2013, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2004 through the second quarter of 2013, Health Technology Assessment during the fourth quarter of 2012, Scopus, and reference lists.English-language studies about accuracy of risk assessment and benefits and harms of genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce cancer incidence and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of primary breast cancer (PBC) and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) in patients who had BRCA1/BRCA2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer (OC).From the database of the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic, patients who had BRCA-associated OC without a history of unilateral breast cancer (BC) (at risk of PBC; n = 79) or with a history of unilateral BC (at risk of CBC; n = 37) were selected Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery.This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer.The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) If a woman bearing a mutation develops cancer in one breast, her risk of developing cancer in the other breast depends on the particular gene that is mutated and on her age at the onset of disease.About half of all monogenically determined carcinomas of the breast and ovary are due to a mutation in one or the other of the highly penetrant BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk.Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.Breast and ovarian cancer risks.Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46%) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12%) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5%) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37%) without cancer This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.METHODS: A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries. Women with a harmful mutation in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene are at significantly increased risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) during their lifetime, compared to those without. Genetic testing for BRCA genes, associated with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer risk, is an accepted cancer control strategy. Younger patients, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be BRCA tested. Mutations in BRCA genes elevate risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers.No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete.A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For each proband, the pre-test probability of identifying a deleterious BRCA mutation was estimated using the Myriad II model. We identified 108 affected individuals who underwent large rearrangement testing (80 breast cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, nine both breast and ovarian cancer). Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. One asymptomatic person--carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation--was identified in this study. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Identification of BRCA mutations greatly improves the preventive strategies and management of breast cancer. Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.CONCLUSIONS: Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations. Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. However, some single risk factors without family histories (early-onset breast cancer, male breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers) may limit the utility of BRCA gene testing in the Korean population. BRCA Mutations Increase Fertility in Families at Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Risk. Because infertility is associated with breast and ovarian cancer risks, we hypothesized that the mutations in the BRCA gene may be associated with low response to fertility treatments. Moreover, in families of breast cancer patients without BRCA mutations, breast cancer risk depends on the patient's age at diagnosis. Among the 554 women who underwent genetic testing for BRCA mutation, 78 were found to have a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 gene, and 54 had a mutation in the BRCA 2 gene. Frequent recurrent mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Hispanics, including a large rearrangement Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 exon 9-12 deletion [ex9-12del]), suggest that an ancestry-informed BRCA-testing strategy could reduce disparities and promote cancer prevention by enabling economic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Mexico. Individuals who carry a BRCA gene mutation have increased lifetime risks of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome-related cancers. BRCA gene mutations have been well described to carry an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer among 8,005 women from a breast cancer family history clinic: no increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer in families testing negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Women who were BRCA carriers, women who had a history of breast cancer, DCIS, or breast biopsy, or had a family history of ovarian cancer were more likely to have undergone surgery for cancer risk reduction. Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility became a reality after two cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were identified. Germline mutations in BRCA genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. We used person-years at risk to assess ovarian cancer rates in the study population, subdivided by genetic status (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA negative, BRCA untested) compared with the general population."
Couldn't BRCA gene test used for breast and ovarian cancer risk?,no,"Participation of Korean families at high risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2 genetic testing. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients irrespective of the family history was significantly higher than previously reported. Possible founder mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients were identified. Germline Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Korean Ovarian Cancer Patients: Finding Founder Mutations. The assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences to identify pathogenic mutations associated with inherited breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has provided a method to identify high-risk individuals, allowing them to seek preventative treatments and strategies.  Maximising survival: the main concern of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer who undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time. The strongest evidence was for rs1466785 in the NEIL2 (endonuclease VIII-like 2) gene (HR: 1.09, 95% CI (1.03-1.16), p = 2.7 × 10(-3)) for association with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, and rs2304277 in the OGG1 (8-guanine DNA glycosylase) gene, with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR: 1.12 95%CI: 1.03-1.21, p = 4.8 × 10(-3)). Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility.  Large BRCA1 and BRCA2 genomic rearrangements in Polish high-risk breast and ovarian cancer families. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two major genes associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. Until 2006, she supervised a diagnostic unit for BRCA gene testing at the Interdisciplinary Center for Hereditary Breast Cancer (Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany).  Inherited BRCA gene mutations convey a high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but current guidelines limit BRCA mutation testing to women with early-onset cancer and relatives of mutation-positive cases.  Women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation face a risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer at an earlier age than women without such a mutation. In 2006, participants were recruited from Web sites for women with breast cancer or BRCA gene mutations.  About 20 % of hereditary breast cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be spread throughout the gene, genetic testing is usually performed by direct sequencing of entire coding regions. Suggestion of an association between BRCA2 c.7806-2A>G and risk of breast cancer in males has emerged.  The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers.  OBJECTIVE: Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. BACKGROUND: Women who are diagnosed with a deleterious mutation in either breast cancer (BRCA) gene have a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers at young ages. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. [Detection and occurrence of BRCA 1 gene mutation in patients with carcinoma of the breast and ovary]. We investigated the relationship between BRCA mutations and the distribution of familial cancers other than breast or ovary in high-risk breast cancer patients.PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WERE ENROLLED: reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer; 40 years of age or younger age at diagnosis; bilateral breast cancer; or male gender Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are associated with increased risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer.To review new evidence on the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women.MEDLINE and PsycINFO between 2004 and 30 July 2013, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2004 through the second quarter of 2013, Health Technology Assessment during the fourth quarter of 2012, Scopus, and reference lists.English-language studies about accuracy of risk assessment and benefits and harms of genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce cancer incidence and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of primary breast cancer (PBC) and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) in patients who had BRCA1/BRCA2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer (OC).From the database of the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic, patients who had BRCA-associated OC without a history of unilateral breast cancer (BC) (at risk of PBC; n = 79) or with a history of unilateral BC (at risk of CBC; n = 37) were selected Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery.This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer.The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) If a woman bearing a mutation develops cancer in one breast, her risk of developing cancer in the other breast depends on the particular gene that is mutated and on her age at the onset of disease.About half of all monogenically determined carcinomas of the breast and ovary are due to a mutation in one or the other of the highly penetrant BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk.Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.Breast and ovarian cancer risks.Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46%) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12%) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5%) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37%) without cancer This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.METHODS: A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries. Women with a harmful mutation in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene are at significantly increased risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) during their lifetime, compared to those without. Genetic testing for BRCA genes, associated with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer risk, is an accepted cancer control strategy. Younger patients, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be BRCA tested. Mutations in BRCA genes elevate risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers.No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete.A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For each proband, the pre-test probability of identifying a deleterious BRCA mutation was estimated using the Myriad II model. We identified 108 affected individuals who underwent large rearrangement testing (80 breast cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, nine both breast and ovarian cancer). Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. One asymptomatic person--carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation--was identified in this study. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Identification of BRCA mutations greatly improves the preventive strategies and management of breast cancer. Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.CONCLUSIONS: Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations. Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. However, some single risk factors without family histories (early-onset breast cancer, male breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers) may limit the utility of BRCA gene testing in the Korean population.

Isn't the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum always deadly?,yes,"Animals treated with trace elements recovered. It appears that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and trace element deficiency could explain the extensive emergence of chronic Botulism. The patient was treated with human botulism immune globulin and had rapid recovery in weakness. A stool sample from the patient was positive for Type A Clostridium botulinum toxin eventually confirming the diagnosis of infant botulism The botulism immunoglobulin was administered, and a diagnosis was confirmed with positive botulinum toxin in the stool samples. Full recovery was made by the infant Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) serotype B (BoNT/B) is one of the serotypes of BoNT that causes deadly human botulism, though it is used clinically for treatment of many neuromuscular diseases. Foodborne botulism is a rare and sometimes fatal illness caused by consuming foods containing botulinum neurotoxin To assess the effectiveness and safety of botulinum toxin in treating MPS, excluding MPS in neck and head muscles. Botulinum toxin (BTX) is one of the most potent bacterial toxins known and its effectiveness in the treatment of some pain syndromes is well known.  An emerging treatment option to address these issues is the use of a paralyzing material such as botulinum toxin A (Botox) to decrease the appearance of the wrinkles, which yields a more esthetic and youthful facial appearanc lthough BoNT is an extremely toxic molecule, it is now increasingly used for the treatment of disorders related to muscle hyperactivity and glandular hyperactivity."
Is ocrelizumab effective for treatment of multiple sclerosis?,yes,"Advances made in immunomodulation are driving the progress being made in the treatment of MS. Ocrelizumab is the first treatment with positive results in the primarily progressive forms and tocilizumab, a drug product for rheumatoid arthritis, stands out as a potential candidate for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica.  Expert commentary: The recent encouraging results of the ocrelizumab trial in PP MS, the first to reach the primary disability endpoint, indicate B cells as a promising therapeutic target to prevent disease progression.  Ocrelizumab also shows efficacy in the primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Expert commentary: The topline results of two phase-III randomized clinical trials demonstrate superiority of ocrelizumab over interferon beta in RRMS patients with regards to clinical and paraclinical outcome parameters.  The efficacy of three of them, rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab in MS has been confirmed by placebo-controlled clinical trials demonstrating a significant reduction of the annualized relapsing rate (ARR), new gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) and T2 lesions.  Ongoing PMS trials are currently being conducted with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor ibudilast, S1P modulator siponimod and anti-B-cell therapy ocrelizumab.  RECENT FINDINGS: Novel and imminently emerging DMTs for the treatment of RRMS include alemtuzumab, daclizumab, ocrelizumab, pegylated interferon-β-1a, and three times weekly glatiramer acetate.  To summarize mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of novel and imminently emerging disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) intended to be used in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).Novel and imminently emerging DMTs for the treatment of RRMS include alemtuzumab, daclizumab, ocrelizumab, pegylated interferon-β-1a, and three times weekly glatiramer acetate Ocrelizumab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of two dose regimens of the humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  In multiple sclerosis (MS), B cell-depleting therapy using monoclonal anti-CD20 Abs, including rituximab (RTX) and ocrelizumab, effectively reduces disease activity.  Ocrelizumab also shows efficacy in the primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis.Most of the presented cell-depleting and myeloablative therapies are highly effective treatment options but are also accompanied by significant risks. The armamentarium of approved disease-modifying therapies in MS and those in development include: (1) the first approved, moderately effective, injectable interferon-β and glatiramer acetate; (2) oral drugs (fingolimod, laquinimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate); (3) monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, daclizumab, alemtuzumab); and (4) immunosuppressive agents (e.g. mitoxantrone). BACKGROUND: B lymphocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of two dose regimens of the humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 79 centres in 20 countries.

Is NADPH oxidase 5 expressed in rodents?,no,"Because the Nox5 gene is absent in rodents, we generated transgenic mice expressing human Nox5 in a podocyte-specific manner (Nox5(pod+)).  The NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) gene is present in humans but not rodents.  The data document that the NOX5 gene was expressed in cells of lagomorphs unlike rodents, making the rabbit an interesting model to study NOX5 functions. Nox5 was lost in rodents, and Nox3, which functions in the inner ear in gravity perception, emerged the most recently, corresponding to full-time adaptation of vertebrates to land.  NOX expression patterns in animals are complex and ancestral NOXes, NOX5-like isoforms and DUOXes are generally found. But there are exceptions; for example rodents lack NOX5 and Caenorhabditis elegans expresses only DUOXes. The NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) gene is present in humans but not rodents.

Is RASA2 involved in melanoma?,yes,"Analysis of 501 melanoma exomes identified RASA2, encoding a RasGAP, as a tumor-suppressor gene mutated in 5% of melanomas. Recurrent loss-of-function mutations in RASA2 were found to increase RAS activation, melanoma cell growth and migration. RASA2 expression was lost in ≥30% of human melanomas and was associated with reduced patient survival. These findings identify RASA2 inactivation as a melanoma driver and highlight the importance of RasGAPs in cancer.

Is Migalastat used for treatment of Fabry Disease?,yes,"Oral pharmacological chaperone migalastat compared with enzyme replacement therapy in Fabry disease: 18-month results from the randomised phase III ATTRACT study. BACKGROUND: Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by GLA mutations, resulting in α-galactosidase (α-Gal) deficiency and accumulation of lysosomal substrates. Migalastat, an oral pharmacological chaperone being developed as an alternative to intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), stabilises specific mutant (amenable) forms of α-Gal to facilitate normal lysosomal trafficking.

Don't statins cause diabetes?,no,"Statin use has been associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and with impaired glycemic control in T2DM patients The relationship between T2DM and statins is further complicated since these drugs can cause new onset diabetes (NOD) although there is an overall benefit in terms of preventing vascular events  It has been repeatedly reported that statins may cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). However, a small, but significant risk of new-onset diabetes has been reported in patients treated with statins. The National Lipid Association (NLA) Statin Diabetes Safety Task Force concluded that the cardiovascular benefit of statin therapy outweighs the risk for developing diabetes It has been repeatedly reported that statins may cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) It has been repeatedly reported that statins may cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). However, limited evidence exists from direct head to head comparisons of statins on whether the risk of DM differs among statins. Short-term statin exposure is associated with reduced all-cause mortality in persons with diabetes. Despite the fact that higher statin doses are more likely to lead to new-onset diabetes, for every case of diabetes caused, there are approximately three cardiovascular events reduced with high dose versus moderate dose statin therapy. It has been repeatedly reported that statins may cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM).  Statins are evidence-based drugs to prevent cardiovascular (CV) disease. However, their benefits have been disputed by a statin-related increased risk of new onset diabetes  Compared with pravastatin, treatment with higher potency statins, especially atorvastatin and simvastatin, might be associated with an increased risk of new onset diabetes  statins are associated with a small increase in incidence of diabetes in patients predisposed to glycemic alteration  Higher potency statin use is associated with a moderate increase in the risk of new onset diabetes compared with lower potency statins in patients treated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease An increased risk of new onset treated diabetes was found in those treated with statins showing significant duration and dose effect Although most of the clinical studies suggest a worsening of insulin resistance and secretion, the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy outweigh the risk of developing insulin resistance, thus the data suggest the need to treat dyslipidemia and to make patients aware of the possible risk of developing type 2 diabetes or, if they already are diabetic, of worsening their metabolic control Statin therapy can slightly increase risk of incident diabetes in subjects with hypercholesterolemia."

Can beans induce apoptosis?,yes,"A 60-kDa glucosamine binding lectin, white kidney bean lectin (WKBL), was purified from Phaseolus vulgaris cv. white kidney beans, by application of anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, and FPLC-size exclusion on Superdex 75. The anti-proliferative activity of WKBL on HONE1 cells and HepG2 cells was stronger than the activity on MCF7 cells and WRL68 cells  Treatment of human stomach cancer KATO III cells with hot-water extracts from adzuki beans led to their growth inhibition as well as apoptosis induction. Stimulation of dendritic cell maturation and induction of apoptosis in leukemia cells by a heat-stable extract from azuki bean (Vigna angularis), a promising immunopotentiating food and dietary supplement for cancer prevention. Human gut flora-fermented nondigestible fraction from cooked bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) modifies protein expression associated with apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferation in human adenocarcinoma colon cancer cells. This paper reports the effect of fermentation products (FP) by hgf (FP-hgf) from NDF of cooked beans on survival and protein expression associated with apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferation in human adenocarcinoma colon cancer cells. PHA-E is a natural product extracted from red kidney beans, and it has been reported to induce cell apoptosis by blocking EGFR in lung cancer cells A Glucosamine-Specific Lectin from Green Dragon No. 8 Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) Induced Apoptosis on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells PHA-E is a natural product extracted from red kidney beans, and it has been reported to induce cell apoptosis by blocking EGFR in lung cancer cells. The anticancer activity of δ-tocotrienol, a bioactive vitamin E present in whole grain cereals, annatto beans and palm fruit, is strongly dependent on its effect on the induction of apoptosis. δ-Tocotrienol-induced apoptosis is associated with consistent induction in the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). NDF of cooked common beans inhibited colon carcinogenesis at an early stage by inducing cell cycle arrest of colon cells and morphological changes linked to apoptosis, thus confirming previous results obtained with gene expression studies. Azuki extract also inhibited the growth of human leukemia U937 cells, leading to induction of apoptosis. Fermentation product of soybean, black bean, and green bean mixture induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer cells. A non-digestible fraction of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis during early carcinogenesis."
Hasn't small pox been eradicated from the world?,no,"small pox has been eradicated. smallpox is now eradicated In May 1980 the World Health Assembly in Geneva announced in solemn form the world-wide eradication of the small-pox and gave recommendations to the member countries for concluding measures concerning the small-pox vaccination, the foundation of vaccine reserves and the control of the epidemiological situation in the world. As a result of vaccination, diseases such as polio and measles have been controlled and small pox has been eradicated Small pox eradication from the world is the perfect example of the role of mass vaccination of the entire community of the universe.  The French owe a lot to this Central Committee of Vaccine, which greatly contributed to fighting small pox and eradicating the disease finally. Small pox eradication from the world is the perfect example of the role of mass vaccination of the entire community of the universe. Also, the vaccine that Jenner used, which decreased the prevalence of Small Pox worldwide in his own time, and later was used to eradicate Small Pox altogether, is discussed in light of recent data.. the only known cases of smallpox happened from an outbreak in Birmingham, England caused by a laboratory accident in the year of 1979.

Couldn't plasmepsins be used as targets for developing anti-malaria drugs?,no,"Fighting malaria: structure-guided discovery of nonpeptidomimetic plasmepsin inhibitors. Given that the parasite needs the resulting amino acid building blocks for its growth and development, plasmepsins are an important antimalarial drug target.  Due to early crystallographic evidence, plasmepsin II (Plm II) emerged as well explored target to develop novel antimalarials as well as a starting point to develop inhibitors targeting some other subtypes of plasmepsins i.e. Plm I, II, IV and V. With the advancements in drug discovery, several computational and synthetic approaches were employed in order to develop novel inhibitors targeting Plm II.  Structural basis for plasmepsin V inhibition that blocks export of malaria proteins to human erythrocytes. Plasmepsin V, an essential aspartyl protease of malaria parasites, has a key role in the export of effector proteins to parasite-infected erythrocytes. Consequently, it is an important drug target for the two most virulent malaria parasites of humans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Plasmepsin V (PmV) is an essential Plasmodium protease and a highly promising antimalarial target, which still lacks molecular characterization and drug-like inhibitors. Our inhibitors act 'on-target', confirmed by cellular interference of PmV function and biochemical interaction with inhibitors.  Our work disclosed novel pursuable drug design strategies for highly efficient PmV inhibition highlighting novel molecular elements necessary for picomolar activity against PmV. All the presented data are discussed in respect to human aspartic proteases and previously reported inhibitors, highlighting differences and proposing new strategies for drug development. High binding likeness on antimalarial target plasmepsin was detected through molecular docking.  This provides the first direct evidence that PMV activity is essential for protein export in Plasmodium spp. and for parasite survival in human erythrocytes and validates PMV as an antimalarial drug target. The export mechanism involves the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL), which is a cleavage site for the parasite protease, Plasmepsin V (PMV).  Plasmepsin II (PM II) is an attractive target for anti-malaria drug discovery, which involves in host hemoglobin degradation in the acidic food vacuole. These methods are utilized to search for inhibitors of the aspartyl proteases, plasmepsin II and cathepsin D. Plasmepsin II, a protease found in the malaria parasite, hydrolyzes human hemoglobin, the nutrient source for the parasite and is a new target for anti-malaria therapy. Given recent advances in understanding the fundamental roles of the various plasmepsins, it is likely that the most effective antimalarial plasmepsin targets will be the non-digestive vacuole plasmepsins. Plasmepsins (PMs) are essential proteases of the plasmodia parasites and are therefore promising targets for developing drugs against malaria. Therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets. As inhibition of plasmepsins leads to the parasite's death, these enzymes can be utilized as potential drug targets. falciparum plasmepsins II and IV make structure-based drug design of antimalarial compounds that focus on inhibiting plasmepsins possible. The malarial parasite encodes two homologous aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, which are essential components of its hemoglobin-degradation pathway and are novel targets for antimalarial drug development. vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies. In P.falciparum, plasmepsins I, II, IV and HAP have been directly implicated in hemoglobin degradation during malaria infection, and are now considered targets for anti-malarial drug design. These results shed light on the role of V105 and T108 residues in plasmepsin specificities, and they should be useful in structure-based design of novel, selective inhibitors that may serve as antimalarial drugs. The aspartic proteases plasmepsins, whose inhibition leads to parasite death, are classified as targets for the design of potent drugs. A large compound library of about 1 million chemical compounds was docked on 5 different targets of plasmepsins using two different docking software, namely FlexX and AutoDock. Plasmodium aspartic proteases known as plasmepsins play an important role on haemoglobin degradation and are being studied as drug targets for chemotherapy of malaria. Our study revealed about 100 parasite-coded gene products that included many known drug targets such as Pf hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, Pf L-lactate dehydrogenase, and Plasmepsins. The two aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, from Plasmodium falciparum have recently emerged as potential targets. Plasmepsins are highly promising as drug targets, especially when combined with the inhibition of falcipains that are also involved in hemoglobin catabolism. Among such enzymes, Plasmepsins (aspartic proteases) and, especially, Falcipains (cysteine proteases) are highly promising antimalarial drug targets. The high sequence conservations between the plasmepsins from the isolates support the notion that the enzymes could be reliable targets for new antimalarial chemotherapeutics. Due to early crystallographic evidence, plasmepsin II (Plm II) emerged as well explored target to develop novel antimalarials as well as a starting point to develop inhibitors targeting some other subtypes of plasmepsins i.e. Plasmepsin, an aspartic protease, which is involved in the hemoglobin breakdown into smaller peptides emerged as a crucial target to develop new chemical entities to counter malaria. were employed in order to develop new chemical entities targeting Plm II. With the advancements in drug discovery, several computational and synthetic approaches were employed in order to develop novel inhibitors targeting Plm II. vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies.. We developed a potent inhibitor of plasmepsin V, called WEHI-842, which directly mimics the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL). In order to validate appropriate use of PM4 as potential anti-malarial drug target, studies on genetic and structural variations among P. Over the past decade, much effort has been placed towards developing plasmepsin inhibitors as antimalarial agents, particularly targeting the digestive vacuole."

Does NADPH oxidase 5 require any subunit for function?,no,"Nox5 forms a functional oligomer mediated by self-association of its dehydrogenase domain.  While Nox1-4 require regulatory subunits, including p22phox, Nox5 activity does not depend on any subunits.   Thus, Nox5 forms a catalytically active oligomer in the membrane that is mediated by its dehydrogenase domain.  Coexpression of specific Nox catalytic subunits (Nox1, Nox2, Nox3, Nox4, or Nox5) along with their corresponding regulatory subunits (NOXO1/NOXA1 for Nox1; p47phox/p67phox/Rac for Nox2; NOXO1 for Nox3; no subunits for Nox4 or Nox5) resulted in marked production of reactive oxygen."
Is NSD-1015 an inhibitor of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase?,yes,"When pretreated with a central AADC inhibitor (NSD-1015), further application of l-dopa failed to increase the motoneuron activity although the expression of DA in the AADC cells was not completely inhibited.  Inhibition of Ddc by AADC inhibitor NSD-1015 or anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) reduced brain volume and body length.

Neurochemical study of effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazol and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites in the brain structures of Wistar rat on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 To establish the neurotransmitter role(s) of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in its own right, we attempted to clarify whether i.p. injection of a DOPA antagonist, DOPA cyclohexyl ester (CHE), would antagonize the behavioral responses of conscious rats to DOPA in the presence of 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) (100 mg/kg i.p.), a central aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor. TH and TPH activities were determined in tissue extracts by measuring the accumulation of L-Dopa and 5-HTP respectively, following the administration of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015.  Results of a neurochemical study of the effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazole and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites determined by HPLC on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by NSD-1015 (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase) in the brain structures of Wistar rats are reported.  . When pretreated with a central AADC inhibitor (NSD-1015) NSD 1015 (general AADC inhibitor) monoamine synthesis blockade induced by NSD-1015 (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase)  the aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) inhibitor NSD-1015 An accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence of female rats treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), and inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) activity, was associated with a decreased concentration of dopamine in the median eminence and pronounced reduction in the release of dopamine into hypophysial portal blood. 6S-BH4 increased extracellular DOPA levels in the presence of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (an index of in vivo tyrosine hydroxylase activity), to an extent similar to the increase induced by 6R-BH4. 5-HT synthesis was estimated by measuring the accumulation of the 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), in the neurointermediate lobe of male Long-Evans rats following the administration of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Monoamine synthesis was studied in different parts of the brain by measuring the accumulated dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 30 min after NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine HCl, 100 mg/kg) an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase, given i.p. HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection was used to make concurrent measurements of the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine in selected brain regions (striatum, nucleus accumbens, septum, medial periventricular hypothalamus) and thoracic spinal cords of rats treated with NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase. The activity of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurons has been estimated from measurements of: concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid; the ratio of the concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to 5-hydroxytryptamine; the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan following the administration of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., NSD 1015); the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine, and the rate of decline of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid following the administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e.g., pargyline). The accumulation of dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) after administration of NSD 1015 to inhibit aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase was determined as an index of NE synthesis. The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats. The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD 1015 markedly increased the dopa concentration. Using a microdialysis technique, the rat striatum was perfused with NSD-1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, and the amount of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulating in dialysate was measured as an index of in vivo activities of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase. Also, we studied the effect of MnCl2 on extracellular levels of l-Dopa in the presence of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor 3-hydroxybencilhydracine-HCl (NSD 1015). The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats. An accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence of female rats treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), and inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) activity, was associated with a decreased concentration of dopamine in the median eminence and pronounced reduction in the release of dopamine into hypophysial portal blood.

The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats.  The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA.  Furthermore, the ethanol-induced enhancement of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation in the mesolimbic dopamine terminal area after NSD 1015 (an inhibitor of l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase) was completely antagonized by mecamylamine in doses (3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg) that exerted no effects per se. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) enhanced L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in both the corpus striatum and limbic areas (nucleus accumbens) after inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase with NSD-1015, indicating an enhanced synthesis of dopamine in these brain regions. Estradiol benzoate-treated rats had significantly lower anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation after intraperitoneal administration of 3,4-hydroxybenzyl-hydrazine dihydrochloride (NSD-1015), an irreversible inhibitor of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase whereas methylene blue did not affect anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation when compared to controls. The accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) following administration of the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, was used to estimate DA synthesis. Inhibition of PE synthesis by i.p. injection of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, produced a reversal of the effects of MDL 72,145 and Ro 19-6327. After 42 hr of abstinence, rats were challenged with either cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) or saline, followed by the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015; 100 mg/kg, ip). Following motor activity observations, the cerebral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 (100 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally) was administered and 30 min. later the animals were decapitated for subsequent analysis of the accumulated forebrain DOPA and 5-HTP levels, as an estimate of the rate of monoamine synthesis. The utility of this technique was demonstrated by comparing the effects on the scans of halothane and pentobarbital anesthesia and by the administration of NSD 1015, a peripheral and central inhibitor of L-aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase, between back-to-back scans. Addition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), prevented the formation of N-acetylcompounds from L-[3H]tyrosine, without resulting in an accumulation of label in L-DOPA. The effects of the peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors, carbidopa and benserazide, and the central AADC inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) on peripheral and brain monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B activity were investigated in the rat. Although the putative role of NSD-1015 is as an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, the present results demonstrate that, either as a result of this function and/or in addition to this role, NSD-1015 is a potent activator of the release of dopamine. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics. The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats. The L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine dihydrochloride) was then given ICV twice daily in a volume of 5.0 microliters in the following doses: 0.005, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 micrograms.

When pretreated with a central AADC inhibitor (NSD-1015) NSD 1015 (general AADC inhibitor) monoamine synthesis blockade induced by NSD-1015 (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase)  the aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) inhibitor NSD-1015 An accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence of female rats treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), and inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) activity, was associated with a decreased concentration of dopamine in the median eminence and pronounced reduction in the release of dopamine into hypophysial portal blood. 6S-BH4 increased extracellular DOPA levels in the presence of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (an index of in vivo tyrosine hydroxylase activity), to an extent similar to the increase induced by 6R-BH4. 5-HT synthesis was estimated by measuring the accumulation of the 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), in the neurointermediate lobe of male Long-Evans rats following the administration of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Monoamine synthesis was studied in different parts of the brain by measuring the accumulated dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 30 min after NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine HCl, 100 mg/kg) an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase, given i.p. HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection was used to make concurrent measurements of the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine in selected brain regions (striatum, nucleus accumbens, septum, medial periventricular hypothalamus) and thoracic spinal cords of rats treated with NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase. The activity of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurons has been estimated from measurements of: concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid; the ratio of the concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to 5-hydroxytryptamine; the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan following the administration of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., NSD 1015); the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine, and the rate of decline of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid following the administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e.g., pargyline). The accumulation of dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) after administration of NSD 1015 to inhibit aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase was determined as an index of NE synthesis. The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats. The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD 1015 markedly increased the dopa concentration. Using a microdialysis technique, the rat striatum was perfused with NSD-1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, and the amount of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulating in dialysate was measured as an index of in vivo activities of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase. Also, we studied the effect of MnCl2 on extracellular levels of l-Dopa in the presence of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor 3-hydroxybencilhydracine-HCl (NSD 1015). The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats. An accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence of female rats treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), and inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) activity, was associated with a decreased concentration of dopamine in the median eminence and pronounced reduction in the release of dopamine into hypophysial portal blood.  [Neurochemical study of effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazol and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites in the brain structures of Wistar rat on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015]. DOPA was measured in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamic-hypophysial portal blood after treatment with NSD-1015, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor.  Central action of an inhibitor of brain dopa-decarboxylase, NSD-1015, on cyanamide-induced alcohol drinking in rats. The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats.  The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA.  Furthermore, the ethanol-induced enhancement of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation in the mesolimbic dopamine terminal area after NSD 1015 (an inhibitor of l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase) was completely antagonized by mecamylamine in doses (3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg) that exerted no effects per se. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) enhanced L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in both the corpus striatum and limbic areas (nucleus accumbens) after inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase with NSD-1015, indicating an enhanced synthesis of dopamine in these brain regions. Estradiol benzoate-treated rats had significantly lower anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation after intraperitoneal administration of 3,4-hydroxybenzyl-hydrazine dihydrochloride (NSD-1015), an irreversible inhibitor of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase whereas methylene blue did not affect anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation when compared to controls. The accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) following administration of the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, was used to estimate DA synthesis. Inhibition of PE synthesis by i.p. injection of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, produced a reversal of the effects of MDL 72,145 and Ro 19-6327. After 42 hr of abstinence, rats were challenged with either cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) or saline, followed by the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015; 100 mg/kg, ip). Following motor activity observations, the cerebral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 (100 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally) was administered and 30 min. later the animals were decapitated for subsequent analysis of the accumulated forebrain DOPA and 5-HTP levels, as an estimate of the rate of monoamine synthesis. The utility of this technique was demonstrated by comparing the effects on the scans of halothane and pentobarbital anesthesia and by the administration of NSD 1015, a peripheral and central inhibitor of L-aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase, between back-to-back scans. Addition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), prevented the formation of N-acetylcompounds from L-[3H]tyrosine, without resulting in an accumulation of label in L-DOPA. The effects of the peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors, carbidopa and benserazide, and the central AADC inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) on peripheral and brain monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B activity were investigated in the rat. Although the putative role of NSD-1015 is as an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, the present results demonstrate that, either as a result of this function and/or in addition to this role, NSD-1015 is a potent activator of the release of dopamine. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics. The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats. The L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine dihydrochloride) was then given ICV twice daily in a volume of 5.0 microliters in the following doses: 0.005, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 micrograms. Although the putative role of NSD-1015 is as an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, the present results demonstrate that, either as a result of this function and/or in addition to this role, NSD-1015 is a potent activator of the release of dopamine.."
Is pseudouridine a RNA modification?,yes,Pseudouridine (Ψ) is the most abundant of>150 nucleoside modifications in RNA.  The number and position of the pseudouridines of Haloarcula marismortui and Deinococcus radiodurans large subunit RNA have been determined by a combination of total nucleoside analysis by HPLC-mass spectrometry and pseudouridine sequencing by the reverse transcriptase method and by LC/MS/MS.

Is there any involvement of the long non-coding RNA Gomafu in schizophrenia?,yes,"The long non-coding RNA Gomafu is acutely regulated in response to neuronal activation and involved in schizophrenia-associated alternative splicing. Here, we profile these transcriptomic responses and show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are dynamically regulated by neuronal activation, including acute downregulation of the lncRNA Gomafu, previously implicated in brain and retinal development. Moreover, we demonstrate that Gomafu binds directly to the splicing factors QKI and SRSF1 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1) and dysregulation of Gomafu leads to alternative splicing patterns that resemble those observed in SZ for the archetypal SZ-associated genes DISC1 and ERBB4. Finally, we show that Gomafu is downregulated in post-mortem cortical gray matter from the superior temporal gyrus in SZ. These results functionally link activity-regulated lncRNAs and alternative splicing in neuronal function and suggest that their dysregulation may contribute to neurological disorders. Gomafu/MIAT/Rncr2 is a long noncoding RNA that has been proposed to control retinal cell specification, stem cell differentiation and alternative splicing of schizophrenia-related genes.

Isn't infertility characteristic of individuals with Fanconi anemia?,no,"PALB2 links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in homologous recombinational repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Mono-allelic mutations in PALB2 increase the risk of breast, pancreatic, and other cancers, and biallelic mutations cause Fanconi anemia (FA).  Moreover, mutant males showed reduced fertility due to impaired meiosis and increased apoptosis in germ cells. Interestingly, mutant meiocytes showed a significant defect in sex chromosome synapsis, which likely contributed to the germ cell loss and fertility defect. In females with Fanconi anemia (FA), infertility is often accompanied by diminished ovarian reserve and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea before the age of 30 years, suggesting primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Substantially reduced AMH levels in females with FA suggest a primary ovarian defect associated with reduced fertility. Measurement of AMH at the time of FA diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of AMH levels at regular intervals may be useful for the timely management of complications related to POI such as subfertility/infertility, osteoporosis, and menopausal symptoms. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility.  Reduced fertility is one clinical manifestation among other well known Fanconi anemia features.  Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility Targeted disruption of exons 1 to 6 of the Fanconi Anemia group A gene leads to growth retardation, strain-specific microphthalmia, meiotic defects and primordial germ cell hypoplasia. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility. To potentially reduce late effects of malignancy, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), endocrinopathy, and infertility in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) undergoing HLA-matched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we developed a regimen using fludarabine (FLU), cyclophosphamide (CY), and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) followed by infusion of T-cell depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) or unmanipulated umbilical cord blood (UCB). Mutations in Fanca account for the majority of cases of Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessively inherited disease identified by congenital defects, bone marrow failure, infertility, and cancer susceptibility. FANCA is mutated in more than 60% of cases of Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, endocrine tissue cancer susceptibility, and infertility. In females with Fanconi anemia (FA), infertility is often accompanied by diminished ovarian reserve and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea before the age of 30 years, suggesting primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Fanconi anemia (FA) is a complex cancer susceptibility disorder associated with DNA repair defects and infertility, yet the precise function of the FA proteins in genome maintenance remains unclear. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease resulting in bone marrow failure, high cancer risks, and infertility, and developmental anomalies including microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypoplastic radius and thumb."
Is lenvatinib effective for renal cell carcinoma?,yes,"However, the combination of lenvatinib, a multitargeted agent that inhibits VEGF as well as FGF receptors, and everolimus demonstrated promising results in a randomized phase II trial.  The FDA has approved the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus to treat advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Moreover, a recent Phase II study demonstrated a significant benefit for the second-line combination treatment with everolimus plus lenvatinib (a novel TKI) in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival compared to the single-agent everolimus. We then discuss two recently approved growth factor receptor antagonists i.e. cabozantinib and lenvatinib, and a recently approved checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, and issues pertaining to drug development, and future directions in treatment of metastatic RCC.  INTERPRETATION: Lenvatinib plus everolimus and lenvatinib alone resulted in a progression-free survival benefit for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have progressed after one previous VEGF-targeted therapy.  Lenvatinib therapy for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Lenvatinib therapy for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma."
Does HuR bind to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs?,yes,"HuR is also overexpressed during tumourigenesis and is abnormally present within the cytoplasm, where it binds to AU-rich elements in the 3'UTRs of target mRNA and post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of its target genes. Human antigen R (HuR) is a ubiquitous 32 kDa protein comprising three RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs), whose main function is to bind Adenylate and uridylate Rich Elements (AREs) in 3' UnTranslated Regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. Human antigen R (HuR) is a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein that modulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The RNA-binding protein HuR binds at 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target transcripts, thereby protecting them against degradation.  ELAV/Hu proteins bind to AU-rich elements (ARE) in mRNAs and regulate their stability from splicing to translation, and the ubiquitous HuR protein has been implicated in cancerous cell growth.  This is achieved by altered expression of the proteins TTP and HuR, which bind 3' untranslated region (UTR) elements in cancer-related genes."
Doesn't CRISPR inversion of CTCF sites alter genome topology?,no,"CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function.

Can't Pentraxin 3 predict outcomes of sepsis?,no,"As compared with low serum PTX3and sTWEAK cases, cirrhotic patients with high serum PTX3/sTWEAK levels a have higher probability of new severe infections, severe sepsis, septic shock, type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, in-hospital, and 3-month follow-up mortalities.  Neonates with high nPTX3 concentrations also have lowered APGAR scores, increased rate of respiratory distress syndrome, clinical sepsis, IVH, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged NICU stay. In terms of predicting the prognosis of sepsis with heart failure complications, the PTX3 value's area under ROC curve was larger than that of BNP (respectively 0. 844, 0. 472).CONCLUSION: The PTX3 is an objective biochemical marker in diagnosis of sepsis; it is helpful in assessment of severity and prognosis of sepsis; it also has a certain clinical value in the assessment of sepsis cardiovascular function damage. Severe Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis is associated with elevation of pentraxin 3. Together, these results suggest that elevation of PTX3 is associated with fulminant disease during A. baumannii sepsis. Persisting high levels of plasma pentraxin 3 over the first days after severe sepsis and septic shock onset are associated with mortality. PTX3, as a mediator of inflammation, may represent an early marker of severity and outcome in sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Persisting high levels of circulating PTX3 over the first days from sepsis onset may be associated with mortality. PTX3 correlates with severity of sepsis and with sepsis-associated coagulation/fibrinolysis dysfunction. Pentraxin 3 in patients with severe sepsis or shock: the ALBIOS trial. Pentraxin 3: an immune modulator of infection and useful marker for disease severity assessment in sepsis. Redox state of pentraxin 3 as a novel biomarker for resolution of inflammation and survival in sepsis. The prototypic long pentraxin, pentraxin 3, is an acute phase protein that is structurally related but distinct from C-reactive protein which has proven to correlate with the severity of bacterial infection in critically ill patients. Circulating levels of the long pentraxin PTX3 correlate with severity of infection in critically ill patients. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is associated with severe sepsis and fatal disease in emergency room patients with suspected infection: a prospective cohort study. In addition, high levels of PTX3 were associated with unfavorable outcome.CONCLUSIONS: The long pentraxin PTX3 is elevated in critically ill patients and correlates with severity of disease and infection. PTX3, as a mediator of inflammation, may represent an early marker of severity and outcome in sepsis. Redox state of pentraxin 3 as a novel biomarker for resolution of inflammation and survival in sepsis. Persisting high levels of plasma pentraxin 3 over the first days after severe sepsis and septic shock onset are associated with mortality. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is associated with severe sepsis and fatal disease in emergency room patients with suspected infection: a prospective cohort study. The proteomic profile of circulating pentraxin 3 (PTX3) complex in sepsis demonstrates the interaction with azurocidin 1 and other components of neutrophil extracellular traps."
Isn't siltuximab effective for Castleman disease?,no,"Siltuximab: a targeted therapy for idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease. The recent approvals in North America, Europe and Brazil of siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, for iMCD now provide a safe and effective therapy that targets a key aspect of pathogenesis. In the first ever randomized, placebo-controlled trial in iMCD, siltuximab significantly reduced disease burden and symptoms in a large portion (34%) of patients. Despite recent significant advances in our understanding of this disease and the increasing therapeutic experience with rituximab, tocilizumab and siltuximab, there are still difficult questions concerning its aetiology, prognosis and optimal treatment. Emerging treatments in Castleman disease - a critical appraisal of siltuximab.  Siltuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to IL-6, has thus emerged as a promising treatment option in a disease lacking efficacious therapy. Here, we review the findings of recent studies evaluating single-agent siltuximab treatment in CD, including the first-ever randomized clinical trial in this disease. Although much more work is needed to establish a standardized treatment approach, siltuximab appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with newly diagnosed and previously treated CD. FDA approval: siltuximab for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease. On April 22, 2014, the FDA granted full approval to siltuximab (SYLVANT for injection; Janssen Biotech, Inc.), a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody to IL6, for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative.  Currently, there are more effective therapeutic alternatives in multicentric Castleman disease: treatment with monotherapy of rituximab or in combination therapy with immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide or lenalidomide, treatment with anti-IL-6 (siltuximab) or against its receptor (tocilizumab).  Currently, there are more effective therapeutic alternatives in multicentric Castleman disease: treatment with monotherapy of rituximab or in combination therapy with immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide or lenalidomide, treatment with anti-IL-6 (siltuximab) or against its receptor (tocilizumab).

Siltuximab, a novel anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody, for Castleman's disease. PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of siltuximab, an anti-interleukin-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma, or Castleman disease.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In an open-label, dose-finding, 7 cohort, phase I study, patients with NHL, multiple myeloma, or symptomatic Castleman disease received siltuximab 3, 6, 9, or 12 mg/kg weekly, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks. Dose selection of siltuximab for multicentric Castleman's disease. Here, modeling and simulation of the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship between siltuximab and CRP were used to support dose selection for multicentric Castleman's disease (CD).METHODS: PK/PD modeling was applied to explore the relationship between siltuximab PK and CRP suppression following intravenous siltuximab infusion in 47 patients with B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 17), multiple myeloma (n = 13), or CD (n = 17). Currently, there are more effective therapeutic alternatives in multicentric Castleman disease: treatment with monotherapy of rituximab or in combination therapy with immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide or lenalidomide, treatment with anti-IL-6 (siltuximab) or against its receptor (tocilizumab) Three (6%) of 53 patients had serious adverse events judged reasonably related to siltuximab (lower respiratory tract infection, anaphylactic reaction, sepsis).Siltuximab plus best supportive care was superior to best supportive care alone for patients with symptomatic multicentric Castlemans disease and well tolerated with prolonged exposure Siltuximab, an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated durable tumor and symptomatic responses in a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled study of MCD.This preplanned safety analysis was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of siltuximab treatment among 19 patients with MCD who had stable disease or better and were enrolled in a phase-1 study and subsequent ongoing, open-label, phase-2 extension study Analysis of Inflammatory and Anemia-Related Biomarkers in a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Siltuximab (Anti-IL6 Monoclonal Antibody) in Patients With Multicentric Castleman Disease Siltuximab (IL6 antibody) is approved for the treatment of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) Siltuximab for multicentric Castleman disease FDA approval: siltuximab for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease On April 22, 2014, the FDA granted full approval to siltuximab (SYLVANT for injection; Janssen Biotech, Inc.), a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody to IL6, for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative Siltuximab for multicentric Castleman's disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Clinical benefit response (CBR; composite of hemoglobin, fatigue, anorexia, fever/night sweats, weight, largest lymph node size) was also evaluated in Castleman disease.Sixty-seven patients received a median of 16 siltuximab doses for a median of 8.5 (maximum 60.5) months; 29 were treated 1 year or longer. The recent approvals in North America, Europe and Brazil of siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, for iMCD now provide a safe and effective therapy that targets a key aspect of pathogenesis. Although much more work is needed to establish a standardized treatment approach, siltuximab appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with newly diagnosed and previously treated CD. No dose-limiting toxicity was reported, and only three patients had grade 3 or higher adverse events after a median exposure of 331 days (range, 1 to 1,148 days).These interim results strongly suggest that siltuximab is an effective treatment with favorable safety for the management of CD. Siltuximab is a new anti-IL-6, chimeric monoclonal antibody with potential therapeutic benefit in patients with CD.METHODS: We report interim results from an open-label, dose-finding, seven-cohort, phase I study in which patients with symptomatic, multicentric or unresectable, unicentric CD received siltuximab at 1-, 2-, or 3-week intervals.

Is the enzyme EPRS phosphorylated?,yes,"Phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) has been investigated extensively in our laboratory for more than a decade, and has served as an archetype for studies of other AARSs. EPRS is dually phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Ser(886) and then by a Cdk5-dependent-AGC kinase at Ser(999);  Diphosphorylated EPRS is released from its residence in the tRNA multisynthetase complex for immediate binding to NS1-associated protein and subsequent binding to ribosomal protein L13a and GAPDH.  Two-site phosphorylation of EPRS coordinates multimodal regulation of noncanonical translational control activity."
Isn't there a relationship between B cells and Multiple Sclerosis?,no,"These results suggest that RRMS patients with radiological phenotypes showing high neurodegeneration have changes in B cells characterized by down-regulation of B-cell-specific genes and increased activation status Although the exact etiology is still obscure, the leading hypothesis behind MS relapses is acute inflammatory attacks on CNS myelin and axons. This complex process involves B and T cells together with macrophages and microglia. It is currently known that CD24 serves as a costimulatory factor of T cells that regulate their homeostasis and proliferation, while in B cells, CD24 is functionally involved in cell activation and differentiation. CD24 can enhance autoimmune diseases in terms of its protective role in the clonal deletion of autoreactive thymocytes Multiple B cell-dependent mechanisms contributing to inflammatory demyelination of the CNS have been explored using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4 T cell-dependent animal model for multiple sclerosis.  The role of B cells in multiple sclerosis: rationale for B-cell-targeted therapies. Interest in CD8+ T cells and B cells was initially inspired by observations in multiple sclerosis rather than in animal models: CD8+ T cells predominate in multiple sclerosis lesions, oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands in CSF have long been recognised as diagnostic and prognostic markers, and anti-B-cell therapies showed considerable efficacy in multiple sclerosis. Differential effects of fingolimod on B-cell populations in multiple sclerosis. Unaltered regulatory B-cell frequency and function in patients with multiple sclerosis. B cells are increasingly recognized as major players in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. These observations underscore the B cell's contribution to the putative underpinnings of multiple sclerosis. Data suggesting that B cells play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis have been accumulating for the past five decades, demonstrating that the cerebrospinal fluid and central nervous system tissues of multiple sclerosis patients contain B cells, plasma cells, antibodies, and immunoglobulins. B-cell-targeted treatment for multiple sclerosis: mechanism of action and clinical data. Subset composition and cytokine production of B cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multiple sclerosis patients under Fingolimod treatment, untreated multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls were analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA. In particular, antigen presentation between B cells and T cells, increased trafficking of B cells across the blood-brain barrier, and autoantibodies produced by plasma cells may contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Accumulating evidence supports a major role of B cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathology of B cells and their role in central nervous system autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Targeting B cells in the treatment of multiple sclerosis: recent advances and remaining challenges phingosine-1-phosphate receptors control B-cell migration through signaling components associated with primary immunodeficiencies, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple sclerosis"

Does Jarid2 play a role in early embryo development?,yes,"Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development Unlike other PRC2-deficient embryonic stem cells (ESCs), however, Jarid2-deficient ESCs show a severe differentiation block, altered colony morphology, and distinctive patterns of deregulated gene expression. Here, we show that Jarid2(-/-) ESCs express constitutively high levels of Nanog but reduced PCP signaling components Wnt9a, Prickle1, and Fzd2 and lowered β-catenin activity. Depletion of Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 from wild-type ESCs or overexpression of Nanog largely phenocopies these cellular defects. Co-culture of Jarid2(-/-) with wild-type ESCs restores variable Nanog expression and β-catenin activity and can partially rescue the differentiation block of mutant cells. In addition, we show that ESCs lacking Jarid2 or Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 or overexpressing Nanog induce multiple ICM formation when injected into normal E3.5 blastocysts. These data describe a previously unrecognized role for Jarid2 in regulating a core pluripotency and Wnt/PCP signaling circuit that is important for ESC differentiation and for pre-implantation development. Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development. Consistent with an essential role for PcG proteins in early development, we demonstrate that JARID2 is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Jumonij (JMJ)/Jarid2 plays important roles in embryonic development and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Thus, these results demonstrate that JARID2 is essential for the binding of PcG proteins to target genes and, consistent with this, for the proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells and normal development. JARID2 is an accessory component of Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) required for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development.

Can't glyburide reduce cerebral edema?,no,"Preclinical studies have shown that a continuous infusion of glyburide blocks edema formation and improves outcome. We hypothesize that treatment with RP-1127 (Glyburide for Injection) reduces formation of brain edema in patients after large anterior circulation infarction. CONCLUSIONS: GAMES-RP was designed to provide critical information regarding glyburide for injection in patients with large hemispheric stroke and will inform the design of future studies. Glyburide is associated with attenuated vasogenic edema in stroke patients. Glyburide is reported to prevent brain swelling in preclinical rodent models of ischemic stroke through inhibition of a non-selective channel composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4.  RESULTS: We report that IV glyburide was associated with T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity ratio on brain MRI, diminished the lesional water diffusivity between days 1 and 2 (pseudo-normalization), and reduced blood MMP-9 level.CONCLUSIONS: Several surrogate markers of vasogenic edema appear to be reduced in the setting of IV glyburide treatment in human stroke.  Pilot study of intravenous glyburide in patients with a large ischemic stroke. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preclinical and retrospective clinical data indicate that glyburide, a selective inhibitor of sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential melastatin 4, is effective in preventing edema and improving outcome after focal ischemia.

Glyburide is a safe, inexpensive, and efficacious alternative to dexamethasone for the treatment of cerebral metastasis-related vasogenic edema. In this focused review, we explore preclinical data linking Sur1 channel formation to development of edema and reference evidence suggesting that the antidiabetic sulfonylurea drug glyburide (a Sur1 inhibitor) is an inexpensive and well-tolerated agent that can be clinically tested to reduce or prevent malignancy and/or treatment-associated edema.

Are mutations in the C9orf72  gene associated with macular degeneration?,no,"Over the years, however, growing evidence from clinical, pathological and genetic findings has suggested that ALS and FTD belong to the same clinic-pathological spectrum disorder. This concept has been further supported by the identification of the most common genetic cause for both diseases, an aberrantly expanded hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC/ CCCCGG sequence located in a non-coding region of the gene C9orf72. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by motor neurone loss resulting in muscle weakness, spasticity and ultimately death. 5-10% are caused by inherited mutations, most commonly C9ORF72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. In this article, we will review the brief characterizations of the C9ORF72 gene, the expansion mutations, the related disorders, and their features, followed by a discussion of the deficiency knowledge of C9ORF72 mutations. Mutations in the C9ORF72 gene may be a major cause not only of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease but also of late onset psychosis.

Are cutaneous porphyrias inherited with a recessive pattern?,no,Five of the porphyrias are low-penetrance autosomal dominant conditions in which clinical expression results from additional factors that act by increasing demand for haem or by causing an additional decrease in enzyme activity or by a combination of these effects Molecular mechanisms of dominant expression in porphyria. Variegate porphyria (VP) is an autosomal-dominant disorder that is caused by inheritance of a partial deficiency of the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4). It is characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity and/or various neurological manifestations.  The acute porphyrias constitute a group of metabolic disorders engaging enzymes in the haem synthetic chain and generally following dominant inheritance patterns.
Is Cryptococcus neoformans a frequent cause of isolated skin infections in immunocompromised individuals,no,"Cryptococcus is an opportunistic yeast with a worldwide distribution that primarily causes significant infections in immunocompromised individuals, generally by affecting the respiratory tract. But primary cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC) without systemic infection is rare.  Cryptococcus is a ubiquitous fungus and is known for causing meningitis and cutaneous infections in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can cause primary pulmonary infections or disseminate and cause infections of the central nervous system, meninges, skin, and bone in the immunocompromised host. The authors report a male patient, a seller with no detected immunosuppression, with an extensive ulcerated skin lesion localized on the left forearm, caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var."
Isn't Obeticholic Acid used for treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis?,no,"Obeticholic acid in primary biliary cholangitis. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study including 217 patients with primary biliary cholangitis, the authors show that obeticholic acid (a potent farnesoid X agonist) administered with ursodeoxycholic acid or as monotherapy significantly decreases serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin when compared to placebo. Obeticholic acid (Ocaliva(TM)) is a farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonist that is being developed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various liver diseases, and has recently been granted accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate ursodeoxycholic acid.  Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist which has been evaluated as a second line therapy in PBC and has recently been licenced by the FDA. OCA will be the first stratified therapy introduced in PBC, however confirmatory trial and real life data are needed to confirm that suggestive biochemical improvements are matched by improvement in key clinical outcomes. Obeticholic acid for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in adult patients: clinical utility and patient selection. A series of clinical trials of OCA in PBC, primarily in combination with UDCA, have established that OCA leads to significant reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase that are predicted to lead to improved clinical outcomes, while dose-dependent pruritus has been the most common adverse effect. On the basis of these studies, OCA was given conditional approval by the US Food and Drug Administration with plans to establish the long-term clinical efficacy of OCA in patients with advanced PBC. Although obeticholic acid was approved by the FDA for the treatment of PBC in May 2016, this development occurred after the symposium presentation.  While several agents are being studied in combination with UDCA, monotherapy with the novel agent obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, has also shown promising results.

Doesn't GATA-1 regulate ribosomal protein genes?,no,"Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of GATA-1 and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, GATA-1s. These mutations have been found in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital erythroid aplasia typically caused by mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Sixteen of the corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1). Deletion of PKC1 relieves the repression of both ribosomal protein and rRNA genes that occurs in response to a defect in the secretory pathway. This stress is monitored by Pkc1p, which initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to repression of transcription of the rRNA and ribosomal protein genes. The importance of the transcription of the 137 ribosomal protein genes to the economy of the cell is apparent from the existence of at least three distinct pathways that can effect the repression of this set of genes."

Is POLD3 essential for mouse development?,yes,"The Pold3 gene encodes a subunit of the Polδ DNA polymerase complex. Pold3 orthologs are not essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or chicken DT40 cells, but the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ortholog is essential. POLD3 also has a specialized role in the repair of broken replication forks, suggesting that POLD3 activity could be particularly relevant for cancer cells enduring high levels of DNA replication stress. We report here that POLD3 is essential for mouse development and is also required for viability in adult animals.

Is it feasible to obtain DNA read lengths that exceed 30 Kb?,no,"Single-molecule, real-time sequencing (SMRT) developed by Pacific BioSciences produces longer reads than secondary generation sequencing technologies such as Illumina. The long read length enables PacBio sequencing to close gaps in genome assembly, reveal structural variations, and identify gene isoforms with higher accuracy in transcriptomic sequencing.  Third-generation sequencing, with read lengths>10 kb, will improve the assembly of complex genomes, but these techniques require high-molecular-weight genomic DNA (gDNA), and gDNA extraction protocols used for obtaining smaller fragments for short-read sequencing are not suitable for this purpose. The emergence and development of so called third generation sequencing platforms such as PacBio has permitted exceptionally long reads (over 20 kb) to be generated."

Isn't autophagy the process where bacteria ingest viral particles?,no,"Autophagy, a cellular degradation process Autophagy, a form of lysosomal degradation capable of eliminating dysfunctional proteins and organelles, is a cellular process associated with homeostasis. Autophagy, a programmed process in which cell contents are delivered to lysosomes for degradation, appears to have both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting functions; both stimulation and inhibition of autophagy have been reported to induce cancer cell death, and particular genes and proteins have been associated both positively and negatively with autophagy Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated catabolic process involving the degradation of intracellular contents (e.g., proteins and organelles) as well as invading microbes (e.g., parasites, bacteria and viruses). Autophagy is a cellular process that targets proteins, lipids and organelles to lysosomes for degradation, but it has also been shown to combat infection with various pathogenic bacteria. Autophagy, an intracellular degradation process highly conserved from yeast to humans, is viewed as an important defence mechanism to clear intracellular bacteria. Autophagy has intracellular anti-viral and anti-bacterial functions, and plays a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system responses to viral and bacterial infections. documented abundant autophagy within VZV-infected cells throughout the infectious cycle but also demonstrated that VZV-induced autophagy facilitated VZV glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing.

Is tirilazad effective for treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage?,no,"There was no significant difference between the two groups at the end of follow up for the primary outcome, death (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06), or in poor outcome (death, vegetative state or severe disability) (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21). During the treatment period, fewer patients developed delayed cerebral ischaemia in the tirilazad group than in the control group (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.93). Subgroup analyses did not demonstrate any significant difference in effects of tirilazad on clinical outcomes.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that tirilazad, in addition to nimodipine, reduces mortality or improves poor outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH. This clinical trial suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day, improves overall outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. Tirilazad is ineffective.There are many possible successful treatment options for preventing vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, and poor neurologic outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, further multicenter RCTs need to be performed to determine if there is a significant benefit from their use Findings from previous multicenter clinical trials have suggested that tirilazad mesylate, a synthetic nonhormonal 21-aminosteroid, might be effective in preventing delayed cerebral ischemia following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

Isn't dexamethasone recommended for treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage?,yes,"Dexamethasone and other glucocorticoids should be avoided.  During the third interim analysis, the death rate at the 21st day was identical in the two groups (dexamethasone vs. placebo, 21 of 46 vs. 21 of 47; chi-square = 0.01, P = 0.93). In contrast, the rate of complications (mostly infections and complications of diabetes) was much higher in the dexamethasone group (chi-square = 10.89, P less than 0.001), leading to early termination of the study. In the light of the absence of a demonstrable beneficial effect and the presence of a significant harmful effect, current practices of using dexamethasone for treatment of primary supratentorial hemorrhage should be reconsidered.

Is edema a symptom of nephrotic syndrome?,yes,"Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a common clinical disease with four main clinical manifestations: hypoalbuminemia (<30 g/L), macro-proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 h), edema, and hyperlipidemia.  Nephrotic syndrome is an unusual manifestation of IgA Nephropathy (IgAN). Twelve patients with IgAN with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome were evaluated and followed up. All patients presented with generalized edema.  The clinical features of sudden onset of generalized edema, initial heavy proteinuria and initial severe hypoalbuminemia might help identify the subset of patients, especially in low grade IgAN. Most patients presented within 3 months duration (61.4%) and the most common symptom was puffiness of face (98.45%) followed by pedal edema (91%).  We analyzed medical records of 290 patients with diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome as defined by International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC), between January 1987 and December 2000, at the Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar.  He was admitted because of systemic edema and dyspnea on effort Laboratory data revealed renal failure and nephrotic syndrome, whereas there was no symptom of diabetic retinopathy. Nephrotic syndrome: more than just oedema. Oedema is the commonest presenting symptom and sign in nephrotic syndrome.  One of these five clinical syndromes is the nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria > 3.5 g/day accompanied by hypalbuminemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and pronounced edema Tolvaptan therapy for massive edema in a patient with nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by water and sodium retention, which leads to edema The non-osmotic stimulation of arginine vasopressin release from the pituitary gland has been implicated as one of the important factors in abnormal water retention in patients with NS.We present the initial description of a patient with massive edema caused by refractory nephrotic syndrome, which was effectively treated with tolvaptan, a selective oral vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist.Tolvaptan is effective for the treatment of massive edema caused by NS We report a child with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with diuretic-resistant nephrotic edema treated successfully using acute peritoneal dialysis as a means of UF Albumin and Furosemide Combination for Management of Edema in Nephrotic Syndrome: A Review of Clinical Studies The treatment of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome is generally managed by dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics Nine months after introduction of tiopronin, the boy manifested generalized edema, oliguria, and biochemical indices of nephrotic syndrome Blessed were the days when it all made sense and the apparent mechanism for edema formation in nephrotic syndrome was straightforward: the kidneys lost protein in the urine, which lowered the plasma oncotic pressure The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by a combination of pathological lab values and clinical symptoms, i. e. pronounced proteinuria (usually more than 3 - 3,5 g protein/24 h), hypoalbuminemia, edema and hyperlipidemia. The patient was admitted with edema of both legs, and the nephrotic syndrome was discovered, leading to the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis on kidney biopsy.

Is there an association between Histone H3.3 mutations and glioma?,yes,"PURPOSE: Histone H3.3 (H3F3A) mutation in the codon for lysine 27 (K27M) has been found as driver mutations in pediatric glioblastoma and has been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of thalamic gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. We report a case of thalamic glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation, which was detected in both the primary tumor diagnosed as diffuse astrocytoma obtained during the first surgery and also in the tumor diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytoma obtained at the second surgery. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates minute neuroradiological and pathological features of malignant transformation from thalamic low grade glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. The pathological diagnosis was anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and we identified a mutation in histone H3.3 in the tumor specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse. We highlight the genetic aberrations recently discovered in isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked, death-domain-associated protein, histone H3.3, and telomerase reverse transcriptase and discuss how these mutations lead to unexpected changes in the epigenetic landscape in gliomas. Particularly striking is the discovery of frequent histone H3.3 mutations in pediatric glioma, a particularly aggressive neoplasm that has long remained poorly understood Exon sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression A lesson learned from the H3.3K27M mutation found in pediatric glioma: a new approach to the study of the function of histone modifications in vivo Pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is rare, and there is a single study, a seminal discovery showing association of histone H3.3 and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 mutation with a DNA methylation signature. Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3. Mutations in H3F3A, which encodes histone H3.3, commonly occur in pediatric glioblastoma. Somatic mutations of the H3F3A and HIST1H3B genes encoding the histone H3 variants, H3.3 and H3.1, were recently identified in high-grade gliomas arising in the thalamus, pons and spinal cord of children and young adults. K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Recurrent mutations affecting the histone H3.3 residues Lys27 or indirectly Lys36 are frequent drivers of pediatric high-grade gliomas (over 30% of HGGs). Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation. Recent studies on high-grade pediatric GBM have identified two recurrent mutations (K27M and G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3 (H3F3A for H3.3 and HIST1H3B for H3.1).

Is Pfh1 a component of the replisome?,no,"Pfh1 Is an Accessory Replicative Helicase that Interacts with the Replisome to Facilitate Fork Progression and Preserve Genome Integrity Although the Schizosaccharomyces pombe 5'-to-3' DNA helicase Pfh1 is known to promote fork progression, its genomic targets, dynamics, and mechanisms of action are largely unknown. Here we address these questions by integrating genome-wide identification of Pfh1 binding sites, comprehensive analysis of the effects of Pfh1 depletion on replication and DNA damage, and proteomic analysis of Pfh1 interaction partners by immunoaffinity purification mass spectrometry. DNA replication through hard-to-replicate sites, including both highly transcribed RNA Pol II and Pol III genes, requires the S. pombe Pfh1 helicase. Here, we show that Pfh1 is required for efficient fork movement in the ribosomal DNA, the mating type locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by RNA polymerase II.   Thus, Pfh1 promotes DNA replication and separation of converged replication forks and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites. Cells depleted of Pfh1 were inviable if they also lacked the human TIMELESS homolog Swi1, a replisome component that stabilizes stalled forks. Pfh1 Is an Accessory Replicative Helicase that Interacts with the Replisome to Facilitate Fork Progression and Preserve Genome Integrity. Thus, we conclude that Pfh1 is an accessory DNA helicase that interacts with the replisome and promotes replication and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites. Consistent with this interpretation, Pfh1 co-purified with many key replisome components, including the hexameric MCM helicase, replicative DNA polymerases, RPA, and the processivity clamp PCNA in an S phase dependent manner. Although Pfh1 affected replication and suppressed DNA damage at discrete sites throughout the genome, Pfh1 and the replicative DNA polymerase bound to similar extents to both Pfh1-dependent and independent sites, suggesting that Pfh1 is proximal to the replication machinery during S phase.

Isn't there any involvement of L1 retrotransposition in the Rett syndrome?,no,"Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. Our data demonstrate that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of neuronal L1 retrotransposition. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the molecular events that can lead to neurological disorders. Furthermore, some neurological diseases, such as Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia, misregulate L1 retrotransposition, which could contribute to some pathological aspects.  Recent studies indicate that long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) are mobilized in the genome of human neural progenitor cells and enhanced in Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia.  In addition, recent data indicate that engineered human L1s can undergo somatic retrotransposition in human neural progenitor cells and that an increase in human-specific L1 DNA content can be detected in the brains of normal controls, as well as in Rett syndrome patients.

Doesn't TFIIS affect nucleosome positioning?,no,"Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome.  The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT The system contains natural or recombinant histones, chromatin assembly factors, the histone-acetyltransferase p300, all components of the general transcription machinery, general coactivators and the elongation factor SII (TFIIS). Efficient and rapid nucleosome traversal by RNA polymerase II depends on a combination of transcript elongation factors. We now show that although TFIIF or TFIIS alone is modestly stimulatory for nucleosome traversal, both factors together increase transcription through nucleosomes in a synergistic manner. Significantly, we found that nucleosomes with a Sin mutant histone are traversed to the same extent and at nearly the same rate as equivalent pure DNA templates if both TFIIS and TFIIF are present. After partial uncoiling of nucleosomal DNA from histone octamer by Pol II and backtracking of the enzyme, nucleosomal DNA recoils on the octamer, locking Pol II in the arrested state. Histone chaperones and transcription factors TFIIS, TFIIF and FACT facilitate transcription through chromatin using different molecular mechanisms. Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome. The highly conserved eukaryotic transcriptional elongation factor TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to read though pause or termination sites, nucleosomes and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. We also studied the effect of TFIIF and TFIIS on transcription of nucleosomes containing a Sin mutant histone. The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT."
Doesn't TUC.338 inhibit colorectal cancer?,yes,"TUC.338 promotes invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer. Until now, the role of TUC.338 in colorectal cancers remains undefined. This study revealed that TUC.338 is significantly up-regulated in colorectal cancers (CRC) tissue and CRC cell lines, and the up-regulated TUC.338 is associated with lymph node metastasis.  Thus, these findings suggested that TUC.338 acts as a novel oncogene by targeting the TIMP-1 gene thus promoting colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion.

We present evidence that Drk, the Drosophila ortholog of the adaptor protein Grb2, is essential for ARM within adult mushroom body neurons."
Is there increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains?,no,"Evidence of reduced recombination rate in human regulatory domains. We study the relationship between recombination rate and gene regulatory domains, defined by a gene and its linked control elements. We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets (Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types. Each link type shows a ""recombination rate valley"" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions. This recombination rate valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species. Recombination rate valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line. Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of a recombination rate valley at regulatory domains and provide a potential molecular mechanism to interpret the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variations."

Has IVIG been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease?,yes,"Clinical trials of intravenous immunoglobulin for Alzheimer's disease. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that IVIG has anti-amyloid and immune modulatory properties relevant to treating neurodegenerative disorders. In early stage AD clinical trials, IVIG was found to reduce cognitive decline and increase brain glucose metabolism. Unfortunately, IVIG failed to meet primary outcome objectives in the North American Phase 3 clinical trial in mild to moderate AD. While the results of clinical trials to date do not provide support for the use of IVIG to treat AD at the doses tested, additional studies of IVIG's mechanisms are warranted and may guide the development of more effective therapies for AD in the future."
Does a tonsillectomy affect the patient's voice?,yes,"Group B had a better awareness of tooth damage (78% vs 30% of patients, P ≤ .001), voice change (61 vs 19%, P = .005), and burns to lips and mouth (44% vs 8%, P = .005). Finally, 35% more patients from group B rated their understanding of tonsillectomy as good or very good (P = .017).  Some patients complaint for dry throat, foreign body sensation or voice change after tonsillectomy. The percentage of patients who had temporary voice change was 62.7%, and 15.4% had a follow-up clinic visit. There is no dose-escalation response to dexamethasone (0.0625-1.0 mg/kg) in pediatric tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy patients for preventing vomiting, reducing pain, shortening time to first liquid intake, or the incidence of voice change. There were no differences in secondary outcomes (analgesic requirements, time to first liquid, and change in voice) across treatment groups. Voice change, reported by approximately 70% of all patients, was the most common complaint, but it resolved in all instances. The incidence rates of voice change, velopharyngeal insufficiency, bleeding, constipation, dehydration, and pain were measured.  Tonsillectomy affects voice performance negatively in adults in short term; however, it does not affect voice performance in long term after surgery. The surgical technique, whether it is cold knife or thermal welding system, does not appear to affect voice and speech in tonsillectomy patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in acoustic features of voice after tonsillectomy. Surgical indications for tonsillectomy in the young voice patient are discussed.

Isn't ACI-35 a passive vaccine?,yes,Two active vaccines targeting either nonphosphorylated (AAD-vac1) and phosphorylated tau (ACI-35) have entered Phase I testing.
Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?,yes,"Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters. Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes. I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively. Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. DNA methylation directly silences genes with non-CpG island promoters and establishes a nucleosome occupied promoter. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters.  Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture. The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar.  DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning.  DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the 5'-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. he induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other. Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this ""ground state"" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy.  In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. Throughout the genome, nucleosome occupancy was correlated with certain histone methylation or acetylation modifications. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted."
Do chromatin features predict genes associated with eQTLs?,yes,"Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict>90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Cell type-specific gene expression in humans involves complex interactions between regulatory factors and DNA at enhancers and promoters. Mapping studies for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin markers have become widely used tools for identifying gene regulatory elements, but prediction of target genes remains a major challenge. Here, we integrate genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes, proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes 150 kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators. Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at most 0.75 for using any single feature. We hope this study will not only provide validation of eQTL-mapping studies, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanisms explaining how genetic variation can influence gene expression."
Is Kummell’s disease an avascular necrosis of the vertebral body?,yes,"Kummell's disease is an avascular necrosis of the vertebral body, secondary to a vertebral compression fracture. This entity is characterised by the gradual development in time of a vertebral body collapse following a trivial spinal trauma, involving a worsening back pain associated with a progressive kyphosis.

Is a CpG island methylator phenotype involved in ependymomas?,yes,"Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype Although no recurrently mutated genes were found throughout these groups of ependymomas, PFA exhibited a CpG island methylator phenotype, PFB was associated with extensive chromosomal aberrations, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion gene was frequently observed in supratentorial ependymomas.  Supratentorial and spinal pediatric ependymomas display a hypermethylated phenotype which includes the loss of tumor suppressor genes involved in the control of cell growth and death. Supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the 'CpG island methylator phenotype' (CIMP) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma. The data suggests epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of supratentorial and spinal, but not posterior fossa ependymomas. Hypermethylation correlated with a decrease in expression of a number of tumor suppressor genes and pathways that could be playing an important role in tumor pathogenesis. Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype. CpG island methylator phenotype-positive hindbrain ependymomas are responsive to clinical drugs that target either DNA or H3K27 methylation both in vitro and in vivo.

The human genome folds to create thousands of intervals, called ""contact domains,"" that exhibit enhanced contact frequency within themselves. ""Loop domains"" form because of tethering between two loci-almost always bound by CTCF and cohesin-lying on the same chromosome. ""Compartment domains"" form when genomic intervals with similar histone marks co-segregate. Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. cohesin loss eliminates all loop domains"
Are mouse chromosomes acrocentric?,yes,"Based on combined fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage mapping, the gene order on CFA9 is similar to that of the homologous genes on HSA17q and mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), but in the dog the gene order is inverted with respect to the centromere.  In murine models of human carcinogenesis, however, karyotype analysis is technically demanding because mouse chromosomes are acrocentric and of similar size. The minor satellite is closer to the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes than the major satellite  These cells contain Robertsonian translocated chromosomes 1 and 7 as the only submetacentric chromosome in an otherwise acrocentric genome.  The resulting metacentric chromosomes are very different in size and in morphology from normal mouse acrocentric chromosomes.  Because of 35 independent primary hybrids used in this study were derived from two types of feral mice, each with a different combination of Robertsonian translocation chromosomes, as well as from mice with a normal complement of acrocentric chromosomes, analysis of 16 selected mouse enzyme markers provided data on the segregation of all 20 mouse chromosomes in these hybrids The two mouse stocks exhibit karyotypes consisting of nine pairs of metacentric chromosomes as a result of centric fusions of acrocentric chromosomes in different combinations. Physical gene mapping by in situ hybridization is a difficult task in an all-acrocentric mouse karyotype, because all of the chromosomes are morphologically very similar. The resulting metacentric chromosomes are very different in size and in morphology from normal mouse acrocentric chromosomes. murine models of human carcinogenesis are exceedingly valuable tools to understand genetic mechanisms of neoplastic growth the identification of recurrent chromosomal rearrangements by cytogenetic techniques serves as an initial screening test for tumour specific aberrations in murine models of human carcinogenesis however karyotype analysis is technically demanding because mouse chromosomes are acrocentric and of similar size fluorescence in situ hybridization fish with mouse chromosome specific painting probes can complement conventional banding analysis although sensitive and specific fish analyses are restricted to the visualization of only a few mouse chromosomes at a time here we apply a novel imaging technique that we developed recently for the visualization of human chromosomes to the simultaneous discernment of all mouse chromosomes the approach is based on spectral imaging to measure chromosome specific spectra after fish with differentially labelled mouse chromosome painting probes utilizing a combination of fourier spectroscopy ccd imaging and conventional optical microscopy spectral imaging allows simultaneous measurement of the fluorescence emission spectrum at all sample points a spectrum based classification algorithm has been adapted to karyotype mouse chromosomes we have applied spectral karyotyping sky to chemically induced plasmocytomas mammary gland tumours from transgenic mice overexpressing the c myc oncogene and thymomas from mice deficient for the ataxia telangiectasia atm gene results from these analyses demonstrate the potential of sky to identify complex chromosomal aberrations in mouse models of human carcinogenesis."
Is overproduction of transthyretin is associated with amyloidosis associated neuropathy?,yes,"Transthyretin-associated familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is a disease caused by the deposit of abnormal transthyretin on tissues, mainly nerves transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy We report a new transthyretin (ATTR) gene c.272C>G mutation and variant protein, p.Leu32Val, in a kindred of Bolivian origin with a rapid progressive peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopat Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, first described in families with sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. Abnormal deposition of aggregated wild-type (WT) human transthyretin (TTR) and its pathogenic variants is responsible for cardiomyopathy and neuropathy related to TTR amyloidosis.  Transthyretin (TTR), normally a plasma circulating protein, can become misfolded and aggregated, ultimately leading to extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils usually targeted to heart or nerve tissues. Referred to as TTR-associated amyloidoses (ATTR), this group of diseases is frequently life threatening and fatal if untreated Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, first described in families with sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is usually characterised by a progressive peripheral and autonomic neuropathy often with associated cardiac failure and is due to dominantly inherited transthyretin mutations causing accelerated amyloid deposition."

Are there mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions?,yes,"Genome-wide characterization of mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions. Gene expression in mammals is precisely regulated by the combination of promoters and gene-distal regulatory regions, known as enhancers. Several studies have suggested that some promoters might have enhancer functions. However, the extent of this type of promoters and whether they actually function to regulate the expression of distal genes have remained elusive. Here, by exploiting a high-throughput enhancer reporter assay, we unravel a set of mammalian promoters displaying enhancer activity. These promoters have distinct genomic and epigenomic features and frequently interact with other gene promoters. Extensive CRISPR-Cas9 genomic manipulation demonstrated the involvement of these promoters in the cis regulation of expression of distal genes in their natural loci. Our results have important implications for the understanding of complex gene regulation in normal development and disease.

Are splicing speckles associated with transcription?,no,"We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes. We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces. Analysis of a HeLa cell line stably expressing EYFP-NHPX showed that the nucleolar accumulation of NHPX was preceded by its transient accumulation in splicing speckles. In vivo analysis of NHPX reveals a novel nucleolar localization pathway involving a transient accumulation in splicing speckles. ""Splicing speckles"" are major nuclear domains rich in components of the splicing machinery and polyA(+) RNA. Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckle In normal cell growth conditions GFPeIF4A-III was mainly nucleoplasmic, but in hypoxia stress conditions it moved to the nucleolus and splicing speckles. Localization of eIF4A-III in the nucleolus and splicing speckles is an indicator of plant stress.  Using antibodies raised against mouse RBM6 to immunostain mammalian cell lines we found that the endogenous protein was both distributed diffusely in the nucleus and concentrated in a small number of nuclear foci that corresponded to splicing speckles/interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs Subnuclear targeting of the RNA-binding motif protein RBM6 to splicing speckles and nascent transcripts."
Can multiple myeloma patients develop hyperviscosity syndrome?,yes,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an immedicable malignancy of the human plasma cells producing abnormal antibodies (also referred to as paraproteins) leading to kidney problems and hyperviscosity syndrome.  This skin condition may be observed in patients with the following condtions, such as primary polycythemic hyperviscosity (polycythemia, thrombocytemia) treated with hydroxyurea, primary plasma hyperviscosity (multiple myeloma, cryoglobulinemia, cryofibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia, and connective tissue diseases), primary sclerocythemic hyperviscosity (hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, and sickle cell disease).   A 73-year-old woman with known MM who received little treatment for several years, presented secondary to dysarthria and at first was thought to have hyperviscosity syndrome.   After a comprehensive evaluation ruled out common causes of acute renal failure, the patient underwent testing with a bone survey, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), and immunoelectrophoresis for suspected plasma cell dyscrasia and received plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome and nephrotoxicity, which resulted in improved renal function. Lab results showed monoclonal gammopathy, elevated serum free light chains, and Bence Jones protein in the urine with a follow-up bone marrow biopsy indicating plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient received a diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) and was started on chemotherapy and immunosuppression.  Plasmapheresis (PE) is recommended for patients with hyperviscosity syndrome or cast nephropathy presented with AKI, which may help to increase the dialysis-independency. Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder resulting from malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. It can cause a hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to the paraproteinaemia associated with the disease. The increased hyperviscosity can lead to retinal vein occlusions and other ocular problems that may challenge clinicians.  Etiologies are various but symptomatic hyperviscosity is more common in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma.  Double filtration plasmapheresis in a dog with multiple myeloma and hyperviscosity syndrome. A 12 year old, 38 kg, mix-breed, intact male dog presented with a 20 day history of clinical signs consistent with hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to multiple myeloma.  The present study reported for the first time the use of double filtration plasmapheresis to reduce clinical signs of hyperviscosity syndrome in a dog with multiple myeloma. An otherwise healthy young man presents with bilateral CRVO as the first sign of hyperviscosity syndrome in the setting of new multiple myeloma.  In haematology the most common indication for plasmapheresis is the supportive treatment of multiple myeloma. The procedure is performed in patients with high protein levels endangered with hyperviscosity syndrome. Five to 10 percent of patients with multiple myeloma are suffered from the hyperviscosity syndrome because of increased serum viscosity due to the presence of myeloma protein. Plasmapheresis is known as an efficient method for rapid improvement of the hyperviscosity syndrome, and double filtration plasmapheresis is most commonly used for plasma exchange of multiple myeloma patients in our country. PE is the most effective method in the treatment of hyperviscosity syndrome often seen with multiple myeloma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and it is therapy of choice for this complication. Patients with multiple myeloma who have complications secondary to hyperviscosity are treated by chemotherapy and/or plasmapheresis."
Does the human lncRNA LINC-PINT promote tumorigenesis?,no,"The human lncRNA LINC-PINT inhibits tumor cell invasion through a highly conserved sequence element. Here we characterize the function of the p53-regulated human lncRNA LINC-PINT in cancer. We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. A cross-species analysis identifies a highly conserved sequence element in LINC-PINT that is essential for its function. This sequence mediates a specific interaction with PRC2, necessary for the LINC-PINT-dependent repression of a pro-invasion signature of genes regulated by the transcription factor EGR1. We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. These results thus indicate that low plasma Linc-pint expression could serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for early PCa detection, and that low Linc-pint levels in PCa tumors could be used for predicting patient prognosis. Our data demonstrate that Linc-pint expression is lower in plasma samples from PCa patients than from healthy individuals, and indicate that plasma Linc-pint levels are more sensitive than CA19-9 for detecting PCa. Low plasma Linc-pint levels correlate with tumor recurrence, while low tumor Linc-pint levels correlate with poor prognosis for PCa patients after pancreatectomy. We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.

Doesn't Evolocumab improve cognitive function?,yes,"Conclusions In a randomized trial involving patients who received either evolocumab or placebo in addition to statin therapy, no significant between-group difference in cognitive function was observed over a median of 19 months.  Results A total of 1204 patients were followed for a median of 19 months; the mean (±SD) change from baseline over time in the raw score for the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (primary end point) was -0.21±2.62 in the evolocumab group and -0.29±2.81 in the placebo group (P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.85 for superiority).

Can't radius fracture cause carpal tunnel syndrome?,no,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) after distal radius fractures can present in 3 forms: acute, transient, and delayed. Complications were categorized as carpal tunnel syndrome, other sensibility issues, tendon complications including irritation and rupture, deep infections, complex regional pain syndrome and unidentified DRUJ or scapholunar problems. The overall complication rate was 14.6% (95% CI 11.8-17.7) including carpal tunnel syndrome or change in sensibility in 5.2% and tendon complications in 4.7%.  BACKGROUND: Although median nerve neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are known complications of both untreated and acutely treated distal radius fracture, median neuropathy after correction of distal radius malunion is not commonly reported in hand surgery literature.  Complications were defined as malunion, carpal tunnel syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), persistent pain, and subjective cosmetic deformity of the wrist. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common complication associated with distal radius fractures. The patient also had minor complications of little finger flexor tendon irritation and carpal tunnel syndrome. She underwent implant removal and carpal tunnel release at 8 months. Acute multiple flexor tendon injury and carpal tunnel syndrome after open distal radius fracture. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition and is a well-recognized phenomenon following a distal radius fracture. We report the incidence of late onset post-operative carpal tunnel syndrome (late carpal tunnel syndrome) and late median nerve neuropathy after volar plating of distal radius fracture by conducting a retrospective study on volar plating for distal radius fracture performed during 2002 to 2006.

Can't Logic Alignment Free (LAF) be used for bacterial genomes classification?,no,"LAF: Logic Alignment Free and its application to bacterial genomes classification. In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa. This method searches for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules). We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules, each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it. In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa.

Isn't there an association between Klinefelter syndrome and breast cancer?,no,"Screening for breast cancer in male-to-female transsexuals should be undertaken for those with additional risk factors (e.g., family history, BRCA2 mutation, Klinefelter syndrome) and should be available to those who desire screening, preferably in a clinical trial. Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24.7; 95% CI = 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9.78; 95% CI = 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI.  Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome.  The main risk factors include: the mutation of genes BRCA 1 and 2, Klinefelter's syndrome, alcohol, liver disease, obesity.  Although aetiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2) risk factors are already known.  The largest study found 19.2- and 57.8-fold increases in incidence and mortality, respectively, with particularly high risks among 47,XXY mosaics.  CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify which patients with KS are at a high risk of developing MBC and to distinguish between possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones. Major risk factors for developing male BC include clinical disorders involving hormonal imbalances (excess of estrogen or a deficiency of testosterone as seen in patients with Klinefelter syndrome) and a positive family history for breast cancer.  Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia.  Breast cancer in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome is reported. The increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol at the therapy with androgens might be responsible for the development of breast cancer in Klinefelter's syndrome. Patients with a 47,XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have an increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer and germ cell tumors, but rarely malignant hematologic disorders. The frequencies of diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and germ cell neoplasia increases in Klinefelter's syndrome. There is evidence, however, to suggest that Klinefelter's males have an increased risk of breast cancer that approaches three percent. Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC).<br><b>CASE REPORT</b>: We report a 54-year old man was diagnosed as synchronous bilateral breast cancer with Klinefelter syndrome. These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer. Major genetic factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for men include BRCA2 mutations, which are believed to account for the majority of inherited breast cancer in men, Klinefelter syndrome, and a positive family history. Those affected by Klinefelter's syndrome are at increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer. Compared with the general population, men with Klinefelter syndrome had higher mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.0), breast cancer (SMR = 57.8, 95% CI = 18.8 to 135.0), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 6.6) and lower mortality from prostate cancer (SMR = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 0.7). Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC). Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome. Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia.

Isn't vorinostat effective for glioblastoma?,yes,"Conclusions: Vorinostat combined with standard chemoradiation had acceptable tolerability in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Although the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, vorinostat sensitivity and resistance signatures could facilitate patient selection in future trials. LESSONS LEARNED: Combination regimen with bevacizumab (BEV) and vorinostat is well tolerated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. CONCLUSION: Combination treatment of BEV and VOR was well tolerated. This combination therapy for this study population did not improve PFS6 or median OS when compared with BEV monotherapy. We present two patients with glioblastoma multiforme who developed severe hemolytic anemia shortly after initiating therapy with vorinostat, a pan-active histone deacetylase inhibitor, while on prophylactic dapsone. Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor that entered clinical trials in glioblastoma, showing activity in recurrent disease. Multiple phase II trials with vorinostat in combination with targeted agents, temozolomide and radiotherapy are currently recruiting.  . On the basis of the results of this phase II study, further evaluation of the vorinostat-bortezomib combination in GBM patients in this dose and schedule is not recommended. ith the increased toxicities associated with CPT-11 coupled with its unclear clinical significance, investigating the efficacy of vorinostat combined with bevacizumab alone may represent a more promising strategy to evaluate in the context of a phase II clinical trial. CONCLUSION: Vorinostat in combination with temozolomide is well tolerated in patients with HGG. A phase I/II trial of vorinostat with radiotherapy and concomitant TMZ in newly diagnosed glioblastoma is underway."
Are patients with Sjogren syndrome at increased risk for lymphoma?,yes,"The heightened risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development in primary Sjogren syndrome (SS) is well established. Primary Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma of the Liver in a Patient with Sjogren Syndrome. Immunohistochemical and molecular features of the tumors allowed diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  To our knowledge, the patient described here represents the first reported case of DLBCL with primary liver involvement in SS. Rituximab is also effective in the treatment of SS-associated (extrasalivary) lymphomas, although the therapeutic response in salivary lymphoma is poorer. Rituximab treatment for Sjogren syndrome-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: case series. Five per cent of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) develop malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), usually of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and most frequently located in the major salivary glands.  [A case of Sjogren syndrome coexistent with MALT lymphoma occurring along the parotid gland and trachea]. Both histological examinations revealed MALT-type marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.  In the majority of patients, it is a late event and frequently associated with systemic disease or risk factors for lymphoma development. The incidence of lymphoma is higher in patients with Sjögren's syndrome than in the general population. Among the clinical and serological parameters that have been associated with lymphoma development in SS patients, the presence of palpable purpura, low C4, and mixed monoclonal cryoglobulinemia constitute the main predictive markers, and patients displaying these risk factors should be monitored closely. A case of pulmonary pseudolymphoma and Sjogren syndrome is presented. Furthermore, RA, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and possibly celiac disease may share an association with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in addition to well-established links of Sjögren's syndrome with risk of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and of celiac disease with risk of small intestinal lymphoma. Predicting the risk for lymphoma development in Sjogren syndrome: An easy tool for clinical use. Lymphoma is a very severe complication of primary Sjögren's syndrome: 5 to 10% of patients followed for more than 10 years will develop a lymphoma. Hematologic manifestations and predictors of lymphoma development in primary Sjögren syndrome: clinical and pathophysiologic aspects. Recent results clearly indicate an association between severity of chronic inflammation and lymphoma risk in RA and Sjögren's syndrome. Several autoimmune diseases, including primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), are associated with an increased risk for lymphoma. Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) confers increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development. Furthermore, we review the emerging role of ELS and lymphoid chemokines in driving extranodal B cell lymphomagenesis in SS and we focus on recent evidence suggesting that ELS identify subsets of SS patients at increased risk of developing systemic manifestations and lymphoma. Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder with the highest risk for lymphoma development among all autoimmune diseases. In contrast to secondary SS, the risk for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is highly increased in patients with primary SS. Predicting the risk for lymphoma development in Sjogren syndrome: An easy tool for clinical use. Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is complicated by B-cell lymphoma in 5-10% of patients. Patients with Sjögren syndrome are at increased risk of lymphoma development. Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease with a known predisposition for lymphoma development. Certain autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Sjögren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have consistently been associated with an increased risk of malignant lymphomas, but it is unclear whether elevated lymphoma risk is a phenomenon that accompanies inflammatory conditions in general."
"Down's syndrome occurs when an individual has an extra copy or part of a copy of chromosome 21, yes or no?",yes,"Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) is the most common survivable disorder due to aneuploidy. Down syndrome (DS), trisomy 21, is caused by increased dose of genes present on human chromosome 21 (HSA21) Down syndrome, or Trisomy 21, is the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormality in live-born children.  Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, Submicroscopic duplication of chromosome 21 and trisomy 21 phenotype (Down syndrome). Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder resulting from the presence of all or part of an extra Chromosome 21. Down syndrome is a genetic disorder, occurring when an individual has all or part of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Downs syndrome (DS) occurs due to an extra copy of chromosome 21. Down syndrome, which arises in individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21, is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease. Aneuploidy refers to the presence of an extra copy of a specific chromosome, or trisomy, as seen in Down's syndrome (trisomy 21), or the absence of a single chromosome, or monosomy, as seen in Turner syndrome (a single X chromosome in females: 45, X). Down syndrome (DS) or Trisomy 21 (Ts21) is caused by the presence of an extra copy of all or part of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and is the most frequent survivable congenital chromosomal abnormality. Down syndrome (DS) is a major cause of mental retardation and heart disease. Although it is usually caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21, a subset of the diagnostic features may be caused by the presence of only band 21q22. Down syndrome is usually caused by complete trisomy 21. Down syndrome, the most frequent genetic disorder, is characterized by an extra copy of all or part of chromosome 21. Down syndrome (DS), caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, affects 1 in 750 live births and is characterized by cognitive impairment and a constellation of congenital defects. Down syndrome (DS) results from one extra copy of human chromosome 21 and leads to several alterations including intellectual disabilities and locomotor defects. Down's syndrome results from the production of three copies of chromosome 21 within a cell.  Downs syndrome (DS) occurs due to an extra copy of chromosome 21. Trisomy 21 (Ts21) is the most common live-born human aneuploidy; it results in a constellation of features known as Down's syndrome (DS).

Is creatinine assessment included in the MELD score?,yes,"Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores were calculated as 3.78×ln[TB] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 9.57×ln[creatinine] + 6.43.  A corrected creatinine was derived from the mGFR after application of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Subsequently, a corrected MELD was calculated and compared with the conventionally calculated MELD. Among patients with MELD score>35, a new prognostic model based on serum creatinine, need for hemodialysis and moderate ascites could identify the sickest one. Patient risk factors evaluated include age, INR (international normalized ratio), creatinine, bilirubin, and MELD score (Model for End-of-stage Liver Disease).  Limited comparability of creatinine assays in patients with liver cirrhosis and their impact on the MELD score. The model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is used for this purpose in most countries and incorporates bilirubin, International Normalized ratio, and creatinine.  The MELD score was calculated using international normalized ratio, serum billirubin and creatinine. Regression analysis identified high creatinine and INR, but not bilirubin, as the MELD components predicting negative outcomes with ELAD.  This study aimed to evaluate the impact of two creatinine measurement methods on the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and glomerular filtration rate estimation (eGFR) in cirrhotic patients. <b>OBJECTIVES</b>: The model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD = 3.8*LN[total bilirubin] + 9.6*LN[creatinine] + 11.2*[PT-INR] + 6.4) predicts mortality for tricuspid valve surgery.

Can doxycycline cause photosensitivity?,yes,"Phototoxicity of Doxycycline: A Systematic Review on Clinical Manifestations, Frequency, Cofactors, and Prevention. BACKGROUND: One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity.  While there are many publications on the phototoxicity of tetracyclines in general, only a few exist focusing on doxycycline.  Clinical symptoms vary from light sunburn-like sensation (burning, erythema) to large-area photodermatitis.  CONCLUSION: Evidence base must be improved for giving advice on appropriate prevention measures to travelers taking doxycycline and having a risk of significant sun exposure. Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush. Many drugs are responsible for this phototoxic reaction, especially tetracyclines, psoralens, chloramphenicol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluoroquinolones, and, rarely, doxycycline.  OBJECTIVES: Many patients undergoing long-term doxycycline treatment do not regularly take their treatment because of photosensitivity. Modulation of Melanogenesis and Antioxidant Status of Melanocytes in Response to Phototoxic Action of Doxycycline. Doxycycline is a commonly used tetracycline antibiotic showing the broad spectrum of antibacterial action. However, the use of this antibiotic is often connected with the risk of phototoxic reactions that lead to various skin disorders. The results obtained in vitro may explain the mechanisms of phototoxic reactions that occur in normal human epidermal melanocytes in vivo after exposure of skin to doxycycline and UVA radiation. Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone.<br> <b>OBJECTIVES</b>: Many patients undergoing long-term doxycycline treatment do not regularly take their treatment because of photosensitivity. Photosensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted more often among patients receiving doxycycline than in those receiving ceftriaxone. Thus, the action spectra of the drug photosensitivity patients were plotted and compared with those of 12 nonphotosensitive control patients: 10 patients were found to be photosensitive in the UVA range; the implicated drugs included quinine, sparfloxacin, amiodarone, doxycycline, mefenamic acid, nalidixic acid, fenbrufen, diclofenac, enalapril, diltiazem and prochlorperazine maleate. One patient on doxycycline was photosensitive in both the UVA and UVB ranges. Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone. Anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines or increased photosensitivity, or by pregnant or nursing women (anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline is a pregnancy category-D medication). <b>BACKGROUND</b>: One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity. One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity. One patient experienced mild photosensitivity from doxycycline but continued to take it. Participants in the doxycycline group had a higher incidence of nausea and photosensitivity. Photosensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted more often among patients receiving doxycycline than in those receiving ceftriaxone."
Aren't paralog genes co-regulated?,no,"Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. In eukaryotes, genes are regulated in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters. These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization. Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs. Analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster testes transcriptome reveals coordinate regulation of paralogous genes. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.<br> Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear.

We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances.  MiRNA genes are often subject to co-evolutionary changes together with their target transcripts, which may be reflected by differences between paralog mouse and primate miRNA/mRNA pairs. We characterize the collapse over time through the distribution of runs of reduced paralog pairs in duplicated segments. In addition, we identified 81 co-regulated regions on the human genome (RIDGEs) by using expression data from all cancers. Some RIDGEs (28%) consist of paralog genes while another subset (30%) are specifically dysregulated in tumors but not in normal tissues. We conclude that the similarity of hoxb3a/Hoxa3 regulatory mechanisms reflect the shared descent of both genes from a single ancestral paralog group 3 gene. Conserved co-regulation and promoter sharing of hoxb3a and hoxb4a in zebrafish. By analyzing paralogs of testis-biased genes, we identified ""co-regulated"" paralogous pairs in which both genes are testis biased, ""anti-regulated"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other downregulated in testes, and ""neutral"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other constitutively expressed."

Are there ways of joint Bayesian inference of risk variants?,yes,"Joint Bayesian inference of risk variants and tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments across multiple complex human diseases. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful approach for uncovering disease-associated variants in human, but fine-mapping the causal variants remains a challenge. This is partly remedied by prioritization of disease-associated variants that overlap GWAS-enriched epigenomic annotations. Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants from summary statistics across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations. In simulation, RiVIERA promising power in detecting causal variants and causal annotations, the multi-trait joint inference further improved the detection power. We applied RiVIERA to model the existing GWAS summary statistics of 9 autoimmune diseases and Schizophrenia by jointly harnessing the potential causal enrichments among 848 tissue-specific epigenomics annotations from ENCODE/Roadmap consortium covering 127 cell/tissue types and 8 major epigenomic marks. RiVIERA identified meaningful tissue-specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for Blood T-Cell specifically in the nine autoimmune diseases and Brain-specific enhancer activities exclusively in Schizophrenia. Moreover, the variants from the 95% credible sets exhibited high conservation and enrichments for GTEx whole-blood eQTLs located within transcription-factor-binding-sites and DNA-hypersensitive-sites.

Isn't subacute sclerosing panencephalitis caused by the Measles vaccine?,yes,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a potentially fatal complication of measles.  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal complication of measles. We reviewed California cases from 1998-2015 to understand risk f Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis should be eliminated by measles vaccination The mean interval between measles infection and onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was 6.5 years (range = 3-11 years). Active surveillance of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis for those with measles infection during the 1988 outbreak is necessary to conduct multicenter drug trials for this devastating disease.<br> There has been an increasing trend of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in southern China after the measles outbreak in 1988. The prevalence rate of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in Hong Kong and Macau in 2002 was 1 per million total population or 5.5 per million children. Because a positive correlation was found between the prevalence of measles and the onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, particularly among children infected at an early age, it is vital to eradicate measles infection by vaccination.<br> Incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis following measles and measles vaccination in Japan.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), in the majority of cases, is caused by the wild measles virus, although there are some reports relating SSPE to vaccination. Measles can persist in the central nervous system and cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a progressive disease that is almost always fatal. However, because of the median 8-year interval between measles and onset of SSPE, The prevention of endemic circulation of measles virus in England and Wales through the high coverage achieved with MMR vaccine, together with the measles/rubella vaccination campaign of 1994, has resulted in the near elimination of SSPE. We applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the measles virus genome in specimens from a 12-year-old boy with SSPE who had received measles vaccine 10 years before and had no history of apparent natural measles. The oligonucleotide primers for PCR were prepared based on the nucleotide sequence of the F and NP genes of the measles virus Edmonston strain.RESULTS: F and NP genes were detected in both the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analysis of the F gene showed that the patient's virus was different from that of the vaccine strain.

Can't CD55 deficiency cause thrombosis?,no,"The loss of CD55 and CD59 renders PNH erythrocytes susceptible to intravascular haemolysis, which can lead to thrombosis and to much of the morbidity and mortality of PNH.  CD55 Deficiency, Early-Onset Protein-Losing Enteropathy, and Thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.  It is caused by the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene that results in deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor structure responsible for fixing a wide spectrum of proteins particularly CD55 and CD59. The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. The lack of one of the GPI-AP complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) leads to hemolysis. The disease is diagnosed with hemolytic anemia, marrow failure and thrombosis. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder that manifests with hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood cytopenias. The absence of two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, CD55 and CD59, leads to uncontrolled complement activation that accounts for hemolysis and other PNH manifestations. RESULTS: CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1.6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1.0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4.7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT. Data of this study indicate that the PNH defect as detected with CD55, CD59, and CD16 is not an important cause of intra-abdominal thrombosis in northwestern India. PNH testing of red blood cells revealed a CD55 and CD59 deficiency consistent with PNH in both cases. The systemic complications typically associated with thrombosis were not observed for the following several months with early conservative treatments including eculizumab. Deficiency of the GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation. Apart from hemolysis, another prominent feature is a highly increased risk of thrombosis. Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.

Are sleep apnea and snoring associated with cardiac arrhythmias?,yes,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common breathing disorder, is an independent risk factor for AF. There is a growing consensus in the scientific community that suggests a strong association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular (CVD) conditions and events, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.  part from well-established risk factors that increase the odds for the development of AF, e.g. age or arterial hypertension, recent analyses indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may independently, negatively modify the arrhythmia occur-rence profile.  Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke. Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.<br> Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation. Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting 5-15% of the population. It is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that disrupts normal ventilation and sleep architecture, and is typically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea present risk to the general public safety by causing 8-fold increase in vehicle accidents, and they may themselves also suffer from the physiologic consequences of OSA; these include hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias Obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration                     are associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia.  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects approximately 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in patients with OSA, even though the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined.  Cardiac arrhythmias during wakefulness and sleep in 15 patients with sleep-induced obstructive apnea, and the effect of atropine and tracheostomy on these arrhythmias were studied by continuous overnight Holter electrocardiographic, respiratory and electroencephalographic recordings. obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as its most extreme variant, is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway, leading to cessation of breathing while asleep. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in OSA patients, although the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined The mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea include abrupt changes in autonomic tone, which can trigger cardiac arrhythmias.   Recent studies have shown that cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders are common in patients with SA. Sleep apnea Severity of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias correlates with intensity of sleep apnea in men Patients affected with OSA are frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with stable cardiac failure who snore may present sleep hypopnea and cardiac arrhythmias.   Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA.  Nocturnal hypoxia has been associated with serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as life-threatening bradyarrhythmias. Obesity and snoring, both of which increase with age, have been identified as risk factors for sleep-related breathing disorders, as have hypertension and heart disease. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with excess daytime sleepiness, depression, and an increased incidence of ischemic cardiopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension and brain infarction. We found 58 percent prevalence of arrhythmias in patients with sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index = AHI>10), vs 42 percent in nonapneic controls (chi 2 = 16.7, p<0.0001)"
Doesn't temsirolimus improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,yes,"RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus was not superior to temozolomide in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter. The actuarial 1-year survival was 72.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 58.2-82.2] in the temozolomide arm and 69.6% (95% CI, 55.8-79.9) in the temsirolimus arm [hazard ratio (HR) 1.16; 95% CI, 0.77-1.76; P = 0.47]. CONCLUSION: The combination of bevacizumab with temsirolimus was well-tolerated and resulted in stable disease of at least four months/partial response in three out of six pediatric patients with chemorefractory CNS tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus administered weekly at the dose of 75 mg/m(2) did not meet the primary objective efficacy threshold in children with high-grade glioma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma; however, meaningful prolonged stable disease merits further evaluation in combination therapy. Novel targeted agents such as bevacizumab, imatinib, erlotinib, temsirolimus, immunotherapy, cilengitide, talampanel, etc. are helping classical chemotherapeutic agents, like temozolomide, to achieve an increase in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: CCI-779 was well tolerated at this dose schedule; however, there was no evidence of efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival. CONCLUSIONS Temsirolimus was not superior to temozolomide in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter. The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival."
Aren't there sex differences in the transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus?,no,"To better understand the possible molecular basis for the sex-biased nature of neurological disorders, we used a developmental series of female and male mice at 1, 2, and 4 months of age to assess both mRNA and protein in the hippocampus with RNA-sequencing and mass-spectrometry, respectively. The bulk of these differentially expressed genes are changed in both sexes at one or more ages, but a total of 198 transcripts are differentially expressed between females and males at one or more ages. The number of transcripts that are differentially expressed between females and males is greater in adult animals than in younger animals. Additionally, we identify 69 transcripts that show complex and sex-specific patterns of temporal regulation through postnatal development, 8 of which are heat-shock proteins.  Additionally, this analysis reveals sex differences in the transcriptome of the developing mouse hippocampus, and further clarifies the need to include both female and male mice in longitudinal studies involving molecular changes in the hippocampus."
"A bite from the Lone Star Tick Amblyomma americanum, can cause the victim to become allergic to red meat, yes or no?",yes,"A recent discovery of an IgE antibody specific to galactose-α-1,3-galactose, which is a carbohydrate abundantly expressed on cells and tissues of beef, pork, and lamb, adds one more tool to aid the clinician in making the appropriate diagnosis.

Is there a link between nuclear position and DNA repair pathway choice?,yes,"Nuclear position dictates DNA repair pathway choice. We demonstrate that DSBs induced at the nuclear membrane (but not at nuclear pores or nuclear interior) fail to rapidly activate the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair by homologous recombination (HR). Real-time and superresolution imaging reveal that DNA DSBs within lamina-associated domains do not migrate to more permissive environments for HR, like the nuclear pores or the nuclear interior, but instead are repaired in situ by alternative end-joining. Our results are consistent with a model in which nuclear position dictates the choice of DNA repair pathway, thus revealing a new level of regulation in DSB repair controlled by spatial organization of DNA within the nucleus.

Is there any role of interleukin-11 in cardiovascular fibrosis?,yes,"IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis. Using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, we found that Interleukin 11 (IL11) upregulation is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFB1 exposure and required for its profibrotic effect. IL11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts where they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 is protective against disease. Thus, inhibition of IL11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These data reveal a central role of IL11 in fibrosis and we propose inhibition of IL11 as a new therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases. IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis."

Isn't Enlimomab effective for stroke treatment?,yes,"However, this treatment failed to show benefit in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial. There was no increase in the frequency of adverse events with increasing doses of enlimomab.CONCLUSIONS: Doses of enlimomab between 140 and 480 mg administered over 5 days did not increase the risk of adverse events in patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke during an observation period of 30 +/- 10 days. Examination of several potential mechanisms for the negative outcome in a clinical stroke trial of enlimomab, a murine anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 antibody: a bedside-to-bench study. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enlimomab, a murine monoclonal anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 antibody, had a negative outcome in a multicenter acute-stroke trial.  These observations provide several possible mechanisms for central nervous system-related clinical deterioration that occurred when Enlimomab was given in acute ischemic stroke. Fewer patients had symptom-free recovery on enlimomab than placebo (p = 0.004), and more died (22.2 versus 16.2%). The negative effect of enlimomab was apparent on days 5, 30, and 90 of treatment (p = 0.005). There were significantly more adverse events with enlimomab treatment than placebo, primarily infections and fever.  CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that anti-ICAM therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome. Patients experiencing fever were more likely to have a poor outcome or die.The authors conclude that anti-ICAM therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome.

Doesn't International Citicoline Trial on acUte Stroke trial supports efficacy of citicoline for stroke treatment?,yes,"The meta-analysis showed that no significant differences were found in the long-term mortality (OR=0.91, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.09, P=0.30), the rate of dependency (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24, P=0.85), and the effective rate (OR=0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14, P=0.82) between citicoline group and control group.   In conclusion, citicolne cannot reduce long-term mortality and dependence rate in the treatment of acute stroke, and the effective rate of citivoline may be not better than that of controls but with reliable safety. In humans, although a recent trial International Citicoline Trial on Acute Stroke (ICTUS) has shown that global recovery is similar in CDP-choline and placebo groups, CDP-choline was shown to be more beneficial in some patients, such as those with moderate stroke severity and not treated with t-PA.  INTERPRETATION: Under the circumstances of the ICTUS trial, citicoline is not efficacious in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute ischaemic stroke. The trial was stopped for futility at the third interim analysis on the basis of complete data from 2078 patients. Global recovery was similar in both groups (odds ratio 1·03, 95% CI 0·86-1·25; p=0·364).

Is recursive splicing more common in short introns?,no,"Recent work in human and fruitfly tissues revealed that long introns are extensively processed cotranscriptionally and in a stepwise manner, before their two flanking exons are spliced together Cutting a Long Intron Short: Recursive Splicing and Its Implications.  Furthermore, we uncover the potential to investigate the multi-step nature of splicing, assessing various types of recursive splicing events Recursive splicing is a process in which large introns are removed in multiple steps by re-splicing at ratchet points--5' splice sites recreated after splicing. Together, these results indicate that recursive splicing is commonly used in Drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the mechanisms by which some large introns are removed. Recursive splicing in long vertebrate genes. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates.  The peculiarities of large intron splicing in animals. These ""large introns"" must be spliced out of the pre-mRNA in a timely fashion, which involves bringing together distant 5' and 3' acceptor and donor splice sites. Using a computational analysis of the genomic sequences, we show that vertebrates lack the proper enrichment of RP-sites in their large introns, and, therefore, require some other method to aid splicing Subdivision of large introns in Drosophila by recursive splicing at nonexonic elements. Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of introns>20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within introns<10 kb. These transcripts arise by use of two alternative transcription sites and complex alternative splicing mechanisms and encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains and a common internal domain where the RGS domain is found. These patterns of enrichment and conservation indicate that recursive splice sites are advantageous in the context of long introns. Many genes with important roles in development and disease contain exceptionally long introns, but special mechanisms for their expression have not been investigated. However, some long Drosophila melanogaster introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing. The effect of splice site strength was context-dependent and much more significant for the 3' splice site of the longer alternative intron than for the 3' splice site of the shorter alternative intron and the common 5' splice sites; it was also more significant in the rat minigene than in the mouse minigene.

We show here that the redox-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel TRPM2 is expressed in the phagosomal membrane and regulates macrophage bactericidal activity through the activation of phagosomal acidification The transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress sensing channel that is expressed in a number of inflammatory cells and therefore it has been suggested that inhibition of TRPM2 could lead to a beneficial effect in COPD patients. TRPM2 is a recently identified TRPM family cation channel which is unique among known ion channels in that it contains a C-terminal domain which is homologous to the NUDT9 ADP-ribose hydrolase and possesses intrinsic ADP-ribose hydrolase activity These results suggest that TRPM2 may participate in antigen-induced extracellular Ca(2+) influx and subsequent degranulation. In addition, TRPM2 inhibitors were shown to improve food allergic reactions in a mouse model. Together, these results suggest that TRPM2 inhibitors suppress MMC degranulation via regulation of the increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt.
