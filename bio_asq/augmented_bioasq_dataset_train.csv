Does International Citicoline Trial on acUte Stroke trial supports efficacy of citicoline for stroke treatment?,no,"The meta-analysis showed that no significant differences were found in the long-term mortality (OR=0.91, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.09, P=0.30), the rate of dependency (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24, P=0.85), and the effective rate (OR=0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14, P=0.82) between citicoline group and control group.   In conclusion, citicolne cannot reduce long-term mortality and dependence rate in the treatment of acute stroke, and the effective rate of citivoline may be not better than that of controls but with reliable safety. In humans, although a recent trial International Citicoline Trial on Acute Stroke (ICTUS) has shown that global recovery is similar in CDP-choline and placebo groups, CDP-choline was shown to be more beneficial in some patients, such as those with moderate stroke severity and not treated with t-PA.  INTERPRETATION: Under the circumstances of the ICTUS trial, citicoline is not efficacious in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute ischaemic stroke. The trial was stopped for futility at the third interim analysis on the basis of complete data from 2078 patients. Global recovery was similar in both groups (odds ratio 1·03, 95% CI 0·86-1·25; p=0·364). INTERPRETATION Under the circumstances of the ICTUS trial, citicoline is not efficacious in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute ischaemic stroke. In humans, although a recent trial International Citicoline Trial on Acute Stroke (ICTUS) has shown that global recovery is similar in CDP-choline and placebo groups, CDP-choline was shown to be more beneficial in some patients, such as those with moderate stroke severity and not treated with t-PA. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial actions of CDP-choline. In humans, although a recent trial International Citicoline Trial on Acute Stroke (ICTUS) has shown that global recovery is similar in CDP-choline and placebo groups, CDP-choline was shown to be more beneficial in some patients, such as those with moderate stroke severity and not treated with t-PA."
Have germline variants been associated to colorectal cancer?,yes,"Overall, we identified aberrant transcripts in 8% of the patients (familial cases 30%; early-onset manifestation 21%). In eight of them, two different out-of-frame pseudoexons were found consisting of a 167-bp insertion from intron 4 in five families with a shared founder haplotype and a 83-bp insertion from intron 10 in three patients. The pseudoexon formation was caused by three different heterozygous germline mutations, which are supposed to activate cryptic splice sites We apply OS-Seq to resequence the exons of either 10 or 344 cancer genes from human DNA samples. In our assessment of capture performance, >87% of the captured sequence originated from the intended target region with sequencing coverage falling within a tenfold range for a majority of all targets. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) called from OS-Seq data agreed with >95% of variants obtained from whole-genome sequencing of the same individual. The minor alleles of CD44 rs8193 C>T, ALCAM rs1157 G>A, and LGR5 rs17109924 T>C were significantly associated with increased TTR (9.4 vs. 5.4 years; HR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.35-0.93; P = 0.022; 11.3 vs. 5.7 years; HR, 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33-0.94; P = 0.024, and 10.7 vs. 5.7 years; HR, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.12-0.90; P = 0.023, respectively) and remained significant in the multivariate analysis stratified by ethnicity. In recursive partitioning, a specific gene variant profile including LGR5 rs17109924, CD44 rs8193, and ALDH1A1 rs1342024 represented a high-risk subgroup with a median TTR of 1.7 years (HR, 6.71, 95% CI: 2.71-16.63, P < 0.001). In this study, we identified common germline variants in VEGF-dependent and -independent angiogenesis genes predicting clinical outcome and tumor response in patients with mCRC receiving first-line bevacizumab and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. We identified 22 nonsynonymous somatic mutations of which the majority was of missense type. In germline, three novel nonsynonymous variants were identified in the following genes: CSMD3, EPHB6 and C10orf137, and none of the variants were present in 890 population-matched healthy controls. It is possible that the identified germline variants modulate predisposition to CRC. One patient proved to carry an APC whole-gene deletion; 4 of 25 (16%) patients showed biallelic and 3 of 25 (12%) monoallelic MUTYH mutations. In the three heterozygous subjects no pathogenetic variants were found in OGG1, MTH1, APE1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes. Frequency assessment of MUTYH mutations in healthy subjects showed that only Y165C and G382D reach a subpolymorphic frequency. Scrutinizing the molecular genetic results and family data of 242 index patients with pathogenic APC mutations led to the identification of 10 mosaic cases (4%). C>T transitions were observed in CGA sites in four of the 10 cases with somatic mosaicism, which is significantly more than 26 of the 232 non-mosaic cases (p = 0.02). Phenotypes of patients with somatic mosaicism ranged from an attenuated form of polyposis coli to florid polyposis with major extracolonic manifestations. Altogether 12 previously reported changes and four novel genetic alterations, mostly in intronic sequences, were identified. The results revealed the presence of biallelic germline MYH mutations in two patients. These patients were compound heterozygotes for two of the most common germline mutations c.494 A>G (p.Y165C); c.1,145 G>A (p.G382D). These variants are established to be associated with adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer."
Can't valproic acid prolong survival of glioblastoma patients?,no,"For patients who presented with epilepsy, the use of the antiepileptic drug VPA did not associate with survival when compared with patients who did not receive VPA treatment. This prognostic effect is not solely explained by early diagnosis, and survival is not associated with VPA treatment. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have indicated that VPA has radiosensitizing effects for gliomas and radioprotective influence on normal brain tissue or hippocampal neurons. The results of several retrospective studies have also indicated potential benefit to improve survival of patients with GBM. Moreover, the promising treatment results of a phase 2 trial of concurrent radiation therapy, temozolomide, and VPA for patients with GBM have been recently reported.  While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients.  Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylase Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma. Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival. Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16.9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93).  Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylase. Several uncontrolled retrospective case series and a post hoc analysis of the registration trial for temozolomide indicated an association between valproic acid (VPA) use and improved survival outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.To confirm the hypothesis suggested above, a combined analysis of survival association of antiepileptic drug use at the start of chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide was performed in the pooled patient cohort (n = 1,869) of four contemporary randomized clinical trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma: AVAGlio (Avastin in Glioblastoma; NCT00943826), CENTRIC (Cilengitide, Temozolomide, and Radiation T Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients. Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16.9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93).VPA may be preferred over an EIAED in patients with glioblastoma who require an AED during TMZ-based chemoradiotherapy. The combination of radiotherapy, temozolomide and valproic acid (VPA) has shown some promise in retrospective analyses of patients with glioblastoma, although their mechanisms of action remain unknown.We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of pretreating glioma cells with temozolomide and VPA as an immunization strategy to boost an adaptive immune response in a syngeneic mouse model.Temozolomide and VPA induced autophagy in GL261 glioma cells, and caused tumor antigen-specific T-cells to become activated effector T-cells. Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma."
Doesn't GC content vary markedly within a given isochore?,yes,"The isochore, a large DNA sequence with relatively small GC variance, is one of the most important structures in eukaryotic genomes. Isochores are large regions of relatively homogeneous nucleotide composition Vertebrate genomes are comprised of isochores that are relatively long (>100 kb) regions with a relatively homogenous (either GC-rich or AT-rich) base composition and with rather sharp boundaries with neighboring isochores. The human genome is composed of large sequence segments with fairly homogeneous GC content, namely isochores Isochores, i.e. stretches of DNA with a distinct sequence composition and thus a specific GC content The human genome is composed of long stretches of DNA with distinct GC contents, called isochores or GC-content domains. The human genome is divided into isochores, large stretches (>>300 kb) of genomic DNA with more or less consistent GC content.  Many eukaryotic genomes contain isochore regions, mosaics of homogeneous GC content that can abruptly change from one neighboring isochore to the next. One of the most striking features of mammalian and birds chromosomes is the variation in the guanine-cytosine (GC) content that occurs over scales of hundreds of kilobases to megabases; this is known as the ""isochore"" structure. The segmentation analysis shows that there are stronger indications of GC content changes at isochore borders than within an isochore. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them. An isochore sequence may pass a homogeneity test when GC content fluctuations at smaller length scales are ignored or averaged out. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them"
Does melanoma  occur in people of African origin ?,yes,"ALM is the most common type of melanoma amongst Asians, Africans, ALM develops on palmar, plantar, and subungual skin, and its biology is different from that of other cutaneous melanomas, where sunlight is the major known environmental determinant We present four albinos with histologic diagnoses of skin cancer Four Nigerian albinos (two men and two women) with skin cancer The sites of the lesions included the head [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in two patients and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in one patient] and the upper limb (melanoma wenty-nine patients (18 males and 11 females) with skin cancer were identified Kaposi sarcoma associated with HIV represented 81.8 percent of KS cases found. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) ranked second and malignant melanoma third Earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black Africans. In a series of melanomas from black Africans (n=26), only two BRAF mutations (8%) were found, both being different from the common T1799A substitution. Moreover, melanomas from black Africans exhibited mutations in NRAS exon 1 only (12%), whereas NRAS exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from Caucasians. Thus, the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations were particularly low in melanomas from black Africans, supporting a different pathogenesis of these tumors. Malignant melanoma (MM) remains a pediatric rarity world-wide, but perhaps more so in black Africans. To the best of our knowledge, the current report of MM in a two-and-a-half-year-old Nigerian who had a pre-existing congenital giant hairy nevus is probably the first (in an accessible literature) in a black African child. Malignant melanomas in black Africans are predominantly located on the lower extremities Thus, our findings indicate that melanomas located on the lower extremities in black Africans show several features of aggressiveness; in particular, the proliferative activity was high, and p16 alterations was frequent as evidenced by loss of protein staining. Our findings also indicated that the diagnosis is delayed among black Africans. Africans with dark skin have a reduced risk of getting all types of skin cancer as compared with Caucasians, but the ratio of their incidence rates of cutaneous malignant melanoma to that of squamous cell carcinoma is larger than the corresponding ratio for Caucasians. ( Albino Africans, as compared with normally pigmented Africans, seem to have a relatively small risk of getting cutaneous malignant melanomas compared to nonmelanomas. This is probably also true for albino and normally pigmented Caucasians. Scant data exists on melanoma in blacks from Africa The mean age at presentation of the 39 women and 24 men was 60.5 years (range of 30 to 85 years), with a peak incidence in the sixth decade. The foot was the most common site of disease (45 patients). Seven patients had subungual melanoma, seven had primary mucosal lesions, and in six, the primary lesion could not be found. The poor prognosis in black patients in South Africa is the result of delayed presentation with thick primary lesions and advanced disease The outcome of treatment in 40 black patients (27 women, 13 men; mean age 62.9 years) with plantar melanoma over a 13-year period was analysed Delay in presentation and locally advanced disease may explain the poor prognosis of plantar melanoma in black South Africans. Eighteen cases of malignant skin tumors seen at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital over 3 years (1984 to 1987) were analyzed for diagnoses, site of tumors, sex, and age. Seven patients (39%) had malignant melanomas affecting only the soles of the feet, while the same number had squamous cell carcinomas widely distributed in various parts of the body Non-white populations experienced in general a much lower incidence of melanoma although there was some overlap of white and non-white rates. Populations of African descent were found to have a higher incidence than those of Asiatic origin, but it was concluded that this was due largely to the high frequency of tumours among Africans on the sole of the foot. Pathological features of twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma studied in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during the period January, 1974 to December, 1975 are presented. Malignant melanoma accounted for 2.4% of all tumours and 4.5% of all malignant tumours, greatest age incidence being in the fifth to seventh decades. 81% melanomas occurred on the sole of feet validating the hypothesis that the pigmented skin in Africans is resistant to malignant melanoma. This paper reports the incidence of this lesion in association with invasive malignant melanomas of the feet and hands of Black Africans. Follow-up data (over a 3-year period) and the histological appearances of primary lesion were studied and related in 40 Black patients with malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma of the skin in Blacks in formidable and sinister tumour. The incidence of malignant melanoma in Johannesburg Black was 1,2 per 100 000 and accounted for 2% of all cancers. The largest number of cases occurred in the 50- 70-year age group and there was a female preponderance. As in previous studies, the sites predominantly affected were the foot and the hand, mainly on the plantar and palmar surfaces. Twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma occurring in the Igbos of Nigeria have been analysed. The site of predilection is the sole of the foot. This result supports the conclusion that Negroes tend to have the disease in the non-pigmented parts. A case of leptomeningeal melanoma in an African child of 7 years is presented together with a survey of pigmentation in the normal African brain."
Don't Conserved noncoding elements act as enhancers?,no,"The aCNEs are rich in tissue-specific enhancers Transgenic zebrafish assay of some human CNE enhancers that have been lost in teleosts Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers, In all four cases where the zebra fish and human CNE display a similar expression pattern in zebra fish, the human CNE also displays a similar expression pattern in mouse. This suggests that the endogenous enhancer activity of ∼30% of human CNEs can be determined from experiments in zebra fish If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes. Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes. Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development. We test 42 of our PCNEs in transgenic zebrafish assays--including examples from vertebrates and amphioxus--and find that the majority are functional enhancers. The genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs cluster around genes that regulate development, and where tested, they can act as transcriptional enhancers. , we identified 17 highly conserved noncoding elements, 9 of which revealed specific acetylation marks in chromatin-immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) assays performed across 250 kb of the Lmo2 locus in 11 cell types covering different stages of hematopoietic differentiation. All candidate regulatory regions were tested in transgenic mice. An extended LMO2 proximal promoter fragment displayed strong endothelial activity, while the distal promoter showed weak forebrain activity. Eight of the 15 distal candidate elements functioned as enhancers, Pan-vertebrate developmental cis-regulatory elements are discernible as highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) and are often dispersed over large areas around the pleiotropic genes whose expression they control. HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish. several transcriptional enhancers are conserved between amphioxus and vertebrates--a very wide phylogenetic distance. We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers Besides developmental regulators that are likely targets of HCNE enhancers We identify and characterize highly conserved noncoding elements flanking the TNF gene, which undergo activation-dependent intrachromosomal interactions. These elements, hypersensitive site (HSS)-9 and HSS+3 (9 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream of the TNF gene, respectively), contain DNase I hypersensitive sites in naive, T helper 1, and T helper 2 primary T cells. Both HSS-9 and HSS+3 inducibly associate with acetylated histones, indicative of chromatin remodeling, bind the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)p in vitro and in vivo, and function as enhancers We used the sequence signatures identified by this approach to successfully assign tissue-specific predictions to approximately 328,000 human-mouse conserved noncoding elements in the human genome. By overlapping these genome-wide predictions with a data set of enhancers validated in vivo, in transgenic mice, we were able to confirm our results with a 28% sensitivity and 50% precision. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development. uncovered two anciently conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) upstream of COUP-TFII (CNS-62kb and CNS-66kb). Testing these two elements using reporter constructs in liver cells (HepG2) revealed that CNS-66kb, but not CNS-62kb, yielded robust in vitro enhancer activity."
Aren't high-flow nasal cannulae effective for treatment of preterm infants?,no,"The use of high-flow nasal cannulae is an increasingly popular alternative to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for noninvasive respiratory support of very preterm infants (gestational age, <32 weeks) after extubation. The use of high-flow nasal cannulae was noninferior to the use of nasal CPAP, with treatment failure occurring in 52 of 152 infants (34.2%) in the nasal-cannulae group and in 39 of 151 infants (25.8%) in the CPAP group (risk difference, 8.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.9 to 18.7).  Although the result for the primary outcome was close to the margin of noninferiority, the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannulae was similar to that of CPAP as respiratory support for very preterm infants after extubation.  Recently high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is emerging as an efficient, better tolerated form of NIV, allowing better access to the baby's face, which may improve nursing, feeding and bonding. In conclusion, there is a growing evidence of the feasibility of HFNC as an alternative mode of NIV.  HHHFNC and NCPAP produced similar rates of extubation failure. The use of HFNC as a respiratory support modality is increasing in the infant, pediatric, and adult populations as an alternative to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Current evidence suggests that HFNC is well tolerated and may be feasible in a subset of patients who require ventilatory support with non-invasive ventilation. Heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HHHFNC) has been used to improve ventilation in preterm infants.  Increasing flow rates of HHHFNC therapy are associated with linear increases in NP pressures in bronchiolitis patients.  An alternative to the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) as a non-invasive modality to support respiratory distress in premature infants has been the recent introduction of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) devices in many neonatal units. There has been increased use of HFNC presumably because of anecdotal reports and experience that it is easy to use, and well tolerated by the infants, while experiencing decreased nasal septumerosion. High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are gaining in popularity as a form of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units around the world. HFNC may be as effective as NCPAP at improving respiratory parameters such as tidal volume and work of breathing in preterm infants, but probably only at flow rates >2 litres/min.  There is growing evidence of the feasibility of HFNC as an alternative to other forms of non-invasive ventilation in preterm infants.  When used as primary respiratory support after birth, one trial found similar rates of treatment failure in infants treated with HFNC and nasal CPAP. Following extubation, one trial found that infants treated with HFNC had a significantly higher rate of reintubation than those treated with nasal CPAP. Another trial found similar rates of reintubation for humidified and non-humidified HFNC, and the fourth trial found no difference between two different models of equipment used to deliver humidified HFNC.  When used following extubation, HFNC may be associated with a higher rate of reintubation than nasal CPAP.  Early weaning from CPAP to high flow nasal cannula in preterm infants is associated with prolonged oxygen requirement: a randomized controlled trial. After randomization, the no-NC group had fewer days on oxygen [median (interquartile range): 5 (1-8) vs 14 (7.5-19.25) days, p<0.001] and shorter duration of respiratory support [10.5 (4-21) vs 18 (11.5-29) days, p=0.03]. There were no differences between groups regarding success of weaning from NCPAP.  Weaning preterm infants from NCPAP to NC is associated with increased exposure to oxygen and longer duration of respiratory support. A number of centers use high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in the management of AOP without measuring the positive distending pressure (PDP) generated. HFNC is as effective as NCPAP in the management of AOP."
Aren't reduced-nicotine cigarettes effective for smoking cessation?,no,"CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-week study, reduced-nicotine cigarettes versus standard-nicotine cigarettes reduced nicotine exposure and dependence and the number of cigarettes smoked.  RESULTS: Significant reductions in nicotine intake were observed between usual brand smoking (∼1.2 mg nicotine) and the 0.3 and 0.05 mg nicotine emission cigarettes, but not the 0.6 mg cigarette. CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the evidence that cigarettes with markedly reduced nicotine content are not associated with increased smoking intensity or exposure to smoke toxicants. BACKGROUND: When switching from usual brand cigarettes, very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, toxicant exposure, withdrawal symptoms and dependence.  Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake. Results showed that Quest plus NRT was more effective than active control plus NRT in achieving 4 weeks of continuous abstinence (32.8% vs. 21.9%). Quest plus NRT offers promise as a new smoking cessation treatment. We identified three clinical trials (total n = 489) that suggest that smokers can dissociate nicotine delivery from the act of smoking if they use reduced-nicotine content cigarettes in combination with nicotine replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: The 0.05 mg nicotine yield cigarettes may be a tobacco product that can facilitate cessation; however, future research is clearly needed to support these preliminary findings. Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment. Reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation. Evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates. The concept for a reduced-nicotine cigarette designed to progressively wean smokers from the smoking habit is based on research demonstrating that successful smoking cessation is not only dependent on withdrawal of nicotine, but also on weaning from the habitual sensory and behavioral reinforcement of smoking. Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment Specifically, standards that required substantially reduced nicotine content in cigarettes could enable cessation in smokers and prevent future smoking among current non-smokers Reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation Evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates The concept for a reduced-nicotine cigarette designed to progressively wean smokers from the smoking habit is based on research demonstrating that successful smoking cessation is not only dependent on withdrawal of nicotine, but also on weaning from the habitual sensory and behavioral reinforcement of smoking These results suggest that use of NRT before a target quit-smoking date deserves further evaluation as a possible smoking cessation treatment. Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake. Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment."
Couldn't Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) be effective for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer?,no,"The use of HIPEC after aggressive cytoreductive surgery in patients with ovarian cancer with peritoneal dissemination can be performed with acceptable postoperative morbidity rates. Knowledge of the factors associated with the onset of these postoperative adverse events allows better management of the same and offers the patient a safe procedure These results showed that the association of HIPEC with a complete cytoreduction for recurrent ovarian cancer presents acceptable morbidity and survival There is level-one evidence suggesting the benefit of postoperative adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery, albeit catheter-related complications resulted after treatment discontinuation. Studies report the use of HIPEC predominantly in the setting of recurrent disease and have demonstrated encouraging results, which merits further investigation in future clinical trials  The combination of SCR and HIPEC seems to improve survival rate in patients suffering from platinum-sensitive EOC recurrence with respect to no-HIPEC treatments. This result further supports the need of a randomized trial  Cautious extrapolation of data from standard normothermic, nonintraoperative, intraperitoneal chemotherapy and data from Phase II and nonrandomized comparative studies suggest that HIPEC delivered at the time of surgery for ovarian cancer has definite potential The available evidence suggests that a potential survival benefit of adding HIPEC may be largest in the settings of secondary CRS for stage III ovarian cancer and salvage CRS for recurrent ovarian cancer, two time-points representing failure of initial standard therapy. There is much less evidence for a potential benefit of HIPEC for less advanced stages (I-II) and for earlier time-points in the treatment of ovarian cancer (upfront, interval and consolidation) Survival benefit of adding Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) at the different time-points of treatment of ovarian cancer Patients suffering from peritoneal recurrence of ovarian cancer should be considered for radical reoperation with HIPEC in a center with expertise in multimodal therapeutic options. Organ-preserving cytoreductive surgery allows complete cytoreduction with the goal of decreasing morbidity  In recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients, the use of CRS plus HIPEC represents a safe treatment, able to significantly influence the survival rates compared to chemotherapy alone or surgery plus standard chemotherapy  The results of our study indicate the feasibility and the potential benefit of a protocol including systemic chemotherapy, surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian cancer. A phase III trial to compare this approach with conventional treatment is needed In selected patients with heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer, cytoreduction combined with HIPEC may provide a meaningful OS with acceptable morbidity. Optimal results are achieved in patients with a macroscopically complete resection and biologically favorable disease  HIPEC is a complement to radical surgery/ peritonectomy, which has been shown to be a surgical procedure with high tolerability, low morbimortality, enhanced survival and prolonged disease-free interval in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis for recurrent ovarian cancer  Despite the heterogeneity of the studies reviewed, current evidence suggest that complete CRS and HIPEC may be a feasible option with potential benefits that are comparable with the current standard of care. A randomized trial is required to establish the role of HIPEC in ovarian cancer in the majority of patients with primary and recurrent advanced ovarian cancer, cytoreductive surgery combined with HIPEC can lead to a substantial increase in subsequent rates of disease-free and overall survival  Peritonectomy procedures combined with HIPEC offer promising long-term survival in patients with diffuse peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis. They achieve high adequate primary and secondary surgical cytoreduction rates with acceptable morbidity and mortality Cytoreduction surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer improves progression-free survival, especially in BRCA-positive patients- a case-control study. Survival benefit of adding Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) at the different time-points of treatment of ovarian cancer: review of evidence. Some encouraging results have been reported by the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from ovarian cancer by complete surgical cytoreduction, peritonectomy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Although standard treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) consists of surgical debulking and intravenous platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy, favorable oncological outcomes have been recently reported with the use of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Trabectedin, Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and chemo-immunotherapy may be become a promising therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) represents a new treatment strategy aimed to improve outcome of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Favorable oncological outcomes have been reported in several trials with the introduction of Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) in the treatment of Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC). Based on theoretical and experimental basis, HIPEC should stand as an effective treatment for ovarian cancer.

Isn't the Wnt protein modified by notum?,no,Notum deacylates Wnt proteins to suppress signalling activity. Kinetic and mass spectrometric analyses of human proteins show that Notum is a carboxylesterase that removes an essential palmitoleate moiety from Wnt proteins and thus constitutes the first known extracellular protein deacylase. the Wnt inhibitor notum the WNT-inhibitor notum.
Isn't nivolumab used for treatment of Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer?,no,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced squamous-cell non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression during or after first-line chemotherapy have limited treatment options. This randomized, open-label, international, phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, as compared with docetaxel in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced, previously treated squamous-cell NSCLC, overall survival, response rate, and progression-free survival were significantly better with nivolumab than with docetaxel, regardless of PD-L1 expression level. Agents currently in active clinical development for lung cancer include ipilimumab, which modulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 pathway, and multiple agents targeting the programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway, both anti-PD-1 compounds (nivolumab, pembrolizumab [MK-3475]) and those that target programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key ligand for PD-1 (BMS-936559, MPDL3280A). Overall Survival and Long-Term Safety of Nivolumab (Anti-Programmed Death 1 Antibody, BMS-936558, ONO-4538) in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. We report overall survival (OS), response durability, and long-term safety in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving nivolumab in this trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 129) with heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC received nivolumab 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 weeks in 8-week cycles for up to 96 weeks.  CONCLUSION: Nivolumab monotherapy produced durable responses and encouraging survival rates in patients with heavily pretreated NSCLC. Randomized clinical trials with nivolumab in advanced NSCLC are ongoing. Two PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab and Merck's MK-3475, both demonstrated positive results in phase I trials of previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer, reported at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Sydney, Australia. Recently, many trials addressed the role of such therapies for metastatic NSCLC treatment: ipilimumab, tremelimumab, nivolumab and lambrolizumab are immunotherapeutic agents of main interest in this field. Two PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb&apos;s nivolumab and Merck&apos;s MK-3475, both demonstrated positive results in phase I trials of previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer, reported at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Sydney, Australia Nivolumab, pembrolizumab (formerly known as MK-3475 and lambrolizumab), and pidilizumab are anti-PD-1 antibodies in clinical development for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers, lymphoma, and several other cancers Nivolumab versus Docetaxel in Advanced Squamous-Cell Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Activity and safety of nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, for patients with advanced, refractory squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (CheckMate 063): a phase 2, single-arm trial.  Patients with squamous non-small-cell lung cancer that is refractory to multiple treatments have poor outcomes. We assessed the activity of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, for patients with advanced, refractory, squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.  Nivolumab has clinically meaningful activity and a manageable safety profile in previously treated patients with advanced, refractory, squamous non-small cell lung cancer. These data support the assessment of nivolumab in randomised, controlled, phase 3 studies of first-line and second-line treatment."
Isn't DITPA a thyroid hormone analog utilized in experimental and clinical studies,no,"DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg · d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The identification of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) that binds to both α- and β-type TRs with relatively low affinity was unique in that this analog improves left ventricular function in heart failure as well as lowers cholesterol. Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size. Thus DITPA administration impairs baseline cardiac parameters in mice and can be fatal during in vivo acute myocardial I/R. DITPA improved some hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, but there was no evidence for symptomatic benefit in congestive heart failure The results suggested that DITPA can promote a healthy vasculature independently from its thyroid-related metabolic effects.   Moreover, DITPA and T(4) were efficacious in preventing effects of hypothyroidism on cardiac function and BVD Both T4 and DITPA had beneficial effects on chamber remodeling, which was most likely due to beneficial changes in cell shape and improved vascular supply. The thyroid analog DITPA enhances endothelial nitric oxide and beta-adrenergic-mediated vasorelaxation by increasing nitric oxide in the vasculature."
Isn't nimodipine recommended for prevention of vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,no,"This article discusses some of these unresolved issues, including the use of medications such as nimodipine, antifibrinolytics, statins, and magnesium; coiling or clipping for aneurysm securement; and the prevention and treatment of potential complications. The results of this study were as follows: nimodipine demonstrated benefit following aneurysmal SAH; other calcium channel blockers, including nicardipine, do not provide unequivocal benefit; triple-H therapy, fasudil, transluminal balloon angioplasty, thrombolytics, endothelin receptor antagonists, magnesium, statins, and miscellaneous therapies such as free radical scavengers and antifibrinolytics require additional study. The present results suggest that fasudil is equally or more effective than nimodipine for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm and subsequent ischemic injury in patients undergoing surgery for SAH. Three studies (2 meta-analyses and 1 randomized controlled trial) demonstrated that nimodipine use confers benefits (reduced morbidity and mortality) for patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nimodipine is the only preventative treatment that can be recommended. Nimodipine (Nimotop), HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor (statins) and enoxaparin (Lovenox) were the only drugs with level-1 evidence available for the treatment of vasospasm from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as defined by the US Preventative Services Task Force. The calcium antagonist nimodipine has been shown to reduce the incidence of ischemic complications following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There was no significant difference in the incidence of DINDs (28 vs 30% in the peroral and intravenous groups, respectively) or middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (> 120 cm/second, 50 vs 45%, respectively). Clinical outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale was the same in both groups, and there was no difference in the number of patients with new infarctions on MR imaging. The results suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy between peroral and intravenous administration of nimodipine in preventing DINDs or cerebral vasospasm following SAH. the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia is reduced with nimodipine and avoiding hypovolemia A recommendations (standard) for the prophylaxis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm with oral Nimodipine in good grade patients. Of the 75 patients initially considered for active treatment, 83% underwent surgery within 48 hours of rupture, all received nimodipine, 16% received tissue plasminogen activator to lyse subarachnoid or intraventricular clots, 40% underwent hypertensive treatment, and 7% underwent transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm. All patients with aneurysmal SAH should be treated with the calcium antagonist nimodipine, and in certain circumstances patients should receive anticonvulsants. The following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms; the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists, hypervolaemic haemodilution, and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature. Seven placebo-controlled clinical studies have shown that nimodipine improves the outcome of patients with severe neurological damage due to cerebral vasospasm. In a series of 100 individuals with a ruptured supratentorial aneurysm, who were subjected to aneurysm operation in the acute stage and who subsequently received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, the occurrence of DID with FND was reduced to 5%. There are many possible successful treatment options for preventing vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, and poor neurologic outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, further multicenter RCTs need to be performed to determine if there is a significant benefit from their use. Nimodipine is the only treatment that provided a significant benefit across multiple studies. Absence of symptomatic vasospasm, occurrence of low density areas associated with vasospasm on CT, and occurrence of adverse events were similar between the two groups. The clinical outcomes were more favorable in the fasudil group than in the nimodipine group (p = 0.040). The proportion of patients with good clinical outcome was 74.5% (41/55) in the fasudil group and 61.7% (37/60) in the nimodipine group. Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus, poor outcome and occasionally death, after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Advances in diagnosis and treatment, principally nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations, and endovascular neuroradiology procedures, have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing. Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus to poor outcome and occasionally death. Advances in diagnosis and treatment-principally the use of nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations and endovascular neuroradiology procedures-have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing. Cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia remain common complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and yet therapies for cerebral vasospasm are limited. Despite a large number of clinical trials, only calcium antagonists have strong evidence supporting their effectiveness. The only proven therapy for vasospasm is nimodipine. nimodipine is indicated after SAH and tirilazad is not effective. Fasudil hydrochloride and nimodipine both showed inhibitory effects on cerebral vasospasm. The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm was five of 33 patients in the fasudil group and nine of 32 patients in the nimodipine group. Good recovery evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale was achieved by 23 of 33 patients in the fasudil group and 19 of 34 patients in the nimodipine group. Both drugs significantly improved consciousness levels and neurological deficits such as aphasia. However, fasudil hydrochloride improved motor disturbance more than nimodipine."
Is there any data to suggest that TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) administration can improve symptom severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients?,yes,"These central nervous system (CNS)-mediated effects provide the rationale for use of TRH and its analogs in the treatment of brain and spinal injury, and CNS disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, depression, shock and ischemia. The Effect of TRH to correct the abnormal F responses in SSP might be consistent with effects of TRH to reduce spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis described previously Agents undergoing therapeutic trials at present include CNTF, IGF1 glutamate antagonists, branched-chain amino acids and TRH analogue. Evidence that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has prominent trophic effects on the motor system led to several negative therapeutic trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease of the motor system. The results of the clinical evaluation at the beginning and end of the treatment as well as after patient follow up demonstrated that beneficial effects do not occur equally in all patients but rather are transitory and do not improve the natural evolution of the disease. The neurological evaluation after acute TRH-T treatment showed an objective improvement in 3 of the 8. The outcome of the study, in agreement with some and at variance with other studies, was that TRH induced a statistically significant neurological improvement in 17 of the 23 ALS patients but little or none in the other ALS patients and in patients with other neurological diseases. [A case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disturbance of vertical ocular movement responding to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH)]. TRH injections resulted in improvement of disturbance of vertical ocular movement, but no effect was seen on the weakness of the limb. 13 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were treated with intravenous infusion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).  Similar improvements in speech, swallowing and in tongue and jaw movements were seen after iv and oral administration in nine, five and eight patients respectively.  No clinical improvement was detected.  A trial of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH) 5.0 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously every other day for two weeks produced transient increased tone in muscles, along with other (side-) effects in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Although the mechanism is not known, several reports of the effectiveness of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) in ALS were recently published. Protirelin (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) appears to be a neuromodulator in the extrahypothalamic nervous system and has been suggested as an adjunct in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Clinical studies have shown that response to TRH is state dependent, that is, it depends on whether the patient has bulbar or nonbulbar signs and is male or female. Future studies must take into consideration this state dependence as a specific feature of the pharmacological action of TRH and its analogues. Three of the studies showed a transient, statistically significant effect in at least some muscles. The two studies that demonstrated no such effect both used TRH in very small doses. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the effect of TRH in ALS is a definite, acute, and transient response.  It was found that in only 3 out of 14 patients with moderately progressed disease no improvement was achieved, while in 11 cases the improvement was from 10 to 20%. However, the improvement was transient, and TRH treatment failed to stop the progression of the disease. Only 3 patients noted subjective improvement of strength. In 6 of the 9, TRH induced a significant increase in vibratory inhibition. This suggests that the TRH-induced reduction of spasticity might be due to an increase in presynaptic inhibition acting on Ia fibres. However, 2 mg DN-1417, IM twice a day for 1 month in an open-label trial, produced no objective improvement of strength in nine patients with ALS.  Our experience suggests that this approach is safe, has high patient acceptance, and is worthy of more careful evaluation. Focal, small-to-moderate and transient improvement occurred in the muscle strength and function of patients with ALS who received TRH in dose-response and screening studies. In a small pilot study of 12 patients, 3 months administration of TRH at 10 mg per kg on alternate days resulted in localized increased strength of jaw muscles as well as significant improvement in lower extremity function. Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in patients with ALS following administration of TRH.  Mild to moderate improvement was found in 9 (56%) of 16 patients.  We thought such action of TRH to be useful to the therapy of ALS. With daily TRH, 10 patients noted subjective improvement without objective evidence, and 10 patients complained of worsening of the disease with objective decline after TRH was stopped. Statistical analysis, however, showed no beneficial effects from either acute or chronic TRH trials. A temporary increase in the strength of some muscles was detected following the administration of TRH, but no change in functional performance was noted. Neither the patients nor the investigators believed the effects were of any marked clinical significance. Nevertheless, statistically significant improvement was seen only in dynametric strength 1 hour after subcutaneous injection (p less than 0.05). Significant improvement occurred, in one patient only, on subjective speech testing during IV infusion of TRH. In none of six other ratings was there a significant difference between TRH and placebo. Subjective improvement was noted by 11 of 12 patients. Significant improvement, as shown by statistical analysis, was noted in muscle strength in the 9 patients by 5 infusions over a 4-week period and a sub-group of 5 patients treated by 8 infusions over 10 weeks. The progressive course of this disease, manifested by increasing atrophy, paralysis and disability score, was not altered.  Very high intravenous doses (2-19 mg/min) of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide) given to 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) produced a moderate to marked improvement of functions caused by deficiency of lower motor neurons (weakness) and upper motor neurons (spasticity). The improvement was sustained throughout the infusion and for about 1 h thereafter; sometimes a slight improvement was evident 20 h after infusion. Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in patients with ALS following administration of TRH"
Is celiac disease caused by gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events ?,yes,"Celiac disease (CD) is a frequent inflammatory intestinal disease, with a genetic background, caused by gliadin-containing food.  Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy initiated and sustained by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. It is caused by a dysregulated immune response toward both dietary antigens, the gluten proteins of wheat, rye, and barley, and autoantigens, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2) Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the presence of anti-transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and anti-gliadin antibodies Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) catalyzes cross-linking or deamidation of glutamine residues in peptides and proteins. The in vivo deamidation of gliadin peptides plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides recognized by intestinal T cells from patients."
Can venlafaxine block NET and SERT?,yes,"Treatment for 14 days with 70 mg/kg per day venlafaxine, which inhibits both the NET and SERT, or 10 mg/kg per day phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, produced antidepressant-like effects on behavior without altering NET or SERT expression. Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT. Chronic venlafaxine treatment affected SERT and NET binding differently from paroxetine or desipramine. Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT Paroxetine and venlafaxine are potent serotonin transporter (SERT) antagonists and weaker norepinephrine transporter (NET) antagonists Using a novel blood assay that estimates CNS transporter occupancy we estimated the relative SERT and NET occupancy of paroxetine and venlafaxine in human subjects to assess the relative magnitude of SERT and NET inhibition Treatment for 14 days with 70 mg/kg per day venlafaxine, which inhibits both the NET and SERT, or 10 mg/kg per day phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, produced antidepressant-like effects on behavior without altering NET or SERT expression We then performed the first reported investigation of epistasis between the SERT gene and norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2, alias NET) in AN, as an earlier study suggested that atypical AN responds to the dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine Of particular interest were the findings that paroxetine, generally thought of as a selective SERT antagonist, possesses moderately high affinity for the NET and that venlafaxine, which has been described as a &quot;dual uptake inhibitor&quot;, possesses weak affinity for the NET The ratios of measured occupancy ED(50) values (doses at which 50% occupancy occurs) among SERT, NET and DAT sites for duloxetine, venlafaxine, nomifensine, indatraline, DOV 21,947 and DOV 216,303 were consistent with the ratios of the in vitro affinities between these target binding sites SERT and NET occupancy by venlafaxine and milnacipran in nonhuman primates: a PET study In this study in nonhuman primates, we aimed to investigate the relationship between SERT and NET affinity by measuring the in vivo occupancy at both transporters of venlafaxine and milnacipran We hypothesized that venlafaxine would affect monoamine transporters dose-dependently, with low doses causing selective reduction of SERT binding sites and higher doses reducing both SERT and NET binding sites Comparative studies with clinically used antidepressants showed that venlafaxine possessed a profile similar to S33005 but was less potent. Clomipramine likewise interacted with SERTs and NETs but also with several other receptors types, while citalopram and reboxetine were preferential ligands of SERTs and NETs, respectively. In conclusion, S33005 interacts potently with SERTs and, less markedly, with NETs.  Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT. Serotonergic effects occur with lower doses, whereas both serotonergic and noradrenergic effects occur with higher doses of venlafaxine. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that the low dose of venlafaxine blocked selectively the reuptake of 5-HT, whereas the high dose blocked the reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. Moreover, an enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission by venlafaxine was only achieved under conditions whereby the desensitization of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptor is appended to that of the somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptor."
Aren't adenylyl cyclases always transmembrane proteins?,yes,"ransmembrane adenylyl cyclase  Transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) and soluble AC (sAC)  Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is a recently recognized source of the signaling molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP) that is genetically and biochemically distinct from the classic G-protein-regulated transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs). Soluble adenylyl cyclase  transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs), and soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC).   Here, we showed that both transmembrane AC (tmAC) and soluble AC (sAC) are distinctly involved in the regulation of sperm motility in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis.  cAMP production in beta cells is mediated not simply by transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (TMACs), but also by sAC. In contrast to tmAC, sAC produces cAMP in various intracellular microdomains close to specific cAMP targets, e.g., in nucleus and mitochondria soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC, ADCY10), the ubiquitous, non-transmembrane adenylyl cyclase, was found to play a key role in neuronal survival and axon growth. Central role of soluble adenylyl cyclase"
Does TUC.338 inhibit colorectal cancer?,no,"TUC.338 promotes invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer. Until now, the role of TUC.338 in colorectal cancers remains undefined. This study revealed that TUC.338 is significantly up-regulated in colorectal cancers (CRC) tissue and CRC cell lines, and the up-regulated TUC.338 is associated with lymph node metastasis.  Thus, these findings suggested that TUC.338 acts as a novel oncogene by targeting the TIMP-1 gene thus promoting colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion.

Aren't there any animal models for Niemann-Pick C1 disease?,no,"Several animal models were used to analyze the impaired pathways.  We investigated components of the surfactant system in both NPC1 mutant mice and felines and in NPC2 mutant mice near the end of their expected life span.  Thus far, studies of NPC mice have been performed mainly to study the brain and neurodegeneration, because degeneration in the brain was known as the primary cause of death in NPC mice.  the NPC1(-/-) mouse is available serving as an appropriate animal model of the human disease, o examine the onset and progression of neuropathological insults in NPC we have systematically examined the CNS of a mouse model of NPC1 (Npc1(-/-) mice) at different stages of the disease course.

Couldn't divalent metal transporter 1 deficiency lead to anemia?,no,"The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a major iron transporter required for iron absorption and erythropoiesis. Loss of DMT1 function results in microcytic anemia.  Dysfunction of human DMT1 is associated with several pathologies such as iron deficiency anemia hemochromatosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as colorectal cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma, making DMT1 an attractive target for drug discovery. Deficiency of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) leads to hypochromic microcytic anemia. We have previously shown that DMT1 deficiency impairs erythroid differentiation and induces apoptosis of erythroid cells.  We propose that DMT1 deficiency negatively affects metabolism and life span of mature erythrocytes; two other aspects of defective erythropoiesis which contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Hypochromic microcytic anemia associated with ineffective erythropoiesis caused by recessive mutations in divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) can be improved with high-dose erythropoietin supplementation.  Belgrade rats exhibit microcytic, hypochromic anemia and systemic iron deficiency due to a glycine-to-arginine mutation at residue 185 in a metal ion transporter of a divalent metal transporter/divalent cation transporter/solute carrier 11 group A member 2 or 3 (DMT1/DCT1/SLC11A2), a member of the natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) family.

The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a major iron transporter required for iron absorption and erythropoiesis. This mutation severely impairs the iron transport capability of DMT1, leading to systemic iron deficiency and anemia."
Is metabolic syndrome related with cardiovascular disease?,yes,"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a cluster of risk factors including central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, The MetS is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  As a molecular link between metabolic signals, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction, resistin can be proposed as playing a significant role in the heightened inflammatory state induced by metabolic stress linked to excessive caloric intake, thus contributing to the risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with a higher risk for both, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.  arotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) has been widely used as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD)"
Can PLN mutations lead to dilated cardiomyopathy?,yes,"A PLN founder mutation (43 cases) and LMNA mutations (19 cases, 16 different mutations) were most prevalent and often demonstrated a specific phenotype. PLN mutation R14del was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients The PLN R14del founder mutation is present in a substantial number of patients clinically diagnosed with DCM or ARVC Arg(9) → Cys (R9C) and Arg(14) deletion (R14del) mutations in PLN are associated with lethal dilated cardiomyopathy in humans We previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients. Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; Mutations in the PLN gene are a rare cause of heart failure, present almost exclusively in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy etiology A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death. Complete genetic and clinical analyses were performed in a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy due to the PLN-R14Del mutation. A candidate gene approach resulted in identification of a heterozygous deletion of arginine 14 in the gene encoding phospholamban (PLN-R14Del) segregating with dilated cardiomyopathy in the family pedigree. Mutation carriers suffered from familial dilated cardiomyopathy associated with cardiac death between the ages of 26 and 50 years. a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy due to the PLN-R14Del mutation. For the phospholamban (PLN) and titin cap (TTN) genes, a direct mutation screening approach was used. DNA sequence analysis of all exons showed no evidence that these genes are involved in DCM in the Newfoundland dog. two human PLN mutations, associated with either absence or sustained dephosphorylation of PLN, were linked to dilated cardiomyopathy. Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by early onset and the presence of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. The identical PLN mutation can be associated with both mild and severe forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, PLN mutations should be considered in late onset cardiomyopathy Through genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identified a previously uncharacterized deletion of arginine 14 (PLN-R14Del) in the coding region of the phospholamban (PLN) gene in a large family with hereditary heart failure. No PLN gene mutation was found in patients with DCM in Chengdu. This result indicated that PLN gene mutation may not be a common cause for DCM in the Chinese population in Chengdu. none in PLN the recent discoveries of human PLN mutations leading to disease states. Strikingly, both individuals homozygous for L39stop developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27. humans lacking PLN develop lethal dilated cardiomyopathy. Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN)"
Have thyronamines  effects on fat tissue?,no,"In conclusion, trace amines and thyronamines are negative inotropic agents. Their in vivo administration induces effects opposite to those induced by thyroid hormone, including lowering of body temperature."
Isn't vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,no,"Vortioxetine is the most recently approved medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).  [Vortioxetine: a new antidepressant to treat depressive episodes]. Vortioxetine is a new antidepressant, which mechanism of action is multimodal, targeting the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT3, 5-HT7 receptors and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT).  In short-term studies (8 weeks), vortioxetine is more efficacious than placebo in decreasing depressive symptoms as measured by the MADRS total score, response rate (vortioxetine: 53.2% vs placebo: 35.2%) and remission rate (vortioxetine: 29.2% vs placebo: 19.3%). In a long-term study (52 weeks), vortioxetine is also superior to placebo in preventing relapses and recurrences. Moreover, in second line treatment, after failure of a first line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), vortioxetine is superior to agomelatine in improving depressive symptoms and achieving response and remission.  Against this background, we feature the novel antidepressants vortioxetine, vilazodone and milnacipran/levomilnacipran with regard to their serotonin receptor targets such as the 5-HT1A, 5-HT3 and 5-HT7 which may account for their specific effects on certain symptoms of depression (e.g. cognition and anxiety) as well as a characteristic side-effect profile. CONCLUSION: Vortioxetine dominated venlafaxine XR in South Korea and is a relevant treatment option for MDD patients initiating or switching therapy. Vortioxetine: a New Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. INTRODUCTION: Vortioxetine is a structurally novel medication that has recently been approved for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). EXPERT OPINION: Results of placebo-controlled trials suggest efficacy and an overall safety profile comparable to existing first-line antidepressants.  The authors suggest that vortioxetine is currently a good second-line antidepressant option and shows promise, pending additional long-term data, to become a first-line antidepressant option. Clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than was placebo, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.118 (95% CIs, -0.203 to -0.033, P = 0.007). Vortioxetine for the treatment of depression. Vortioxetine for the treatment of major depression. Vortioxetine (Lu-AA-21004; 1-[2-(2,4-dimethylphenylsulfanyl)phenyl]piperazine hydrobromide) is a novel orally active molecule that is being investigated by Lundbeck and Takeda for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorders. Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a multi-modal antidepressant in clinical development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). A randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine 2.5 and 10 mg in acute treatment of adults with generalized anxiety disorder. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. Secondary endpoints included response and remission rates, anxiety symptoms(Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), Clinical Global Impression, overall functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale), health-related quality of life(EuroQol 5 Dimensions), productivity (work limitation questionnaire) and family functioning (Depression and Family Functioning Scale).RESULTS: Primary endpoint noninferiority was established and vortioxetine (n = 252) was superior to agomelatine (n = 241) by 2.2 MADRS points (p<0.01). Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is an antidepressant with a mechanism of action thought to be related to a combination of 2 pharmacologic actions: direct modulation of several receptors and inhibition of the serotonin transporter.To evaluate the efficacy of vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg once daily in outpatients with major depressive disorder.This 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted from July 2010 to January 2012 among adults with a primary diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder (DSM-IV-TR).Eligible subjects were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms: vortioxetine 10 mg, vortioxetine 20 mg, or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a new antidepressant that combines a number of neurotransmitter reuptake and receptor effects that have been thought to predict efficacy as a treatment for depressive and anxiety disorders.This review summarizes the pharmacology and neurobiology of vortioxetine In the study of elderly patients, vortioxetine 5 mg (n = 136) improved 12-item Health Status Questionnaire scores significantly more than placebo (n = 148) for the domains of health perception (10.4, P &lt; 0.0001, SES of 0.54), mental health (7.9, P &lt; 0.001, SES of 0.44), and energy (6.4, P &lt; 0.05, SES of 0.28) (FAS, mixed model for repeated measures).Vortioxetine yielded significant, meaningful HRQoL improvements in 6 MDD studies of 6 to 8 weeks duration. All references included were published between 1999 and 2014.All studies that included humans and were published in English, with data describing vortioxetine for the treatment of MDD, were reviewed.Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal antidepressant agent, which inhibits the 5-HT transporter protein, acts as a 5-HT3 antagonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day Vortioxetine is an antidepressant with multimodal activity which has shown efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in six of ten short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (completed end 2012).We performed meta-regression analyses to indirectly compare vortioxetine to seven marketed antidepressants with different mechanisms of action Data were available from 51 human trials involving vortioxetine, and included a total of 7,666 healthy volunteers and patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder who were exposed to at least 1 dose of vortioxetine for a total of 2,743 patient-years.Vortioxetine was effective in treating MDD in the United States at a dose of 20 mg/d Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.Subjects (n = 457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10 mg once daily There was a significant difference for nausea between the two groups (OR=3.01, 95 % CI=2.22-4.09, Z=7.08, P=0.00001), but no significant differences were observed for the other four adverse effects.CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of major depressive disorder, our results show that a dose of 5 mg/day vortioxetine was more effective, but more easily induced nausea, compared to placebo.

Vortioxetine in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind controlled trials. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day.  Clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was significantly higher in the duloxetine group than in the vortioxetine group.Duloxetine was more effective but less well-tolerated than vortioxetine in MDD. There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates between vortioxetine and comparators owing to inefficacy (OR 0.983, 95% CI 0.585 to 1.650), whereas discontinuation owing to AEs was significantly less common in the vortioxetine than in the comparator group (OR 0.728, 95% CI 0.554 to 0.957).Studies examining the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD are limited.Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a l We performed a meta-analysis to increase the statistical power of these studies and enhance our current understanding of the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD.We performed an extensive search of databases and the clinical trial registry. BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.METHODS: Subjects (n = 457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10 mg once daily. Vortioxetine significantly improved objective and subjective measures of cognitive function in adults with recurrent MDD and these effects were largely independent of its effect on improving depressive symptoms. Furthermore, a statistically significant number of patients with MDD who were on vortioxetine have achieved a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in depression symptoms from baseline. BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal compound that has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a limited number of heterogeneous RCTs.. Vortioxetine is an effective agent for the treatment of MDD, but it does not have any clear advantages over other available treatment options.. Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than placebo for acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Duloxetine was more effective but less well-tolerated than vortioxetine in MDD."
Is intraoperative radiotherapy used for treatment of glioblastoma?,no,"1) Intraoperative radiotherapy ( IOR , 1,000-2,000 rad) was applied in 13 cases; the 2-year survival was 41.6%.  The median survival time after IORT was 12 months for 9 patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, while it was 51 months for 8 patients with less infiltrative tumors (ependymoma, anaplastic ependymoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma).  It is concluded that IORT combined with extensive tumor removal has an acceptable toxicity in previously irradiated patients and can be effective for selected recurrent malignant brain tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that IORT can contribute to successful tumor treatment while neither increasing peri-operative morbidity nor subacute sequelae. This review compiles preclinical and clinical evidence for a dedicated treatment of both residual cancer cells and regional microenvironment using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT).  Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a pragmatic and effective approach to sterilize the margins from persistent tumor cells, abrogate post-injury proliferative stimuli and to bridge the therapeutic gap between surgery and radiochemotherapy.

Is Mycobacterium avium less susceptible to antibiotics than Mycobacterium tuberculosis?,yes,"The prevalence of MAC lung infection in two inner city hospitals was four times higher than that of TB. Most patients with combined infection were clinically consistent with MTB and responded to anti MTB treatment alone. The triplex PCR developed by us could be used to detect and differentiate M. tuberculosis, M. avium and other mycobacteria in a single reaction tube. Twelve (15%) of the 80 blood cultures were positive for mycobacteria, with Mycobacterium avium being identified in 7 (8.8%) samples and M. tuberculosis in 5 (6.2%).  The antimycobacterial activities of RS-112997, RS-124922 and RS-118641, three capuramycin analogues that inhibit phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase, were tested against clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare The MIC50/90 (mg/L) results for RS-118641 were: M. tuberculosis, 1/2; multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis, 0.5/2; M. avium, 4/8; and M. intracellulare, 0.06/0.5 These results suggest that capuramycin analogues exhibit strong antimycobacterial potential and should be considered for further evaluation in the treatment of M. tuberculosis and M. avium-M. intracellulare complex infections in humans. Mycobacterium avium causes disseminated infection in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Overall incidences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were 0.8 and 1.4 cases/100 person-years of follow-up (PYF), decreasing from 1.8 (TB) and 3.5 cases/100 PYF (MAC) before September 1995 to 0.3 and 0.2 cases/100 PYF after March 1997. Because M tuberculosis disease is preventable and curable and yet communicable, physicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion for tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults. In comparison, the goal of treating M avium complex in patients with advanced HIV disease is to reduce constitutional symptoms and improve survival. MAC pulmonary disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of SPNs, even when encountered in geographic regions with a high prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis. From April 2001 to February 2002, 80 blood samples from patients who were suspected to have disseminated mycobacterial infection, presenting fever and (preferably) a CD4 T cell count<100.0 cell/mL were investigated IL-10 underlies distinct susceptibility of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice to Mycobacterium avium infection and influences efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Clinical utility of rifabutin 1 (RBT), a potent antibiotic used in multidrug regimens for tuberculosis (TB) as well as for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), has been hampered due to dose-limiting toxicity.  Effective therapeutic regimens exist that are limited by the emergence of drug resistance and the inability of antibiotics to kill dormant organisms.  Clinical utility of rifabutin 1 (RBT), a potent antibiotic used in multidrug regimens for tuberculosis (TB) as well as for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), has been hampered due to dose-limiting toxicity. a potent antibiotic used in multidrug regimens for tuberculosis (TB) as well as for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Clinical utility of rifabutin 1 (RBT), a potent antibiotic used in multidrug regimens for tuberculosis (TB) as well as for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), has been hampered due to dose-limiting toxicity. tuberculosis appear to have different genetic mechanisms for resisting the effects of these antibiotics, with pks12 playing a relatively more significant role in MAC."
Doesn't triiodothyronine play a regulatory role in insulin secretion from pancreas?,no,"Our findings establish that p43 is an important regulator of glucose homeostasis and pancreatic β-cell function and provide evidence for the first time of a physiological role for a mitochondrial endocrine receptor. The p43(-/-) mice had a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of rat pancreatic islets with T3 results in augmented β-cell vitality with an increase of their functional properties. Nonetheless, the insulin secretion is sensibly augmented after T3 stimulation. Plasma glucose concentration of the fetal hypothyroid group during intravenous glucose tolerance test was significantly higher (p=0.003) at 5-20 min as compared to the control group, whereas plasma insulin concentration was significantly lower (p=0.012) at 5-20 min Although adult offspring born from hypothyroid mothers were euthyroid, their glucose tolerance and glucose stimulated insulin secretion of islets were altered hyroid hormones modulate the immune system and metabolism, influence insulin secretion Only T(3) concentrations higher than 250 microM were able to decrease cell viability and proliferation rate, to increase the rate of apoptosis and to reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion. Islets preincubated with glucose (3.3 mmol/l) and glucagon (1.4 mumol/l) plus theophylline (10 mmol/l), ACTH (0.11 nmol/l), bovine GH (0.46 mumol/l), prolactin (0.2 mumol/l) or tri-iodothyronine (1.0 nmol/l) have significantly lower Ca(2+)-ATPase activity than those preincubated with only 3.3 mmol glucose/l. All these hormones increased the release of insulin significantly. T3 (0.2 nM) did not affect insulin secretion in the absence or presence of glucose or in the presence of secretagogues (potassium and glyceraldehyde). In the perfused rat pancreas, the addition of thyroxine (10 micrograms/dL) or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (150 ng/dL) to the perfusing medium did not affect insulin secretion. The administration of thyroxine (40 micrograms/kg, s.c.) in vivo increased the plasma insulin level from 11 +/- 2 microUnits/mL (mean +/- SD) to 30 +/- 7 microUnits/mL Addition of T3 to the incubation medium, significantly modified the insulin release, but its effect varied according to the glucose concentration in the medium, i.e. it enhanced the insulin release at a glucose concentration between 2 to 8 mmol/l; it has no effect at 12 mmol/glucose, and significantly inhibited the secretion of insulin in the presence of 16.6 mmol/l glucose. Both T3 and T4 inhibited insulin secretion"
Doesn't DDX54 play a role in DNA damage response?,no,"DDX54 regulates transcriptome dynamics during DNA damage response. The contribution of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks to the DNA damage response (DDR) has not been extensively studied. Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)+RNA in IR-exposed cells. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts. Because DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR, its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies. Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs."
Can RNASeq be used for the analysis of nascent transcripts?,yes,"Here, we utilize nascent RNA sequencing to document dosage compensation during transcriptional elongation. Here we show that RNA-seq can also be used for studying nascent RNAs undergoing transcription Conversely, the nuclear fraction shows an enrichment of unprocessed RNA compared with total RNA-seq, making it suitable for analysis of nascent transcripts and RNA processing dynamics."
Is Weaver syndrome similar to Sotos?,yes,"Overgrowth conditions are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by increased growth and variable features, including macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and various degrees of learning difficulties and intellectual disability. Among them, Sotos and Weaver syndromes are clinically well defined and due to heterozygous mutations in NSD1 and EZH2, respectively. NSD1 and EZH2 are both histone-modifying enzymes NSD1 and EZH2 are SET domain-containing histone methyltransferases that play key roles in the regulation of transcription through histone modification and chromatin modeling: NSD1 preferentially methylates lysine residue 36 of histone 3 (H3K36) and is primarily associated with active transcription, while EZH2 shows specificity for lysine residue 27 (H3K27) and is associated with transcriptional repression Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap Clinically, Weaver syndrome is closely related to Sotos syndrome, which is frequently caused by mutations in NSD1 Overgrowth syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Weaver syndrome have an increased risk of neoplasia. Thus, it is not surprising that prenatal overgrowth occurs in several syndromes, including the Sotos and Weaver syndromes. NSD1 mutations are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and occur in some cases of Weaver syndrome but are rare in other overgrowth phenotypes. We conclude therefore that NSD1 mutations account for most cases of Sotos syndrome and a significant number of Weaver syndrome cases in our series. We conclude that intragenic mutations of NSD1 are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and account for some Weaver syndrome cases but rarely occur in other childhood overgrowth phenotypes. Overgrowth syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Weaver syndrome have an increased risk of neoplasia NSD1 mutations are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and occur in some cases of Weaver syndrome but are rare in other overgrowth phenotypes We conclude that intragenic mutations of NSD1 are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and account for some Weaver syndrome cases but rarely occur in other childhood overgrowth phenotypes Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident.  Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident. The identification of an EZH2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and Sotos syndromes.  Overgrowth syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Weaver syndrome have an increased risk of neoplasia. Two previous cases of neuroblastoma have been reported in children with Weaver syndrome. Weaver syndrome is closely related to Sotos syndrome, Overgrowth syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and Weaver syndrome have an increased risk of neoplasia. Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident. Clinically, Weaver syndrome is closely related to Sotos syndrome, which is frequently caused by mutations in NSD1."
Does GC content vary markedly within a given isochore?,no,"The isochore, a large DNA sequence with relatively small GC variance, is one of the most important structures in eukaryotic genomes. Isochores are large regions of relatively homogeneous nucleotide composition Vertebrate genomes are comprised of isochores that are relatively long (>100 kb) regions with a relatively homogenous (either GC-rich or AT-rich) base composition and with rather sharp boundaries with neighboring isochores. The human genome is composed of large sequence segments with fairly homogeneous GC content, namely isochores Isochores, i.e. stretches of DNA with a distinct sequence composition and thus a specific GC content The human genome is composed of long stretches of DNA with distinct GC contents, called isochores or GC-content domains. The human genome is divided into isochores, large stretches (>>300 kb) of genomic DNA with more or less consistent GC content.  Many eukaryotic genomes contain isochore regions, mosaics of homogeneous GC content that can abruptly change from one neighboring isochore to the next. One of the most striking features of mammalian and birds chromosomes is the variation in the guanine-cytosine (GC) content that occurs over scales of hundreds of kilobases to megabases; this is known as the ""isochore"" structure. The segmentation analysis shows that there are stronger indications of GC content changes at isochore borders than within an isochore. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them. An isochore sequence may pass a homogeneity test when GC content fluctuations at smaller length scales are ignored or averaged out. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them"
Isn't microRNA(miRNA) 30 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,no,"The myocardium of the failing heart undergoes a number of structural alterations, most notably hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes and an increase in extracellular matrix proteins, often seen as primary fibrosi Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a key molecule in the process of fibrosis and therefore seems an attractive therapeutic target CTGF is importantly regulated by 2 major cardiac microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-133 and miR-30. the expression of both miRNAs was inversely related to the amount of CTGF in 2 rodent models of heart disease and in human pathological left ventricular hypertrophy. Second, in cultured cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, knockdown of these miRNAs increased CTGF levels. Third, overexpression of miR-133 or miR-30c decreased CTGF levels, which was accompanied by decreased production of collagens. miR-30 importantly limit the production of CTGF miR-30 directly downregulate CTGF, a key profibrotic protein, and thereby establish an important role for these miRNAs in the control of structural changes in the extracellular matrix of the myocardium."
Is nivolumab used for treatment of Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer?,yes,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced squamous-cell non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression during or after first-line chemotherapy have limited treatment options. This randomized, open-label, international, phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, as compared with docetaxel in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced, previously treated squamous-cell NSCLC, overall survival, response rate, and progression-free survival were significantly better with nivolumab than with docetaxel, regardless of PD-L1 expression level. Agents currently in active clinical development for lung cancer include ipilimumab, which modulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 pathway, and multiple agents targeting the programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway, both anti-PD-1 compounds (nivolumab, pembrolizumab [MK-3475]) and those that target programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key ligand for PD-1 (BMS-936559, MPDL3280A). Overall Survival and Long-Term Safety of Nivolumab (Anti-Programmed Death 1 Antibody, BMS-936558, ONO-4538) in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. We report overall survival (OS), response durability, and long-term safety in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving nivolumab in this trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 129) with heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC received nivolumab 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 weeks in 8-week cycles for up to 96 weeks.  CONCLUSION: Nivolumab monotherapy produced durable responses and encouraging survival rates in patients with heavily pretreated NSCLC. Randomized clinical trials with nivolumab in advanced NSCLC are ongoing. Two PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab and Merck's MK-3475, both demonstrated positive results in phase I trials of previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer, reported at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Sydney, Australia. Recently, many trials addressed the role of such therapies for metastatic NSCLC treatment: ipilimumab, tremelimumab, nivolumab and lambrolizumab are immunotherapeutic agents of main interest in this field. Two PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb&apos;s nivolumab and Merck&apos;s MK-3475, both demonstrated positive results in phase I trials of previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer, reported at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Sydney, Australia Nivolumab, pembrolizumab (formerly known as MK-3475 and lambrolizumab), and pidilizumab are anti-PD-1 antibodies in clinical development for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers, lymphoma, and several other cancers Nivolumab versus Docetaxel in Advanced Squamous-Cell Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Activity and safety of nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, for patients with advanced, refractory squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (CheckMate 063): a phase 2, single-arm trial.  Patients with squamous non-small-cell lung cancer that is refractory to multiple treatments have poor outcomes. We assessed the activity of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, for patients with advanced, refractory, squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.  Nivolumab has clinically meaningful activity and a manageable safety profile in previously treated patients with advanced, refractory, squamous non-small cell lung cancer. These data support the assessment of nivolumab in randomised, controlled, phase 3 studies of first-line and second-line treatment."
Is Doxorubicin cardiotoxic?,yes,"Doxorubicin (DOXO) is widely used to treat solid tumors. However, its clinical use is limited by side effects including serious cardiotoxicity due to cardiomyocyte damage.  The results provide direct evidence for the role of catalase in doxorubicin cardiotoxic responses. These results do not support the possibility that mitomycin C potentiates the acute cardiotoxic effects produced by doxorubicin. The anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin is converted by the enzyme carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) into its cardiotoxic metabolite doxorubicinol The clinical efficiency of the highly potent antitumor agent doxorubicin is limited by cardiotoxic effects Doxorubicin (DOX), a highly active chemotherapeutic drug, faces limitations in clinical application due to severe cardiotoxic effects (mainly through increased oxidative stress) Clinical uses of doxorubicin (DOX), a highly active anticancer agent, are limited by its severe cardiotoxic side effects associated with increased oxidative stress and apoptosis Doxorubicin (DOX) and trastuzumab (TRZ) are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents in the breast cancer setting, limited by their cardiotoxic side effects Twisting and ironing: doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by mitochondrial DNA damage. Cardiotoxic effects were reported in 15 (5%) of 291 children receiving treatment including doxorubicin. On the other hand, pretreatment of rats with hesperidin protected cardiac tissues against the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin as evidenced from amelioration of histopathological changes and normalization of cardiac biochemical parameters.Hesperidin may have a protective effect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. However, with cumulative doses, doxorubicin also is known to have cardiotoxic effects, including cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Methods of reducing or preventing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity have been suggested, including an investigational doxorubicin analog, mitoxantrone ( Novantrone ). The most cardiotoxic drug, doxorubicin, is the most potent inducer of superoxide generation, while epirubicin, which is less cardiotoxic, has a relatively limited effect on superoxide production. The mechanism of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is likely multifactorial and most importantly, the genetic factors predisposing to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity are unknown. As doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is considered irreversible, early detection of cardiotoxicity and prevention of overt heart failure is essential. Although there are monitoring guidelines for cardiotoxicity, optimal timing for early detection of subclinical doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is still obscure. Quercetin attenuates doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by modulating Bmi-1 expression. However, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity of the heart has largely limited its clinical use. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I (top1mt) is a novel limiting factor of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy induces cardiotoxicity, which limits its clinical application. he clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) and other anthracyclines is limited by a dosage-dependent cardiotoxicity, which can lead to cardiomyopathy.  Besides its cardiotoxic effect, doxorubicin also elicits inflammatory effects in vivo. 7-Monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) has recently been used as a protector against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo. Doxorubicin is an effective antineoplastic agent, but it frequently causes dose-related cardiotoxic effects.  Among these analogs, idarubicin (4-demethoxy-daunorubicin) was shown to be less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin i Verapamil has also been suggested to potentiate the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin.  Doxorubicin treatment is associated with both acute and chronic cardiotoxicity.  cardiac effects of diclofenac sodium on doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats"
Doesn't d-tubocurarine (d-TC) induces irreversible inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction?,yes,"An integrated model describing the interaction of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents with reversible anticholinesterase agents is derived and compared with a naive model using experimental data obtained from four anesthetized dogs. Three consecutive but separate steady-state d-tubocurarine blocks (approximately 50, 70, and 90%) were induced in each of the four dogs and reversed by short edrophonium infusions. The ability of hexamethonium (C6) to reverse the neuromuscular blocking action of tubocurarine (Tc) Volatile anesthetics enhance the neuromuscular blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMRs). The neuromuscular junction is a postulated site of this interaction. We tested the hypothesis that volatile anesthetic enhancement of muscle relaxation is the result of combined drug effects on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Concentration-effect curves for the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents were established for vecuronium, d-tubocurarine, isoflurane, and sevoflurane. Subsequently, inhibitory effects of NDMRs were studied in the presence of the volatile anesthetics at a concentration equivalent to half the concentration producing a 50% inhibition alone. All individually tested compounds produced rapid and readily reversible concentration-dependent inhibition. The pharmacological diversity of the different isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor arises from the diversity of the subunits that assemble to form the native receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine in a reversible manner.  As further evidence of anticholinesterase activity, methamidophos (1-100 microM) was able to reverse the blockade by d-tubocurarine There was an initial partial reversal of the neuromuscular inhibition caused by tubocurarine Isoflurane and sevoflurane enhance the receptor blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Because other purinergic 2X (P2X) receptor antagonists, NF023 and NF279, do not have the reverse effects on the neuromuscular blockade of d-TC, the effect of NF449 seems irrelevant to inhibition of P2X receptors. The association rate constant for Tc binding to sites on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor appears to be very fast (k+D = 8.9 x 10(8) M-1 s-1) and comparable to that for acetylcholine (ACh). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism for the reversal effect of NF449 (a suramin analogue) on the neuromuscular block induced by d-tubocurarine (d-TC). Study of the reversal effect of NF449 on neuromuscular blockade induced by d-tubocurarine."
Are there randomised controlled trials on sevoflurane?,yes,"After Ethics Review Board approval, 44 ASA I-III patients undergoing elective gynaecological surgery were randomised after surgery to either hypercapnic hyperpnoea or control groups. Hypercapnic hyperpnoea in spontaneously breathing patients halves the time of recovery from sevoflurane-induced anaesthesia in the operating room. A total of 200 women undergoing first trimester abortion (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) participated in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either sevoflurane or propofol for short-term sedation. The results showed the incidence of dreaming was significantly different between anaesthesia groups with 60% (60/100) of the sevoflurane group and 33% (33/100) of the propofol group (P=0.000) Anaesthesia administered had no effect on patient satisfaction. The results suggest that the incidence of dreaming was not affected by recovery time. Patient satisfaction was not influenced by choice of sedative and/or by the occurrence of dreaming during sevoflurane or propofol short-term sedation. Prior reports suggest that dreaming during anaesthesia is dependent on recovery time. Dreaming during sedation may impact patient satisfaction Sevoflurane vs. propofol in patients with coronary disease undergoing mitral surgery: a randomised study. We therefore performed a randomised controlled trial (sevoflurane vs. propofol) to compare cardiac troponin release in patients with coronary disease undergoing mitral surgery. Myocardial injury in remifentanil-based anaesthesia for off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery: an equipotent dose of sevoflurane versus propofol This randomised controlled trial compared the effect of equipotent anaesthetic doses of sevoflurane (S group) versus propofol (P group), during remifentanil-based anaesthesia for off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, on myocardial injury. Either sevoflurane or propofol was titrated to maintain bispectral index values between 40 and 50. This randomised, multicentre, parallel-group trial included 98 adult patients. Patients received intravenous propofol for induction followed by sevoflurane maintenance anaesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated to receive sugammadex 2.0 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 microg We compared the haemodynamics, emergence and recovery characteristics of total intravenous anaesthesia using propofol/remifentanil with sevoflurane/remifentanil anaesthesia, under bispectral index guidance, in 103 patients undergoing surgical procedures lasting > 3.5 h A randomised controlled trial of paediatric conscious sedation for dental treatment using intravenous midazolam combined with inhaled nitrous oxide or nitrous oxide/sevoflurane Intravenous midazolam, especially in combination with inhaled nitrous oxide or sevoflurane and nitrous oxide, are effective techniques, with the combination of midazolam and sevoflurane the one most likely to result in successful treatment. We randomly assigned 1063 adult and 322 paediatric elective patients to one of four (adult) or two (paediatric) anaesthesia groups In both studies, there was no difference in postdischarge outcomes at Day 7. Sevoflurane/sevoflurane was more costly with higher PONV rates in both studies. In adults, the cost per extra episode of PONV avoided was pound 296 (propofol/propofol vs. propofol/ sevoflurane) and pound 333 (propofol/sevoflurane vs. propofol/isoflurane). Comparison of sevoflurane and nitrous oxide mixture with nitrous oxide alone for inhalation conscious sedation in children having dental treatment: a randomised controlled trial. We studied 411 children aged 3-10 years who were referred for dental treatment. They were randomly allocated to have inhalation conscious sedation with either sevoflurane/nitrous oxide mixture or nitrous oxide alone"
Does dronedarone  affect  T3 and T4 levels?,no,"Amiodarone resulted in increased T4, T4/T3 and rT3, whereas dronedarone did not alter the thyroid hormone profile in normal animals. Fifty-five Wistar rats were randomly allocated to a 2-week oral treatment with either vehicle (n=18), amiodarone (30 mg/kg, n=20), or dronedarone (30 mg/kg, n=17). Thyroid function was similar in the 3 groups. Plasma levels of T3, T4, and rT3 were changed after SR 33589 treatment except a decrease in T4 level at the highest dose whilst the T4 T3 ratio and the level of rT3 were dose-dependently increased by amiodarone treatment."
Isn't clathrin involved in E-cadherin endocytosis?,no,"We demonstrated that GnT-III induced a stabilizing effect on E-cadherin at the cell membrane by inducing a delay in the turnover rate of the protein, contributing for the formation of stable and functional adherens-junctions, and further preventing clathrin-dependent E-cadherin endocytosis. Conversely, GnT-V promotes the destabilization of E-cadherin, leading to its mislocalization and unstable adherens-junctions with impairment of cell-cell adhesion. Here we show that E-cadherin polarity is controlled by the polarized regulation of clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis. We delineate a pathway that controls the initiation of E-cadherin endocytosis through the regulation of AP2 and clathrin coat recruitment by E-cadherin. Clathrin dependent endocytosis of E-cadherin is regulated by the Arf6GAP isoform SMAP1 E-cadherin is a central component of the adherens junction in epithelial cells and continuously undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolae depending on the cell type. Collectively, SMAP1 likely represents a key Arf6GAP in clathrin dependent endocytosis of E-cadherin in MDCK cells. Consistent with these observations, we found that selective uncoupling of p120 from E-cadherin by introduction of amino acid substitutions in the p120-binding site increased the level of E-cadherin endocytosis. The increased endocytosis was clathrin-dependent, because it was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin or by hypertonic shock. We found that in this experimental system E-cadherin entered a transferrin-negative compartment before transport to the early endosomal compartment, where it merged with classical clathrin-mediated uptake pathways."
Is low T3 syndrome a prognostic marker in patients with renal insufficiency?,yes,"Low T3 was particularly common (44.3 %), and clearly associated with increased 6- and 12-month mortality and decreased overall survival (log rank test, P=0.007).  Increased rT3 may be more common in ESRD patients than previously described, and together with decreased T3 it may serve as an indicator of poor prognosis in subsequent months. The presence of TFT alterations seems to not be associated with clinical and prognostic implications in AKI patients. Multivariate analysis, according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, showed that mortality was best predicted by total triiodothyronine (T3). Finally, low T3 but not low free triiodothyronine was associated with worse all-cause (Likelihood ratio = 45.4; P < 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (Likelihood ratio = 47.8; P < 0.0001) after adjustment for confounding factors.  In Cox analyses, fT3 was a significant predictor of mortality independent of the main traditional as well as non-traditional risk factors. All-cause and CV mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with 'lower' T3 levels than in the 'higher' T3 group (113.4 vs 18.2 events per 1000 patient-years, P<0.001, and 49.8 vs 9.1 events per 1000 patient-years, P=0.001, respectively). The Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed significantly worse cumulative survival rates in the 'lower' T3 group (P<0.001). In the Cox regression analysis, low T3 was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality even after adjusting for traditional risk factors (hazard ratio=3.76, P=0.021).  In CKD patients with proteinuria, low T3 concentration predicted all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event independently of the severity of proteinuria. Low-T3 syndrome is a frequent finding among HD patients, but it does not predict outcome. However, serum fT3 level is a strong and inverse mortality predictor, in part explained by its underlying association with nutritional state and inflammation. These data suggest that low FT3 levels are not predictive for mortality in a subgroup of stable HD patients who could survive more than 12 months. Low fT3 is an independent predictor of death in hemodialysis patients. These data lend support to the hypothesis that thyroid dysfunction is implicated in the high risk of the ESRD population."

Zolpidem [N,N,6-trimethyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide hemitartrate] is reported to be a rapid onset, short duration hypnotic that interacts at the benzodiazepine recognition site. The imidazopyridine zolpidem is a short-acting hypnotic chemically distinct from benzodiazepines (BZs). According to its peculiar neuropharmacologic activity (selectivity for the omega 1-BZ receptors), zolpidem is expected to be a pure hypnotic, without the other effects of BZs."

Have C12orf65 mutations been associated with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy?,yes,"Novel C12orf65 mutations in patients with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type 6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6, but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been identified.METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion a childhood onset neuropathy and optic atrophy.

Could Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) be effective for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer?,yes,"The use of HIPEC after aggressive cytoreductive surgery in patients with ovarian cancer with peritoneal dissemination can be performed with acceptable postoperative morbidity rates. Knowledge of the factors associated with the onset of these postoperative adverse events allows better management of the same and offers the patient a safe procedure These results showed that the association of HIPEC with a complete cytoreduction for recurrent ovarian cancer presents acceptable morbidity and survival There is level-one evidence suggesting the benefit of postoperative adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery, albeit catheter-related complications resulted after treatment discontinuation. Studies report the use of HIPEC predominantly in the setting of recurrent disease and have demonstrated encouraging results, which merits further investigation in future clinical trials  The combination of SCR and HIPEC seems to improve survival rate in patients suffering from platinum-sensitive EOC recurrence with respect to no-HIPEC treatments. This result further supports the need of a randomized trial  Cautious extrapolation of data from standard normothermic, nonintraoperative, intraperitoneal chemotherapy and data from Phase II and nonrandomized comparative studies suggest that HIPEC delivered at the time of surgery for ovarian cancer has definite potential The available evidence suggests that a potential survival benefit of adding HIPEC may be largest in the settings of secondary CRS for stage III ovarian cancer and salvage CRS for recurrent ovarian cancer, two time-points representing failure of initial standard therapy. There is much less evidence for a potential benefit of HIPEC for less advanced stages (I-II) and for earlier time-points in the treatment of ovarian cancer (upfront, interval and consolidation) Survival benefit of adding Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) at the different time-points of treatment of ovarian cancer Patients suffering from peritoneal recurrence of ovarian cancer should be considered for radical reoperation with HIPEC in a center with expertise in multimodal therapeutic options. Organ-preserving cytoreductive surgery allows complete cytoreduction with the goal of decreasing morbidity  In recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients, the use of CRS plus HIPEC represents a safe treatment, able to significantly influence the survival rates compared to chemotherapy alone or surgery plus standard chemotherapy  The results of our study indicate the feasibility and the potential benefit of a protocol including systemic chemotherapy, surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian cancer. A phase III trial to compare this approach with conventional treatment is needed In selected patients with heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer, cytoreduction combined with HIPEC may provide a meaningful OS with acceptable morbidity. Optimal results are achieved in patients with a macroscopically complete resection and biologically favorable disease  HIPEC is a complement to radical surgery/ peritonectomy, which has been shown to be a surgical procedure with high tolerability, low morbimortality, enhanced survival and prolonged disease-free interval in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis for recurrent ovarian cancer  Despite the heterogeneity of the studies reviewed, current evidence suggest that complete CRS and HIPEC may be a feasible option with potential benefits that are comparable with the current standard of care. A randomized trial is required to establish the role of HIPEC in ovarian cancer in the majority of patients with primary and recurrent advanced ovarian cancer, cytoreductive surgery combined with HIPEC can lead to a substantial increase in subsequent rates of disease-free and overall survival  Peritonectomy procedures combined with HIPEC offer promising long-term survival in patients with diffuse peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis. They achieve high adequate primary and secondary surgical cytoreduction rates with acceptable morbidity and mortality Cytoreduction surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer improves progression-free survival, especially in BRCA-positive patients- a case-control study. Survival benefit of adding Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) at the different time-points of treatment of ovarian cancer: review of evidence. Some encouraging results have been reported by the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from ovarian cancer by complete surgical cytoreduction, peritonectomy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Although standard treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) consists of surgical debulking and intravenous platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy, favorable oncological outcomes have been recently reported with the use of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Trabectedin, Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and chemo-immunotherapy may be become a promising therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) represents a new treatment strategy aimed to improve outcome of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Favorable oncological outcomes have been reported in several trials with the introduction of Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) in the treatment of Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC).

Is desmin an intermediate filament protein involved in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)?,yes,"Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy (DRM) is a cardiac and skeletal muscle disease caused by mutations in the desmin (DES) gene. Mutations in the central 2B domain of DES cause skeletal muscle disease that typically precedes cardiac involvement. However, the prevalence of DES mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without skeletal muscle disease is not known. The lack of severe disruption of cytoskeletal desmin network formation seen with mutations in the 1A and tail domains suggests that dysfunction of seemingly intact desmin networks is sufficient to cause DCM. According to the predominant view, desmin mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated a family with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) associated with a novel desmin mutation and reviewed recent reports regarding the frequency of RCM in patients with desmin myopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by enlargement and dilation of all heart compartments associated with serious decrease of its contractile function. DCM hallmark is the combination of dystrophic and hypertrophic alterations of cardiomyocytes. Since the power output of cardiac cells is directly related to remodeling of their contractile machinery we investigated expression of selected contractile and cytoskeletal proteins in the left ventricle of DCM patients using immunoblotting. The content of the recognized protein markers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy such as tubulin, desmin and slow skeletal myosin heavy chain isoform, MHCbeta, was significantly elevated in DCM compared to normal myocardium. In contrast, overexpression of desmin filaments by itself is not detrimental to the heart. Although loss-of-function studies have been more limited, ablation of the desmin gene causes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, resulting in cardiomyopathy in mice. From function studies, abnormal desmin aggregation and disruption of the desmin networks resulting from expression of either mutant desmin or mutant CryAB have been shown to remodel the heart and compromise cardiac function, suggesting their synergistic roles in disease pathogenesis. A missense mutation in the desmin gene (DES) causes DCM in a human family. Mice deficient in desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate filament gene family, display defects in all muscle types and particularly in the myocardium. Desmin null hearts develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by extensive myocyte cell death, calcific fibrosis and multiple ultrastructural defects. Several lines of evidence suggest impaired vascular function in desmin null animals. Familial DCM is commonly inherited as autosomal dominant trait; less frequently it is autosomal recessive, X-linked or matrilinear. The disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Genes causally linked to this phenotype include dystrophin, dystrophin-associated glycoproteins, actin, desmin, beta-miosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, and mitochondrial DNA genes, mostly transfer RNAs. Examination of families has identified so far eight disease genes, namely the dystrophin, tafazzin, cardiac actin, desmin, lamin A/C, delta- sarcoglycan, cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain, and cardiac troponin T gene. Mutations of the desmin,   delta-sarcoglycan, the cardiac actin and beta-myosin heavy chain as well as the troponin T gene are known to cause autosomal dominant-dilated cardiomyopathy without other abnormalities. Autosomal dominant DCM is the most frequent form (56% of our cases), and several candidate disease loci have been identified by linkage analysis. Three disease genes are presently known: the cardiac actin gene, the desmin gene, and the lamin A/C gene. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Two genes have been identified for the X-linked forms (dystrophin and tafazzin), whereas three other genes (actin, lamin A/C, and desmin) cause autosomal dominant DCM; Desmin defects were also recently identified in 1 familial dilated cardiomyopathy. By candidate gene screening, the molecular diagnosis can be provided for dystrophin, DAG, mitochondrial DNA, actin and desmin gene defects. Desmin (z-bands) are partly destroyed in DCM. Anti-desmin antibody titers as indicators of a possible secondary immune response are found high in patients with acute myocarditis declining during reconvalescence and are also elevated in DCM.  Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, is a major target in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans and mice Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament, is involved in myofibrillar myopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle wasting"
Is siltuximab effective for Castleman disease?,yes,"Siltuximab: a targeted therapy for idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease. The recent approvals in North America, Europe and Brazil of siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, for iMCD now provide a safe and effective therapy that targets a key aspect of pathogenesis. In the first ever randomized, placebo-controlled trial in iMCD, siltuximab significantly reduced disease burden and symptoms in a large portion (34%) of patients. Despite recent significant advances in our understanding of this disease and the increasing therapeutic experience with rituximab, tocilizumab and siltuximab, there are still difficult questions concerning its aetiology, prognosis and optimal treatment. Emerging treatments in Castleman disease - a critical appraisal of siltuximab.  Siltuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to IL-6, has thus emerged as a promising treatment option in a disease lacking efficacious therapy. Here, we review the findings of recent studies evaluating single-agent siltuximab treatment in CD, including the first-ever randomized clinical trial in this disease.

Isn't there any role of 5hmC in T-cell development and differentiation?,no,"We have mapped 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at different stages of T-cell development in the thymus and T-cell differentiation in the periphery. We show that 5hmC is enriched in the gene body of highly expressed genes at all developmental stages and that its presence correlates positively with gene expression. Further emphasizing the connection with gene expression, we find that 5hmC is enriched in active thymus-specific enhancers and that genes encoding key transcriptional regulators display high intragenic 5hmC levels in precursor cells at those developmental stages where they exert a positive effect. Our data constitute a valuable resource that will facilitate detailed analysis of the role of 5hmC in T-cell development and differentiation.

Herein, we present a Phase Ib trial of the repurposed investigational drug AZD0530, a Src family kinase inhibitor specific for Fyn and Src kinase, for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The study was a 4-week Phase Ib multiple ascending dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AZD0530 in AD patients with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ranging from 16 to 26. A total of 24 subjects were recruited in three sequential groups, with each randomized to receive oral AZD0530 at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, or placebo daily for 4 weeks.  AZD0530 is reasonably safe and well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, achieving substantial central nervous system penetration with oral dosing at 100-125 mg.

Aren't there any DNMT3 proteins present in plants?,no,"De novo DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana is catalyzed by the methyltransferase DRM2, a homolog of the mammalian de novo methyltransferase DNMT3. Here we describe DNA methyltransferase genes from both Arabidopsis and maize that show a high level of sequence similarity to Dnmt3, suggesting that they encode plant de novo methyltransferases. Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity. The N termini of these methyltransferases contain a series of ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains.  BLASTX searches and phylogenetic analysis suggested that five cDNAs belonged to four classes (Dnmt1, Dnmt2, CMT and Dnmt3) of DNA methyltransferase genes."

Aren't conserved noncoding elements associated with developmental genes?,no,"Some characteristics of CNEs include their high frequency in mammalian genomes, their potential regulatory role in gene expression, and their enrichment in gene deserts nearby master developmental genes we review recent findings that disruptions of CNEs, within or at long distance from the coding sequences of key genes involved in NCC development, result in neurocristopathies via the alteration of tissue- or stage-specific long-distance regulation of gene expression Genomic regulatory blocks are chromosomal regions spanned by long clusters of highly conserved noncoding elements devoted to long-range regulation of developmental genes Analysis of CNEs, at least some of which are candidate regulatory elements, suggests that ancestral CNEs partitioned between gene duplicates. These results help explain the evolutionary pathways by which the developmentally important family of FgfD molecules arose and the deduced principles that guided FgfD evolution are likely applicable to the evolution of developmental regulation in many vertebrate multigene families Pan-vertebrate developmental cis-regulatory elements are discernible as highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) and are often dispersed over large areas around the pleiotropic genes whose expression they control.

HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish We show that human HCNEs result in expression patterns in zebrafish equivalent to those in mouse, establishing zebrafish as a suitable model for large-scale testing of human developmental enhancers HCNEs from the same area often drive overlapping patterns, suggesting that multiple regulatory inputs are required to achieve robust and precise complex expression patterns exhibited by developmental genes Organization of conserved elements near key developmental regulators in vertebrate genomes Further positional analysis of these conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the genome demonstrates that they cluster around genes involved in developmental regulation Ancora: a web resource for exploring highly conserved noncoding elements and their association with developmental regulatory genes Metazoan genomes contain arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) that span developmental regulatory genes and define regulatory domains The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs).

Is there any software for automated analysis of FISH images?,yes,"he study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH signal analysis that applying a CAD scheme to the automated generated 2-D projection images. A color imaging technique, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization (M-FISH), has been developed to ease the analysis of the process. Using an M-FISH technique each chromosome class (1,2, …,22,X,Y) is stained with a unique color. However, significant variations between images are observed due to a number of factors such as uneven hybridization and spectral overlap among channels. These types of variations influence the pixel classification accuracy of image classification methods which are supervised and require a set of annotated images for training. In this paper, we present a fully unsupervised M-FISH chromosome image classification methodology. Our main contributions are 1) the assumption that the intensity of a chromosome pixel is sampled from multiple Gaussian components [Gaussian mixture model (GMM)] such that each component corresponds to one chromosome class, and 2) the initialization of the GMM model using the emission information of each chromosome class. This is feasible since prior to the M-FISH image acquirement, we already know which chromosome class is emitting to each of the five M-FISH image channels. The method has been tested on a large number of M-FISH images and an overall accuracy of 89.85% is reported. Our method is unsupervised and presents higher classification accuracy even when it is compared with common supervised based methods. hybridization (FISH) tests provide promising molecular imaging biomarkers to more accurately and reliably detect and diagnose cancers and genetic disorders. Since current manual FISH signal analysis is low-efficient and inconsistent, which limits its clinical utility, developing automated FISH image scanning systems and computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes has been attracting research interests. To acquire high-resolution FISH images in a multi-spectral scanning mode, a huge amount of image data with the stack of the multiple three-dimensional (3-D) image slices is generated from a single specimen. Automated preprocessing these scanned images to eliminate the non-useful and redundant data is important to make the automated FISH tests acceptable in clinical applications. In this study, a dual-detector fluorescence image scanning system was applied to scan four specimen slides with FISH-probed chromosome X. A CAD scheme was developed to detect analyzable interphase cells and map the multiple imaging slices recorded FISH-probed signals into the 2-D projection images. CAD scheme was then applied to each projection image to detect analyzable interphase cells using an adaptive multiple-threshold algorithm, identify FISH-probed signals using a top-hat transform, and compute the ratios between the normal and abnormal cells. To assess CAD performance, the FISH-probed signals were also independently visually detected by an observer. The Kappa coefficients for agreement between CAD and observer ranged from 0.69 to 1.0 in detecting/counting FISH signal spots in four testing samples.  In this paper we developed a sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithm based on L1-norm minimization for classifying chromosomes from multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) images. The algorithm has been tested on a comprehensive M-FISH database that we established, demonstrating improved performance in classification. When compared with other pixel-wise M-FISH image classifiers such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms and adaptive fuzzy c-means (AFCM) clustering algorithms that we proposed earlier the current method gave the lowest classification error. In order to evaluate the performance of different SRC for M-FISH imaging analysis, three different sparse representation methods, namely, Homotopy method, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and Least Angle Regression (LARS), were tested and compared. Results from our statistical analysis have shown that Homotopy based method is significantly better than the other two methods.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to study the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes. The simultaneous detection of protein expression and gene copy number changes in patient samples, like paraffin-embedded tissue sections, is challenging since the procedures of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) negatively influence each other which often results in suboptimal staining. Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy number changes within the same cell. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of colorectal cancers were stained for CD133 expression. IHC images were acquired and image coordinates recorded. Slides were subsequently hybridized with fluorescently labeled DNA probes. FISH images were taken at the previously recorded positions allowing for direct comparison of protein expression and gene copy number signals within the same cells/tissue areas. Relocation, acquisition of the IHC and FISH images, and enumeration of FISH signals in the immunophenotyped tumour areas were done in an automated fashion. RESULTS: Automated FISH analysis was performed on 13 different colon cancer samples that had been stained for CD133; each sample was scored for MYC, ZNF217 and Chromosome 6 in CD133 positive and negative glands. From the 13 cases four (31%) showed amplification for the MYC oncogene and seven of 13 (54%) cases were amplified for ZNF217.

There was no significant difference between CD133 positive tumour and CD133 negative tumour cells."
Doesn't the Abelson-related gene (ARG) gene encode for a serine kinase?,yes,"One isoform of Arg/Abl2 tyrosine kinase is nuclear and the other seven cytosolic isoforms differently modulate cell morphology, motility and the cytoskeleton. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton.  The human Arg (Abl2) nonreceptor tyrosine kinase has a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements by its C-terminal F-actin- and microtubule-binding sequences.  The tyrosine kinase abl-related gene ARG is fused to ETV6 in an AML-M4Eo patient with a t(1;12)(q25;p13): molecular cloning of both reciprocal transcripts.  The ARG gene encodes for a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase characterized by high homology with c-Abl in the TK, SH2, and SH3 domains. This is the first report on ARG involvement in a human malignancy. Ultraviolet-A and -B differentially modify the tyrosine-kinase profile of human keratinocytes and induce the expression of Arg+. Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. To investigate the expression profile of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in response to UVA and UVB we employed a reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach using degenerate primers derived from the conserved catalytic domain of PTKs.  By 3'rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (3'RACE-PCR), a novel fusion transcript was identified between the ETV6 and the Abelson-related gene (ARG) at 1q25, resulting in a chimeric protein consisting of the HLH oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the SH2, SH3, and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domains of ARG. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton. Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. We studied the relationship of direct karyotypes, determined at diagnosis and remission, to Abelson-related tyrosine kinase activity and the cytogenetic features of erythroid and myeloid colonies derived from remission marrow of six children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ABL2/ARG (ABL-related gene) belongs to the ABL (Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase) family of tyrosine kinases The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton The ARG gene encodes for a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase characterized by high homology with c-Abl in the TK, SH2, and SH3 domains. ABL2/ARG (ABL-related gene) belongs to the ABL (Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase) family of tyrosine kinases. We report that the Abelson (Abl) and Abl-related gene (Arg) nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are required for maintenance of cortical dendrites in the mouse brain. The products of the human ARG gene and the human ABL gene characterize the Abelson family of non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases. The products of the human Arg gene and human, mouse, Drosophila, and nematode Abl genes characterize the Abelson family of nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinase.

A modified TALEN-based system for robust generation of knock-out human pluripotent stem cell lines and disease models. In this study, we utilized a cell-penetrating peptide-based system for ZFN and TALEN delivery. At all loci tested we obtained human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones carrying transgenic cassettes solely at the TALEN-specified location. We report here the use of TALENs to rapidly and efficiently generate mutant alleles of 15 genes in cultured somatic cells or human pluripotent stem cells, the latter for which we differentiated both the targeted lines and isogenic control lines into various metabolic cell types. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have been successfully used to knock out endogenous genes in stem cell research. Here we report different methods to efficiently perform TALEN-mediated gene integration and inactivation in different mammalian cell systems including induced pluripotent stem cells and delineate experimental examples associated with these approaches Together, our results demonstrate that TALE-based transcriptional repressor and TALENs are two promising approaches for loss-of-function studies of microRNA clusters in somatic cells and pluripotent stem cells We report here the use of TALENs to rapidly and efficiently generate mutant alleles of 15 genes in cultured somatic cells or human pluripotent stem cells, the latter for which we differentiated both the targeted lines and isogenic control lines into various metabolic cell types TALEN-mediated generation and genetic correction of disease-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells. Baculoviral transduction facilitates TALEN-mediated targeted transgene integration and Cre/LoxP cassette exchange in human-induced pluripotent stem cells. We used transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated gene editing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to produce mice with targeted gene disruptions and insertions in two Y-linked genes--Sry and Uty.  Using CRISPR-Cas9 and TALEN targeted human pluripotent stem cell clones, we performed whole-genome sequencing at high coverage in order to assess the degree of mutagenesis across the entire genome.  A 5% modification rate was observed in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) treated with TAT-TALEN as measured by the Surveyor assay.  TAT-TALEN protein-mediated gene disruption was applicable in hiPSCs and represents a promising technique for gene knockout in stem cells.

At all loci tested we obtained human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones carrying transgenic cassettes solely at the TALEN-specified location. Our data suggest that TALENs employing the specific architectures described here mediate site-specific genome modification in human pluripotent cells with similar efficiency and precision as do zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs)."

Doesn't oculocutaneous albinism show an autosomal recessive inheritance?,no,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypopigmentation in eyes, hair and skin, accompanied with vision loss.  Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive hereditary pigmentation disorder affecting humans and several other animal species.  Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) is a human autosomal-recessive hypopigmentation disorder associated with pathological mutations of the OCA2 gene. Oculocutaneous albinism type1 (OCA1) is characterized by the absence of melanin pigmentation. The mutation on TYR gene makes OCA1 as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder.  Our patients were diagnosed as affected with Oculocutaneous albinism type1a. Analysis of pedigree pattern showed an autosomal recessive inheritance.  Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder of melanin biosynthesis that results in congenital hypopigmentation of ocular and cutaneous tissues. Oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Melanin biosynthesis is reduced in oculocutaneous albinism, an autosomal recessive disorder. The pedigrees were consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.CONCLUSION: This unique type of oculocutaneous albinism has heterogeneous clinical features. BACKGROUND: Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive hereditary pigmentation disorder affecting humans and several other animal species. The Q402 allele has been associated with autosomal recessive ocular albinism when it is in trans with a tyrosinase gene mutation associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 1. Analysis using the POINTER program showed that this type of oculocutaneous albinism was inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with an estimated gene frequency of 0.025 +/- 0.007 in this population. We have identified 12 families with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 that exhibit segregation of the c.1205G>A variant with a known pathologic mutation on the homologous chromosome, and demonstrate no genetic association between autosomal recessive oculocutaneous albinism and the Q402 variant. BACKGROUND: Type II (tyrosinase-positive) oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive disorder that has recently been mapped to chromosome segment 15q11-q13. The child with ocular albinism was heterozygous for two different mutations in the P gene.CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of the P gene are associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes, including type II oculocutaneous albinism, albinism associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome, and at least some cases of autosomal recessive ocular albinism.

Doesn't the association of PARP1 and CTCF follow a circadian rhythm?,no,"here we uncovered an inter-chromosomal network connecting active loci enriched in circadian genes to repressed lamina-associated domains (LADs). Synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CTCF interactions, which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina, followed by the acquisition of repressive H3K9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation PARP1- and CTCF-regulated contacts between circadian loci and the repressive chromatin environment at the lamina therefore mediate circadian transcriptional plasticity. Synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CTCF interactions, which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina, followed by the acquisition of repressive H3K9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation. Furthermore, depletion of H3K9me2/3, inhibition of PARP activity by olaparib, or downregulation of PARP1 or CTCF expression counteracts both recruitment to the envelope and circadian transcription. PARP1- and CTCF-regulated contacts between circadian loci and the repressive chromatin environment at the lamina therefore mediate circadian transcriptional plasticity. transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin domains tend to segregate into separate sub nuclear compartments to maintain stable expression patterns however here we uncovered an inter chromosomal network connecting active loci enriched in circadian genes to repressed lamina associated domains lads the interactome is regulated by parp1 and its co factor ctcf they not only mediate chromatin fiber interactions but also promote the recruitment of circadian genes to the lamina synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in parp1 ctcf interactions which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina followed by the acquisition of repressive h3k9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation furthermore depletion of h3k9me2 3 inhibition of parp activity by olaparib or downregulation of parp1 or ctcf expression counteracts both recruitment to the envelope and circadian transcription parp1 and ctcf regulated contacts between circadian loci and the repressive chromatin environment at the lamina therefore mediate circadian transcriptional plasticity.

Are there clinical trials on stem cells in multiple sclerosis,yes,"Cells are generally given intravenously. Multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have been successfully treated in human clinical trials Human multipotent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies are currently being tested in clinical trials for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease, type 1 diabetes, bone fractures, cartilage damage, and cardiac diseases. Based on these results, several small pilot clinical trials in subjects with advanced MS have demonstrated that MSC administration is safe and provided an early signal of clinical effectiveness. The current aim of clinicians and scientists interested in the development of MSC-based strategies for the treatment of MS is to have the ultimate demonstration in large clinical trials that MSC can inhibit CNS inflammation and foster tissue repair Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) promote functional recovery in experimental models of central nervous system (CNS) pathology and are currently being tested in clinical trials for stroke, multiple sclerosis and CNS injury. Autologous bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) offer significant practical advantages for potential clinical applications in multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on recent experimental data, a number of clinical trials have been designed for the intravenous (IV) and/or intrathecal (ITH) administration of BMSCs in MS patients. Fingolimod is a S1P receptor modulator in MS clinical trials due to systemic anti-inflammatory properties, yet may impact cells within the CNS by crossing the blood-brain barrier. Their development in vitro and their use in vivo in animal models of degenerative neurological disease and recent first efforts in human clinical trials were the topics of a recent international meeting sponsored by the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society on ""Stem Cells & MS: Prospects and Strategies"" Here we discuss key observations and questions emerging from clinical trials of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for MS Another possibility to achieve remyelination is the transplantation of myelinating cells into the central nervous system. Proof of principle and demonstration of the functionality were shown in numerous experiments, and a first clinical trial in patients with MS has started This first trial will show if cell transplantation is a feasible concept in MS and whether the transplanted cells will survive and form new myelin."
Is shotgun lipidomics the direct infusion of a lipid sample into a mass spectrometer?,yes,"In direct infusion/injection (or shotgun) lipidomics An efficient shotgun lipidomics strategy was established and optimized for fast phospholipid profiling of viscera from three fish species: Lateolabrax japonicas, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, and Carassius auratus. This strategy relies on direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a tandem mass spectrometer without additional separation of the individual molecular species.  Top-down shotgun lipidomics relies on direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer shotgun lipidomic approaches that use direct infusion direct infusion (shotgun lipidomics)  direct infusion-based shotgun lipidomics approaches shotgun lipidomics (MDMS-SL) data, which are acquired directly from lipid extracts after direct infusion  Through direct infusion of the resultant enriched solution, we identified and quantitated a variety of very-low-abundance sphingolipid classes (e.g., sphingosine, psychosine, and lysosphingomyelin) and molecular species (e.g., sphingomyelin) using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (i.e., shotgun sphingolipidomics)."
Isn't there a crystal structure of the full-length of the flaviviridae NS5(Methyltransferase - RNA depended RNA Polymerase) ?,no,"flavivirus NS5 harbors a methyltransferase (MTase) in its N-terminal ≈ 265 residues and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) within the C-terminal part. One of the major interests and challenges in NS5 is to understand the interplay between RdRP and MTase as a unique natural fusion protein in viral genome replication and cap formation. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus.  (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular domains separated by a 10-residue linker. The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities. The C-terminal domain is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5. It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed. To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the full-length protein. NS5 was found to be monomeric and well-folded under the conditions tested. West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 protein contains a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in RNA capping and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain essential for virus replication. Crystal structures of individual WNV MTase and RdRp domains have been solved; however, the structure of full-length NS5 has not been determined. To gain more insight into the structure of NS5 and interactions between the MTase and RdRp domains, we generated a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the NS5 protein of WNV (Kunjin strain) and mapped their binding sites using a series of truncated NS5 proteins and synthetic peptides. Binding sites of four mAbs (5D4, 4B6, 5C11 and 6A10) were mapped to residues 354-389 in the fingers subdomain of the RdRp. This is consistent with the ability of these mAbs to inhibit RdRp activity in vitro and suggests that this region represents a potential target for RdRp inhibitors. Using a series of synthetic peptides, we also identified a linear epitope (bound by mAb 5H1) that mapped to a 13 aa stretch surrounding residues 47 and 49 in the MTase domain, a region predicted to interact with the palm subdomain of the RdRp. The failure of one mAb (7G6) to bind both N- and C-terminally truncated NS5 recombinants indicates that the antibody recognizes a conformational epitope that requires the presence of residues in both the MTase and RdRp domains."
Does echinacea increase anaphylaxis risk?,yes,"Chicoric acid (dicaffeoyl-tartaric acid), is a natural phenolic compound found in a number of plants, such as chicory (Cichorium intybus) and Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea), which possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and analgesic activities. Although these biological effects of chicoric acid have been investigated, there are no reports of its antiallergic-related anti-inflammatory effects in human mast cells (HMC)-1 or anaphylactic activity in a mouse model. BACKGROUND: Fifty percent of Australians use complementary and alternative medicines (other than vitamins) in any 12-month period, of which echinacea-containing products are increasingly popular. Recent reports have highlighted the risk of allergic reactions to complementary medicines in atopic patients. Two patients suffered anaphylaxis and a third had an acute asthma attack 10 minutes after their first ever dose of echinacea. Fifty-one Australian adverse drug reports implicating echinacea were also reviewed. There were 26 cases suggestive of possible immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity (4 anaphylaxis, 12 acute asthma, 10 urticaria/angioedema).  Echinacea-associated anaphylaxis. A woman with atopy experienced anaphylaxis after taking, among other dietary supplements, a commercial extract of echinacea. Risk of anaphylaxis in complementary and alternative medicine. Several culprits identified including Andrographis paniculata, Echinacea species, bee products, Ginkgo biloba and Ginseng are discussed here.SUMMARY: Knowing the factors that increase the risk of anaphylaxis allows reactions to be recognized, reported and further investigated."
Are hepadnaviral minichromosomes free of nucleosomes?,no,"Several nucleosome-protected sites in a region of the DHBV genome [nucleotides (nt) 2000 to 2700], known to harbor various cis transcription regulatory elements, were consistently identified in all DHBV-positive liver samples. In addition, we observed other nucleosome protection sites in DHBV minichromosomes that may vary among individual ducks, but the pattern of MNase mapping in those regions is transmittable from the adult ducks to the newly infected ducklings. nucleosomes along viral cccDNA in the minichromosomes are not random but sequence-specifically positioned. Investigators studying the structure and function of hepadnaviral CCC DNA (3) have provided evidence that suggests that this structure exists in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes as a heterogeneous population of viral minichromosomes, which range from half to fully chromatinized, thought to be owing to their association with variable numbers of nucleosomes. Characterization of nucleosome positioning in hepadnaviral covalently closed circular DNA minichromosomes. To obtain insight on the structure of hepadnaviral cccDNA minichromosomes, we utilized ducks infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) as a model and determined the in vivo nucleosome distribution pattern on viral cccDNA by the micrococcal nuclease (MNase) mapping and genome-wide PCR amplification of isolated mononucleosomal DHBV DNA. Mature SV40 minichromosomes are estimated to contain about 27 nucleosomes (error +/- 2), except for those molecules with a nucleosome-free gap, which are interpreted to contain 25 nucleosomes (error +/- 2). In vitro replication in the presence of protein-free competitor DNA shows that replicating trypsinized minichromosomes do not lose nucleosomes and replicating competitor DNA does not gain nucleosomes. In vitro replication in the presence of protein-free competitor DNA shows that replicating trypsinized minichromosomes do not lose nucleosomes and replicating competitor DNA does not gain nucleosomes. We conclude that in both cases parental nucleosomes are transferred to progeny DNA, and, in addition, that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurs during the replication of native minichromosomes. In contrast, the replicated untreated minichromosomes were found to be densely packed with nucleosomes, indicating that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurred during in vitro replication. Investigators studying the structure and function of hepadnaviral CCC DNA (3) have provided evidence that suggests that this structure exists in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes as a heterogeneous population of viral minichromosomes, which range from half to fully chromatinized, thought to be owing to their association with variable numbers of nucleosomes To obtain insight on the structure of hepadnaviral cccDNA minichromosomes, we utilized ducks infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) as a model and determined the in vivo nucleosome distribution pattern on viral cccDNA by the micrococcal nuclease (MNase) mapping and genome-wide PCR amplification of isolated mononucleosomal DHBV DNA Characterization of nucleosome positioning in hepadnaviral covalently closed circular DNA minichromosomes.

Isn't Kanzaki disease associated with deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase?,no,"Kanzaki disease (OMIM#104170) is attributable to a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA; E.C.3.2.1.49), which hydrolyzes GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr.   Our findings suggest that the association of alpha-NAGA with its substrates is strongly affected by the amino acid substitution at R329 and that the association with GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr is more highly susceptible to structural changes. The residual mutant enzyme in R329W could not associate with GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr and GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser. However, the residual mutant enzyme in R329Q catalyzed GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser to some extent. Therefore, the urinary ratio of GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser:GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr was lower and the clinical phenotype was milder in the R329Q mutation.  Kanzaki disease (OMIM#104170) is attributable to a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA; E.C.3.2.1.49), which hydrolyzes GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr.

Do patients with Pendred syndrome present congenital deafness?,yes,"Pendred Syndrome can be characterized by the triad composed of familial goitre, abnormal perchlorate discharge and congenital deafness. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter.  Pendred syndrome comprises congenital sensorineural hearing loss, thyroid goiter, and positive perchlorate discharge test.  The cause of the congenital deafness in Pendred syndrome is obscure, although a Mondini type malformation of the cochlea exists in some patients. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter. Pendred syndrome is the autosomal recessively transmitted association of familial goiter and congenital deafness. Pendred syndrome (PDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness, goiter and iodide organification defect. Pendred syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder with the hallmark features of congenital deafness and thyroid goitre. Pendred syndrome, a common autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter, is caused by mutations of SLC26A4, which codes for pendrin. These studies provide compelling evidence that defects in pendrin cause Pendred syndrome thereby launching a new area of investigation into thyroid physiology, the pathogenesis of congenital deafness and the role of altered sulphate transport in human disease. Mutations in the Pendred syndrome gene have been observed in patients with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation, in the absence of other Pendred syndrome features. The occurrence of congenital deafness, mutism and goitre unassociated with cretinism or mental retardation in euthyroid patients is known as Pendred's Syndrome. The autosomal recessive Pendred's syndrome is defined by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. Pendred's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by goiter, impaired iodide organification, and congenital sensorineural deafness. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. Pendred's syndrome is manifested by congenital sensorineural deafness in association with familial goiter due to defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. Although the textbook view of the Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterised by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all patients present this classical clinical description. Pendred's syndrome may account for up to 10% of the cases with hereditary hearing loss, and pendrin mutations have also been found in a kindred with non-syndromic deafness. Pendred syndrome comprises the association of severe congenital sensorineural deafness with thyroid pathology. The first one is named Pendred Syndrome (PS) when deafness is associated with thyroid goiter; the second is called DFNB4, when no other symptoms are present. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, a partial defect in iodide organification, and dyshormonogenetic goiter. Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic recessive deafness associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (NSRD with EVA) are caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 (PDS) gene. Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture.  The occurrence of congenital deafness, mutism and goitre unassociated with cretinism or mental retardation in euthyroid patients is known as Pendred's Syndrome.  The cause of the congenital deafness in Pendred syndrome is obscure, although a Mondini type malformation of the cochlea exists in some patients.  The discovery of mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in patients with Pendred syndrome (congenital deafness, goiter, and defective iodide organification) suggested a possible role for the encoded protein, pendrin, as an apical iodide transporter.  Pendred syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder with the hallmark features of congenital deafness and thyroid goitre.  Pendred&apos;s syndrome is manifested by congenital sensorineural deafness in association with familial goiter due to defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. The majority of patients with Pendred&apos;s syndrome are euthyroid. We report on an unusual case of a patient with Pendred&apos;s syndrome presenting with amenorrhea and late-onset hypothyroidism.  Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome. The occurrence of congenital deafness, mutism and goitre unassociated with cretinism or mental retardation in euthyroid patients is known as Pendred&apos;s Syndrome. It has been estimated that 4-10 % of children with congenital deafness suffer from this condition. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome. Since this is the most common radiological malformation of the cochlea in deaf patients, we investigated what proportion of such cases were due to mutation of the PDS gene. Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome."
Can't RNAPolII function as an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase?,no,"RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. . Our studies provide compelling evidence that mammalian Pol II acts as an RdRP to control the stability of a cellular RNA by extending its 3'-end. here is, however, evidence that Pol II also possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes. The present findings provide a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanistic principles of transcription by a viral RNA polymerase and have implications for the regulation of Pol II activities in infected cells. Influenza A virus transcribes its segmented negative sense RNA genome in the nuclei of infected cells in a process long known to require host RNA polymerase II (RNAP-II). We conclude that influenza A virus replication requires RNAP-II activity not just to provide capped mRNA substrates but also to facilitate nuclear export of selected viral mRNAs. Thus, influenza virus specifically interferes with Pol II elongation, but not Pol II initiation. We propose that influenza virus RNA polymerase, by binding to the CTD of initiating Pol II and subsequent cleavage of the capped 5' end of the nascent transcript, triggers premature Pol II termination. We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) preinitiation complex recruitment and H3 Lys 4 (H3-K4) methylation at the Xist promoter form the basis of the Xist expression profiles that drives both imprinted and random XCI. Identification of these ENL-associated proteins (EAPs) by mass spectrometry revealed enzymes with a known role in transcriptional elongation (RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [RNAPolII CTD] positive transcription elongation factor b [pTEFb]), and in chromatin modification (histone-H3 methyltransferase DOT1L) as well as other frequent MLL partners (AF4, AF5q31, and LAF4), and polycomb group members (RING1, CBX8, and BCoR). RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA. Association of the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with cellular RNA polymerase II. It is also well established that viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRNP) associates with cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II), on which viral replication depends.  RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Natural cellular RNA substrates of mammalian Pol II, however, have not been identified and the cellular function of the Pol II RdRP activity is unknown. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA."
Is there a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns?,yes,"In addition, unlike MNase, MPE-Fe(II) cleaves nuclear DNA with little sequence bias. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. Micrococcal nuclease does not substantially bias nucleosome mapping. MNase has hitherto been very widely used to map nucleosomes, although concerns have been raised over its potential to introduce bias. These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. Standardized collection of MNase-seq experiments enables unbiased dataset comparisons. Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the resulting fragments. We propose that combined MNase/exoIII digestion can be applied to in situ chromatin for unbiased genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positions that is not influenced by DNA sequences at the core/linker junctions. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques.

These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant.. Micrococcal nuclease does not substantially bias nucleosome mapping. We find that maize MNase-hypersensitive (MNase HS) regions localize around active genes and within recombination hotspots, focusing biased gene conversion at their flanks."

Can't NEECHAM Confusion Scale be used for evaluation of postoperative delirium?,no,"Sampling was achieved in a nonrandomized targeted manner and delirium was assessed using NeeCham questionnaire.  Delirium in older patients: a diagnostic study of NEECHAM Confusion Scale in surgical intensive care unit. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the diagnostic value and determine the feasibility of the NEECHAM Confusion Scale on critically ill older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study confirm the good diagnostic value and ease of application of the NEECHAM scale with nonventilated intensive care patients.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The NEECHAM scale can be used to detect delirium during the routine nursing assessment of nonintubated older patients as it requires minimal demand and stress on the patient as well as on the bedside nurse. The NEECHAM Confusion Scale and the validated chart review instrument were used for diagnosis of delirium.  Among the various screening instruments, NEECHAM confusion scale and delirium observation scale appear to be most suitable screening instrument for patients' in general medical and surgical wards, depending on the type of rater (physician or nurse).  Use of NEECHAM scaling enabled medical staff to identify cases of possible confusion early, indicating that the NEECHAM confusion scale should be useful for the detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in the surgical ward. Early detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in a surgical ward using the NEECHAM confusion scale.

Couldn't hypophosphatemic rickets cause craniosynostosis?,no,"This study examines a series of patients with hypophosphatemic rickets and craniosynostosis to characterize the clinical course and associated craniofacial anomalies.  Hypophosphatemic rickets and craniosynostosis: a multicenter case series. A 20-year retrospective review identified patients with hypophosphatemic rickets and secondary craniosynostosis at 3 major craniofacial centers.  Secondary craniosynostosis develops postnatally due to metabolic or mechanical factors. The most common metabolic cause is hypophosphatemic rickets, which has a variety of etiologies. Head shape changes occur later and with a more heterogeneous presentation compared with that of primary craniosynostosis. Patients with multisutural involvement or X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets had a significant delay in presentation for craniosynostosis.  Craniosynostosis can be gene-linked, or caused by metabolic diseases, such as rickets, which results from a deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus or calcium leading to hypomineralization of the bone. X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (XLHR) is the most prevalent genetic type of hypophosphatemic rickets and is caused by germ line mutations in the PHEX-gene. In XLHR, only few case reports of craniosynostosis were described. Papilledema in the setting of x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets with craniosynostosis. Case report of a 3-year-old female presenting with papilledema resulting from craniosynostosis secondary to XLH. X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets and craniosynostosis. X-linked hypophosphatemic (XLH) rickets is the most common form of metabolic rickets, and there have been reports linking XLH rickets to craniosynostosis. A clinical report of a patient with XLH rickets and craniosynostosis is presented with a review of literature.  This may be the reason for the common association of craniosynostosis and XLH rickets.  Craniosynostosis and associated craniofacial deformities, such as frontal bossing, often occur as symptoms of vitamin D-resistant rickets in children. Similar skull deformities develop in mice with X-linked dominant hypophosphatemia, the most common form of vitamin D-resistant rickets.  The x-linked hypophosphatemic mouse is an animal model that can be used to study the role of vitamin D-resistant rickets in the development of craniosynostosis, to relate craniosynostosis to the development of associated skull deformities, and to test new treatment procedures. Craniosynostosis secondary to rickets is rarely reported, but since neither rickets nor craniosynostosis is a reportable disease, the exact incidence of both diseases is unknown. X-linked hypophosphatemic (XLH) rickets is the most common form of metabolic rickets, and there have been reports linking XLH rickets to craniosynostosis. A clinical report of a patient with XLH rickets and craniosynostosis is presented with a review of literature.

Is diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membranes?,yes,"A unique organelle for studying membrane biochemistry is the mitochondrion whose functionality depends on a coordinated supply of proteins and lipids. Mitochondria are capable of synthesizing several lipids autonomously such as phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin and in part phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid and CDP-diacylglycerol. A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane.  Diphosphatidylglycerol was confined to the mitochondrial fraction, where it represented about 7% of the total phosphoacylglycerols.  Mitochondrial membranes were isolated from the myocardium of young (4-month-old) and aged (33-month-old) male Long-Evans rats and compared in terms of cholesterol content and phospholipid and fatty acid composition. In aged rats, as compared to young, the major observations include: markedly higher cholesterol content; increased percentage of sphingomyelin and diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin);  The polyglycerophosphatides (typified by diphosphatidylglycerol) were apparently synthesized in situ by intramitochondrial membrane-bound enzymes using CDP-diglycerides as intermediates.  Both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions contained significant proportions of solvent front phospholipid (SFP) and whereas the mitochondrial SFP displayed the relatively unsaturated fatty acid composition characteristic of diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin), the fatty acids of the microsomal SFP were distinctly more saturated. Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). The enzyme responsible for the conversion of phosphatidylglycerol to diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) in the presence of cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol is firmly associated with mitochondrial membranes and is not extracted with hypotonic or hypertonic media or with nonionic detergents. The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria. In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold. Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). 90% or more of the phospholipid, cardiolipin was found in the mitochondrial membranes of wild type and petite yeast. Furthermore, the same mechanism for the biosynthesis of cardiolipin was operational in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria Cardiolipin (CL) is a key phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, playing important roles in maintaining the functional integrity and dynamics of mitochondria in animals and yeasts Cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondria, is involved in the biogenesis, the dynamics, and the supramolecular organization of mitochondrial membranes Cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, is crucial for both mitochondrial function and cellular processes outside of the mitochondria Since it has been recognized that mitochondria are crucial not only for energy metabolism but also for other cellular functions, there has been a growing interest in cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes Cardiolipin, the main anionic phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, is expected to be a determinant in this adaptive mechanism since it modulates the activity of most membrane proteins Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) Cardiolipin is normally localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane; however, when cardiolipin becomes externalized to the surface of dysregulated mitochondria, it promotes inflammasome activation and stimulates the elimination of damaged or nonfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold.  Increasing levels of cardiolipin differentially influence packing of phospholipids found in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae subjected to conditions that affect mitochondrial metabolism as a model to determine the possible role of cardiolipin in stress adaptation.  This decline of respiration was attributed to a progressive diminution of the number of mitochondria in copper-treated cells, based on the demonstration of the concomitant decline of (1) cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) and cytochrome aa3 (cytochrome oxidase), two specific markers of mitochondrial inner membrane, and (2) fumarase activity, a specific marker of mitochondrial matrix space. Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) or cardiolipin, a specific component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, represents about 4% of the total lipid content. Experimental results confirmed that the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, from the membrane-bound radioactive phosphatidylglycerol in intact mitochondria isolated from guinea pig and rat liver, was absolutely dependent on CDP-diglycerides and required the addition of divalent cations. We have shown that decrease of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membrane occurs early during ischemia, and only during the irreversible phase of ischemia are phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine broken down. Partial purification of diphosphatidylglycerol synthetase from liver mitochondrial membranes. A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane."
Is sonidegib effective for basal cell carcinoma?,yes,"This review of the literature aims to describe previous and current treatment options for oral therapy in locally advanced and metastatic NMSC otherwise unamenable to standard treatment. Oral Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors Vismodegib, Sonidegib, and Taladegib have shown to be effective in several trials.  Sonidegib is a new smoothened inhibitor currently under investigation for treatment of laBCC, which demonstrates a comparable safety profile to vismodegib.  The recent development of novel hedgehog pathway inhibitors for high-risk BCC (including oral vismodegib and sonidegib) may represent a paradigm shift towards medical management of NMSC. Sonidegib (Odomzo®), an oral smoothened (SMO) antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy, or adults with recurrent laBCC following surgery or radiation therapy.  The acceptable benefit-risk profile of sonidegib, along with a paucity of treatment options and the seriousness of the condition, makes sonidegib an emerging option for the treatment of adults with laBCC that has recurred following surgery or radiation therapy, or in those who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy.

Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,yes,"Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage specification gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive and definitive hematopoietic progenitors, gfi1b is required for definitive hematopoiesis LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b GFI1 and GFI1B control the loss of endothelial identity of hemogenic endothelium during hematopoietic commitment  Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium A short Gfi-1B isoform controls erythroid differentiation Gfi-1B is a transcriptional repressor essential for the regulation of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis Among the few down-regulated genes was Gfi1b, a known repressor of erythroid differentiation This reversible modulation of endothelial-haematopoietic state is accomplished by targeting key haematopoietic transcription factors for downregulation, including Runx1, Gata1, Gfi1B, Ikaros, and PU.1 Gfi1 and Gfi1b: key regulators of hematopoiesis we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of these proteins. Gfi-1B controls human erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation by regulating TGF-beta signaling at the bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitor stage Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis We here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors To date, we have identified two common integration sites involving genes encoding transcription factors that play a critical role in hematopoiesis (Evi1 and Gfi1b loci) Transcription factors play essential roles in both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. This is the case for the growth factor independent 1b (GFI1B) transcription factor, which is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and over-expressed in leukemic patients and cell lines We localized several conserved non-coding elements containing multiple erythroid specific transcription factor binding sites at the GFI1B locus. In GFI1B-expressing cells a subset of these conserved non-coding elements and the promoter adopt a close spatial conformation, localize with open chromatin sites, harbor chromatin modifications associated with gene activation and bind multiple transcription factors and co-repressors Our findings indicate that GFI1B regulatory elements behave as activators and repressors To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B), a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages Our data indicate that Gfi-1B signalling is important for commitment and maturation of hematopoietic cell populations Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b are homologous transcriptional repressors involved in diverse developmental contexts, including hematopoiesis and oncogenesis Gfi1b:green fluorescent protein knock-in mice reveal a dynamic expression pattern of Gfi1b during hematopoiesis that is largely complementary to Gfi1 We found highly dynamic expression patterns of Gfi1b in erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and their progenitor cells (MEPS) where Gfi1 is not detected. Vice versa, Gfi1b could not be found in granulocytes, activated macrophages, or their granulomonocytic precursors (GMPs) or in mature naive or activated lymphocytes where Gfi1 is expressed, suggesting a complementary regulation of both loci during hematopoiesis Gfi1 and Gfi1b act equivalently in haematopoiesis our findings show that an intact SNAG domain is essential for all functions of Gfi1 and that Gfi1b can replace Gfi1 functionally in haematopoiesis Gfi-1 oncoproteins in hematopoiesis Recent gene targeting experiments and mutational screening in humans have revealed an essential role for Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis Gfi-1B disruption is embryonic lethal due to a block of erythropoiesis. Gfi-1B is required for both erythroid and megakaryocyte development Erythroid expansion mediated by the Gfi-1B zinc finger protein: role in normal hematopoiesis  we identified that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes These findings establish Gfi-1B as a novel erythroid regulator and reveal its specific involvement in the regulation of erythroid cell growth through modulating erythroid-specific gene expression The zinc-finger proto-oncogene Gfi-1b is essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages we establish that Gfi-1b is required for the development of two related blood lineages, erythroid and megakaryocytic, in mice Gfi-1b(-/-) embryonic stem cells fail to contribute to red cells of adult chimeras. Gfi-1b(-/-) embryos exhibit delayed maturation of primitive erythrocytes and subsequently die with failure to produce definitive enucleated erythrocytes Gfi-1b is an essential transcriptional regulator of erythroid and megakaryocyte development Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding repressor of transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis. Conversely, loss of gfi1b silences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for definitive hematopoiesis. Gfi1b:green fluorescent protein knock-in mice reveal a dynamic expression pattern of Gfi1b during hematopoiesis that is largely complementary to Gfi1. Gfi1 and Gfi1b: key regulators of hematopoiesis. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. Growth factor independence 1b (gfi1b) is important for the maturation of erythroid cells and the regulation of embryonic globin expression. Growth factor-independence 1b (Gfi1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. In fact, we demonstrate that VPA treatment is able to induce the expression of growth factor-independent protein 1B (GFI1B) and of mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to chromosome 3 protein (MLLT3), which are crucial regulators of erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation, and that the up-regulation of these genes is mediated by the histone hyperacetylation at their promoter sites. Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) gene is an erythroid-specific transcription factor, whose expression plays an essential role in erythropoiesis. Evidence that growth factor independence 1b regulates dormancy and peripheral blood mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. We report here that adult mice conditionally deficient for the transcription Growth factor independence 1b (Gfi1b) show a significant expansion of functional HSCs in the bone marrow and blood.

Aren't there mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions?,no,"Genome-wide characterization of mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions. Gene expression in mammals is precisely regulated by the combination of promoters and gene-distal regulatory regions, known as enhancers. Several studies have suggested that some promoters might have enhancer functions. However, the extent of this type of promoters and whether they actually function to regulate the expression of distal genes have remained elusive. Here, by exploiting a high-throughput enhancer reporter assay, we unravel a set of mammalian promoters displaying enhancer activity. These promoters have distinct genomic and epigenomic features and frequently interact with other gene promoters. Extensive CRISPR-Cas9 genomic manipulation demonstrated the involvement of these promoters in the cis regulation of expression of distal genes in their natural loci. Our results have important implications for the understanding of complex gene regulation in normal development and disease.

Can we use platelet biomarkers to study Alzheimer's disease?,yes,"Platelet biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease. platelets are the most important source of circulating forms of the amyloid precursor protein and other important proteins such as Tau and glycogen synthase kinase-3B. Alternative plasma and platelet measures are described, The success of these studies led to the application of platelet proteomics to the study of several pathologies where platelets play a fundamental role. Those include platelet-related disorders, such as storage pool disease, gray platelet syndrome, and Quebec platelet disorder; diseases where unwanted platelet activation is highly relevant, such as thrombosis and cardiovascular disease; and other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, uremia, or Alzheimer's disease."
Isn't ocular melanosis a risk factor for uveal melanoma?,no,"Ocular/oculodermal (oculo[dermal]) melanocytosis is a congenital periocular pigmentary condition that can lead to the development of uveal melanoma, estimated at 1 in 400 affected patients. Melanosis oculi is often underestimated as a risk factor for uveal melanoma and glaucoma. Ophthalmic surveillance, every 6 or 12 months is important, in patients with ocular melanocytosis for early detection of high risk diseases.  One of about 400 patients with ODM followed for life is estimated to develop uveal melanoma. Excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in ODM may provide the biologic basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma. Patients with ODM should be monitored ophthalmoscopically, especially during the susceptible period, for the development of uveal melanoma. The authors suggest that a national registry of ODM patients be created and prospective data collected to better assess the risk of developing uveal melanoma. In the white population, an association between oculo(dermal) melanocytosis (ODM) and uveal melanoma is well recognized.  Malignant melanomas may arise in the uveal tract, the conjunctiva, the skin of the eyelid, or the orbit. Risk factors so far identified include pre-existing choroidal naevi for uveal melanomas, primary acquired melanosis (PAM) for conjunctival tumours, and ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis for uveal and orbital lesions.  Risk factors so far identified include pre-existing choroidal naevi for uveal melanomas, primary acquired melanosis (PAM) for conjunctival tumours, and ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis for uveal and orbital lesions. Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis of cesioflammea type in 7 patients: combination of ocular pigmentation (melanocytosis or melanosis) and nevus flammeus with risk for melanoma. In the fourth case the melanoma was detected in a routine examination and we were able to apply a preserving treatment with I125 brachytherapy.DISCUSSION: Melanosis oculi is often underestimated as a risk factor for uveal melanoma and glaucoma. Association of ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis with the rate of uveal melanoma metastasis: analysis of 7872 consecutive eyes. Risk factors so far identified include pre-existing choroidal naevi for uveal melanomas, primary acquired melanosis (PAM) for conjunctival tumours, and ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis for uveal and orbital lesions In the fourth case the melanoma was detected in a routine examination and we were able to apply a preserving treatment with I125 brachytherapy.Melanosis oculi is often underestimated as a risk factor for uveal melanoma and glaucoma In this study, patients with melanocytosis who developed uveal melanoma were found to have double the risk for metastasis compared with those without melanocytosis.To determine the relationship of oculo(dermal) melanocytosis to the prognosis of patients with uveal melanoma.Retrospective chart review of 7872 patients with uveal melanoma treated at the Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Institute, from August 25, 1970, through August 27, 2008.Enucleation, plaque radiotherapy, local resection, or thermotherapy.Metastasis and death.Of 7872 patients with uveal melanoma, oculo(dermal) melanocytosis was present in 230 (3%) By multivariable analysis, the factors predictive of metastasis in patients harboring uveal melanoma associated with oculo(dermal) melanocytosis were increased tumor thickness (P = .001) and the presence of subretinal fluid (P = .05), and the only factor predictive of death was increased tumor thickness (P = .009).  In the fourth case the melanoma was detected in a routine examination and we were able to apply a preserving treatment with I125 brachytherapy.Melanosis oculi is often underestimated as a risk factor for uveal melanoma and glaucoma.

Are the Fanconi anemia genes a part of the same signalling pathway?,yes,"Mutations in at least 14 different genes have been shown to cause FA The FA genes code for proteins that act in complexes to coordinate the repair of damaged DNA  The current review describes the structure and function of the Fanconi anemia genes and describes the role of the encoded Fanconi anemia proteins in a cellular pathway controlling chromosome stability. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare human genetic disease caused by mutations in any one of 13 known genes that encode proteins functioning in one common signaling pathway, the FA pathway, or in unknown genes. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited recessive disease caused by mutations in one of fifteen genes known to encode FA pathway components. Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins function in a DNA damage response pathway that appears to be part of the network including breast cancer susceptibility gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Are there any Decision support systems for chronic pain management ?,yes,"a project to operationalize the 2003 VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guideline for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain into a computerized decision support system (DSS) We based the DSS on the existing ATHENA-DSS Use of this iterative process led to development of a multifunctional DSS interactive decision dashboard format We created a computerized, interactive clinical decision dashboard  Interactive decision dashboards can be adapted for clinical use and have the potential to foster informed decision making. Clinical decision support systems are promising tools for improving behavioral medicine care for chronic pain. Improving Patient Safety Using ATHENA-Decision Support System Technology:  ATHENA-DSS is an automated decision support system developed in a collaboration between Stanford University and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to increase guideline-adherent prescribing and to change physician behavior. The use of a computer-based decision support system facilitates primary care physicians' management of chronic pain. The use of a CBDS system may improve the ability of PCPs to manage chronic pain and may also facilitate screening of consults to optimize specialist utilization."
Can cognitive behavioral therapy don't improve fatigue in cancer patients?,no,"Physical activity, educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have the most supportive data and can be recommended to patients with confidence.  For women undergoing radiotherapy (3 RCTs), hypnosis combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy improved distress and fatigue. Patients in the CBT group reported a significantly larger decrease in fatigue scores than patients in the waiting list group. However, relative to VCBT-I, PCBT-I was associated with significantly greater improvements of insomnia severity, early morning awakenings, depression, fatigue, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep.  CBT-I may also improve mood, fatigue, and overall quality of life, and can be successfully delivered through a variety of treatment modalities, making it possible to reach a broader range of patients who may not have access to more traditional programs.  No group differences in improvement were noted relative to QOL, fatigue, or mood.  In case of persistent fatigue, personalized cognitive behavioral therapy can be considered. ONCLUSION: The results support CBTH as an evidence-based intervention to control fatigue in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer.  Severe fatigue after cancer treatment can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but it is unclear whether CBT has an effect on cognitive functioning. CONCLUSION: CBT for post-cancer fatigue has already been shown to be an effective therapy.  Frequently reported side effects include cancer-related fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and psychological distress. Exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions have counteracted such adverse effects in other cancer populations.  There is evidence from methodologically rigorous controlled trials that exercise, psycho-educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia are effective in the treatment of CRF, and a wide range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions has shown initial promise in single-arm pilot studies with small, heterogeneous samples.  CONCLUSIONS: Physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy and physical training alone had significant and beneficial effects on fatigue compared with no intervention. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training. RESULTS: Imagery/hypnosis and CBT/CST interventions have produced improvement in all the three cancer-related symptoms individually: pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling indicated that for weekly FACIT fatigue data, there was a significant effect of the CBTH intervention on the rate of change in fatigue (p < .05), such that on average, CBTH participants' fatigue did not increase over the course of treatment, whereas control group participants' fatigue increased linearly. ONCLUSION: The results suggest that CBTH is an effective means for controlling and potentially preventing fatigue in breast cancer radiotherapy patients. Results were consistent with the view that CBTH was effective in managing fatigue and skin discomfort, and increasing relaxation. RESULTS: Participants in the Internet group showed significant improvements at post-assessment compared with those in the control group in overall insomnia severity (F(1,26) = 22.8; p<0.001), sleep efficiency (F(1,24) = 11.45; P = 0.002), sleep onset latency (F(1,24) = 5.18; P = 0.03), soundness of sleep (F(1,24) = 9.34; P = 0.005), restored feeling upon awakening (F(1,24) = 11.95; P = 0.002), and general fatigue (F(1,26) = 13.88; P = 0.001).  Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) has alleviated fatigue and improved QOL of cancer patients; however, little is known about the effects of nurse-led CBT on breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training.

Isn't pseudouridine a RNA modification?,no,Pseudouridine (Ψ) is the most abundant of>150 nucleoside modifications in RNA.  The number and position of the pseudouridines of Haloarcula marismortui and Deinococcus radiodurans large subunit RNA have been determined by a combination of total nucleoside analysis by HPLC-mass spectrometry and pseudouridine sequencing by the reverse transcriptase method and by LC/MS/MS. Pseudouridine is the most abundant of more than 100 chemically distinct natural ribonucleotide modifications.
Does a linker histone exist in the yeast genome?,yes,"Hho1p is a bona fide linker histone In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, HHO1 encodes a putative linker histone with very significant homology to histone H1 HHO1p may play a similar role to linker histones, but at restricted locations in the chromatin The putative linker histone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hho1p, has two regions of sequence (GI and GII) that are homologous to the single globular domains of linker histones H1 and H5 in higher eukaryotes.  The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of the linker histone H1, Hho1p, has two domains that are similar in sequence to the globular domain of H1 (and variants such as H5) Two homologous domains of similar structure but different stability in the yeast linker histone, Hho1p Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single linker histone, Hho1p, with two globular domains.  The Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p, with two globular domains, can simultaneously bind to two four-way junction DNA molecules Here, we show in yeast, that the presence of yeast linker histone Hho1p represses expression of a pol II transcribed gene (MET15) embedded in the rDNA. Yeast linker histone Hho1p is required for efficient RNA polymerase I processivity and transcriptional silencing at the ribosomal DNA Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p is not essential for cell viability, and very little is known about its function in vivo.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p functionally interacts with core histone H4 and negatively regulates the establishment of transcriptionally silent chromatin  Unlike canonical linker histones in higher eukaryotes that have a single conserved globular domain, Hho1p possesses two globular domains. We show that the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of Hho1p is dispensable for its function, suggesting that the mode of Hho1p action is similar to that of canonical linker histones To identify new proteins involved in spore nuclear organization, we purified chromatin from mature spores and discovered a significant enrichment of the linker histone (Hho1) Hho1 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed increased genome-wide binding in mature spores and provides novel in vivo evidence of the linker histone binding to nucleosomal linker DNA One of the peculiarities of S. cerevisiae cells is the unusual and less abundant linker histone, Hho1p. Hho1p, the linker histone of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is important for the proper chromatin organization in vivo Characteristically, linker histone depleted chromatin generally exhibited longer chromatin loops than the wild-type.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone-Hho1p maintains chromatin loop organization during ageing. Database homology searching against the complete yeast genome has identified a gene, HHO1, (or YPL127C, formerly LPI17) which encodes a protein that has two regions that show similarity to the pea histone H1 globular domain.

Isn't single-cell analysis (SCA) possible in proteomics?,yes,"Toward Single Cell Analysis by Plume Collimation in Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry. he advent of proteomics and genomics at a single-cell level has set the basis for an outstanding improvement in analytical technology and data acquisition. The new-generation technology of single-cell analysis is able to better characterize a cell's population, identifying and differentiating outlier cells, in order to provide both a single-cell experiment and a corresponding bulk measurement, through the identification, quantification and characterization of all system biology aspects (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, degradomics and fluxomics). The movement of omics into single-cell analysis represents a significant and outstanding shift. Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) is a novel method for the direct imaging of biological tissues by mass spectrometry. By performing ionization in the ambient environment, this technique enables in vivo studies with potential for single-cell analysis. Other approaches for MS-based chemical imaging and profiling include those based on near-field laser ablation and inductively-coupled plasma MS analysis, which offer complementary capabilities for subcellular chemical imaging and profiling. Mass spectrometry imaging and profiling of single cells. his is rapidly changing with the recent examples of single cell genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. The rate of change is expected to accelerate owing to emerging technologies that range from micro/nanofluidics to microfabricated interfaces for mass spectrometry to third- and fourth-generation automated DNA sequencers Single-cell analysis (SCA) has been increasingly recognized as the key technology for the elucidation of cellular functions, which are not accessible from bulk measurements on the population level. Thus far, SCA has been achieved by miniaturization of established engineering concepts to match the dimensions of a single cell Single-cell proteomic chip for profiling intracellular signaling pathways in single tumor cells. The amount of single proteins in single cells can be as low as one copy per cell and is for most proteins in the attomole range or below; usually considered as insufficient for proteomic analysis. n Arabidopsis thaliana, we have successfully identified nine unique proteins in a single-cell sample and 56 proteins from a pool of 15 single-cell samples from glucosinolate-rich S-cells by nanoLC-MS/MS proteomic analysis, thus establishing the proof-of-concept for true single-cell proteomic analysis A first step towards practical single cell proteomics: a microfluidic antibody capture chip with TIRF detection."
Is there an increased risk for cancer in Dyskeratosis Congenita?,yes,"People with DC are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis Clinical progression of the disease can lead to aplastic anemia (86% of all patients) and to pulmonary or hepatic complications. These patients also have an increased risk of cancer. Fanconi anaemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) comprise major inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). Adverse events include severe bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and solid tumours (ST) Patients with FA had earlier onset of cancers, need for stem cell transplant, and death; followed by DC; DBA and SDS were mildest. While FA and DC patients had markedly increased risks of cancer, AML and MDS, there were no cases of leukaemia in DBA or SDS patients The findings demonstrate that both FA and DC are major cancer susceptibility syndromes People with DC are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis Patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) have an increased risk of cancer, but also exhibit heightened radiation sensitivity. Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is characterized by the clinical triad of reticular skin pigmentation, oral leukoplakia, and nail dystrophy associated with bone marrow failure (BMF) and an high risk to develop cancer and pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare condition; however, it is vital to recognise the increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers in these patients. Point mutations in the DKC1 gene that encodes dyskerin cause the rare inherited syndrome called X-linked dyskeratosis congenita, characterized by a failure of proliferating tissues and increased susceptibility to cancer. Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) also known as Zinsser-Engman-Cole syndrome is a rare multi-system bone marrow failure syndrome characterised by mucocutaneous abnormalities and an increased predisposition to cancer"". Dyskeratosis congenita is an inherited syndrome characterised by mucocutaneous features, bone marrow failure, an increased risk of malignancy and other somatic abnormalities. Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare condition; however, it is vital to recognise the increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers in these patients. Epidermal atrophy, hair growth defects, bone marrow failure and increased risk of cancer are also common in DC patients.

Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Intraparticipant dose escalation was feasible, but dasatinib was ineffective in recurrent GBM.  Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.35 months (95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.4) and 6-month PFS was 7.7%. In this phase I study of recurrent glioblastoma patients, the combination of CCNU and dasatinib showed significant hematological toxicities and led to suboptimal exposure to both agents. Dasatinib in conjunction with bevacizumab does not appear to have activity in patients with recurrent, heavily pretreated GBM."
Isn't osteocrin expressed exclusively in the bone?,yes,"Evolution of Osteocrin as an activity-regulated factor in the primate brain. Here we use transcriptional profiling of human fetal brain cultures to identify an activity-dependent secreted factor, Osteocrin (OSTN), that is induced by membrane depolarization of human but not mouse neurons. Osteocrin (Ostn) is a recently discovered secreted protein produced by cells of the osteoblast lineage that shows a well conserved homology with members of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family.  Osteocrin (Ostn), a bone-active molecule, has been shown in animals to be highly expressed in cells of the osteoblast lineage.  Osteocrin, a novel bone-specific secreted protein that modulates the osteoblast phenotype."
Isn't a mutation of the ZIKV's membrane protein prM responsible for the microcephaly in new-born infants?,no,"Here we show that a single serine-to-asparagine substitution [Ser139→Asn139(S139N)] in the viral polyprotein substantially increased ZIKV infectivity in both human and mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and led to more severe microcephaly in the mouse fetus, as well as higher mortality rates in neonatal mice. A single mutation in the prM protein of Zika virus contributes to fetal microcephaly."
Aren't there randomised controlled trials on sevoflurane?,no,"After Ethics Review Board approval, 44 ASA I-III patients undergoing elective gynaecological surgery were randomised after surgery to either hypercapnic hyperpnoea or control groups. Hypercapnic hyperpnoea in spontaneously breathing patients halves the time of recovery from sevoflurane-induced anaesthesia in the operating room. A total of 200 women undergoing first trimester abortion (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) participated in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either sevoflurane or propofol for short-term sedation. The results showed the incidence of dreaming was significantly different between anaesthesia groups with 60% (60/100) of the sevoflurane group and 33% (33/100) of the propofol group (P=0.000) Anaesthesia administered had no effect on patient satisfaction. The results suggest that the incidence of dreaming was not affected by recovery time. Patient satisfaction was not influenced by choice of sedative and/or by the occurrence of dreaming during sevoflurane or propofol short-term sedation. Prior reports suggest that dreaming during anaesthesia is dependent on recovery time. Dreaming during sedation may impact patient satisfaction Sevoflurane vs. propofol in patients with coronary disease undergoing mitral surgery: a randomised study. We therefore performed a randomised controlled trial (sevoflurane vs. propofol) to compare cardiac troponin release in patients with coronary disease undergoing mitral surgery. Myocardial injury in remifentanil-based anaesthesia for off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery: an equipotent dose of sevoflurane versus propofol This randomised controlled trial compared the effect of equipotent anaesthetic doses of sevoflurane (S group) versus propofol (P group), during remifentanil-based anaesthesia for off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, on myocardial injury. Either sevoflurane or propofol was titrated to maintain bispectral index values between 40 and 50. This randomised, multicentre, parallel-group trial included 98 adult patients. Patients received intravenous propofol for induction followed by sevoflurane maintenance anaesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated to receive sugammadex 2.0 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 microg We compared the haemodynamics, emergence and recovery characteristics of total intravenous anaesthesia using propofol/remifentanil with sevoflurane/remifentanil anaesthesia, under bispectral index guidance, in 103 patients undergoing surgical procedures lasting > 3.5 h A randomised controlled trial of paediatric conscious sedation for dental treatment using intravenous midazolam combined with inhaled nitrous oxide or nitrous oxide/sevoflurane Intravenous midazolam, especially in combination with inhaled nitrous oxide or sevoflurane and nitrous oxide, are effective techniques, with the combination of midazolam and sevoflurane the one most likely to result in successful treatment. We randomly assigned 1063 adult and 322 paediatric elective patients to one of four (adult) or two (paediatric) anaesthesia groups In both studies, there was no difference in postdischarge outcomes at Day 7. Sevoflurane/sevoflurane was more costly with higher PONV rates in both studies. In adults, the cost per extra episode of PONV avoided was pound 296 (propofol/propofol vs. propofol/ sevoflurane) and pound 333 (propofol/sevoflurane vs. propofol/isoflurane). Comparison of sevoflurane and nitrous oxide mixture with nitrous oxide alone for inhalation conscious sedation in children having dental treatment: a randomised controlled trial. We studied 411 children aged 3-10 years who were referred for dental treatment.

Is there a relationship between B cells and Multiple Sclerosis?,yes,"These results suggest that RRMS patients with radiological phenotypes showing high neurodegeneration have changes in B cells characterized by down-regulation of B-cell-specific genes and increased activation status Although the exact etiology is still obscure, the leading hypothesis behind MS relapses is acute inflammatory attacks on CNS myelin and axons. This complex process involves B and T cells together with macrophages and microglia. It is currently known that CD24 serves as a costimulatory factor of T cells that regulate their homeostasis and proliferation, while in B cells, CD24 is functionally involved in cell activation and differentiation. CD24 can enhance autoimmune diseases in terms of its protective role in the clonal deletion of autoreactive thymocytes Multiple B cell-dependent mechanisms contributing to inflammatory demyelination of the CNS have been explored using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4 T cell-dependent animal model for multiple sclerosis.  The role of B cells in multiple sclerosis: rationale for B-cell-targeted therapies. Interest in CD8+ T cells and B cells was initially inspired by observations in multiple sclerosis rather than in animal models: CD8+ T cells predominate in multiple sclerosis lesions, oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands in CSF have long been recognised as diagnostic and prognostic markers, and anti-B-cell therapies showed considerable efficacy in multiple sclerosis. Differential effects of fingolimod on B-cell populations in multiple sclerosis. Unaltered regulatory B-cell frequency and function in patients with multiple sclerosis. B cells are increasingly recognized as major players in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. These observations underscore the B cell's contribution to the putative underpinnings of multiple sclerosis. Data suggesting that B cells play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis have been accumulating for the past five decades, demonstrating that the cerebrospinal fluid and central nervous system tissues of multiple sclerosis patients contain B cells, plasma cells, antibodies, and immunoglobulins. B-cell-targeted treatment for multiple sclerosis: mechanism of action and clinical data. Subset composition and cytokine production of B cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multiple sclerosis patients under Fingolimod treatment, untreated multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls were analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA. In particular, antigen presentation between B cells and T cells, increased trafficking of B cells across the blood-brain barrier, and autoantibodies produced by plasma cells may contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Accumulating evidence supports a major role of B cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathology of B cells and their role in central nervous system autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Targeting B cells in the treatment of multiple sclerosis: recent advances and remaining challenges phingosine-1-phosphate receptors control B-cell migration through signaling components associated with primary immunodeficiencies, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple sclerosis"
Isn't Downs syndrome associated with decreased risk of leukemia?,yes,The association of Down's syndrome and leukemia has been documented for over 50 years. Multiple studies have established the incidence of leukemia in Down's syndrome patients to be 10- to 20-fold higher than that in the general population. We present a case of congenital acute myeloid leukemia manifesting from the very first day of birth. Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was suspected by the presence of blasts in the peripheral blood smear and was confirmed on bone marrow by flowcytometry. Karyotyping revealed Trisomy 21. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and a solitary cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Downs syndrome.  This was thus confirmed to be a case with transient leukemia with Downs syndrome.
Is the Wnt protein modified by notum?,yes,Notum deacylates Wnt proteins to suppress signalling activity. Kinetic and mass spectrometric analyses of human proteins show that Notum is a carboxylesterase that removes an essential palmitoleate moiety from Wnt proteins and thus constitutes the first known extracellular protein deacylase. the Wnt inhibitor notum the WNT-inhibitor notum.
Isn't lenvatinib effective for renal cell carcinoma?,no,"However, the combination of lenvatinib, a multitargeted agent that inhibits VEGF as well as FGF receptors, and everolimus demonstrated promising results in a randomized phase II trial.  The FDA has approved the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus to treat advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Moreover, a recent Phase II study demonstrated a significant benefit for the second-line combination treatment with everolimus plus lenvatinib (a novel TKI) in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival compared to the single-agent everolimus. We then discuss two recently approved growth factor receptor antagonists i.e. cabozantinib and lenvatinib, and a recently approved checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, and issues pertaining to drug development, and future directions in treatment of metastatic RCC.  INTERPRETATION: Lenvatinib plus everolimus and lenvatinib alone resulted in a progression-free survival benefit for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have progressed after one previous VEGF-targeted therapy.  Lenvatinib therapy for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Lenvatinib therapy for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma."
Aren't osteoclasts specialized in bone degradation?,no,"osteoclast-mediated attack on bone Bone degradation is caused by osteoclasts, the normal bone-resorbing cells.  Cathepsin K is a highly potent collagenase in osteoclasts and is responsible for bone degradation. In osteoclasts, Src controls podosome organization and bone degradation, which leads to an osteopetrotic phenotype in src(-/-) mice Bone degradation by osteoclasts depends on the formation of a sealing zone, composed of an interlinked network of podosomes, which delimits the degradation lacuna into which osteoclasts secrete acid and proteolytic enzymes."
Do DNA double-strand breaks play a causal role in carcinogenesis?,yes,"The DNA non-homologous end-joining repair gene XRCC6/Ku70 plays an important role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by both exogenous and endogenous DNA-damaging agents. Defects in overall DSB repair capacity can lead to genomic instability and carcinogenesis. The tumor suppressor breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) protects our cells from genomic instability in part by facilitating the efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). BRCA1 promotes the error-free repair of DSBs through homologous recombination and is also implicated in the regulation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair fidelity. The increased frequency of DSB mutagenesis and MMEJ repair in the absence of BRCA1 suggests a potential mechanism for carcinogenesis. Comet assay under neutral conditions allows detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which has consequence to genome instability and carcinogenesis. Loss of p15/Ink4b accompanies tumorigenesis triggered by complex DNA double-strand breaks. Although DSBs are potentially carcinogenic, it is not clear whether complex DSBs that are refractory to repair are more potently tumorigenic compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly repaired, correctly or incorrectly, by mammalian cells. Zinc chromate induces chromosome instability and DNA double strand breaks in human lung cells. Our study shows that zinc chromate induced concentration-dependent increases in cytotoxicity, chromosome damage and DNA double strand breaks in human lung cells. Foci formation of P53-binding protein 1 in thyroid tumors: activation of genomic instability during thyroid carcinogenesis. Nitric oxide and acid induce double-strand DNA breaks in Barrett's esophagus carcinogenesis via distinct mechanisms. DNA double-strand break repair capacity and risk of breast cancer. A tumorigenic role of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been suggested by our finding of a significant association between increased breast cancer risk and a cooperative effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NHEJ genes. Carcinogen-induced DNA double strand break repair in sporadic breast cancer. Induction of DNA double strand breaks and alterations in the repair of these breaks is implicated in breast carcinogenesis. Prior studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from breast cancer patients exhibit increased numbers of DNA strand breaks after exposure to ionizing radiation, but these studies did not specifically measure DNA double strand breaks and it is not known whether chemical carcinogens produce similar effects. Abnormal DNA end-joining activity in human head and neck cancer. In human cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired primarily by the DNA end-joining (EJ) process and thus, abnormal DNA EJ activities lead to an accumulation of mutations and/or aneuploidy, resulting in genetic instability of cells. Since genetic instability is the hallmark of cancer cells, we studied the DNA EJ activities of normal, non-malignant immortalized and malignant human epithelial cells to investigate the association between DNA EJ and carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Recent research has shown that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer. In order to study the role of DNA damage processing in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we assessed the ability of six keratinocyte cell lines from a multistage-tumor progression model to repair three types of DNA damage: pyrimidine dimers, oxidative DNA lesions and DNA double strand breaks (DSB). However, an acquired deficiency in repairing DNA double strand breaks can be one mechanism promoting progression towards malignancy, possibly through impairing chromosomal stability. Recent findings demonstrate that accelerated carcinogenesis following liver regeneration is associated with chronic inflammation-induced double-strand DNA breaks in cells, which escaped apoptosis due to proliferative stress. Although DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis may relate to arsenite-induced damage and carcinogenesis, the mechanism of action remains obscure."
Isn't there a role of regorafenib for sarcoma treatment?,no,"Regorafenib has been approved for third-line therapy. Study protocol of REGOSARC trial: activity and safety of regorafenib in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II trial. DISCUSSION: The design of this trial allows an assessment of regorafenib activity over placebo in four sarcoma strata and might provide evidence for launching a phase III trial. This case provides rationale for adding a Ewing sarcoma arm to SARC024, a phase II study of regorafenib, another multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, in patients with liposarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing and Ewing-like sarcomas (NCT02048371). Thus, the Phase III studies with pazopanib, regorafenib, muramyl tripeptide (MTP) and ridaforolimus are extensively discussed as well as the biological rationale for the use of these compounds. Currently, regorafenib is examined in several clinical trials (mostly phase II) in different tumor entities, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Analysis of primary human sarcoma samples revealed direct cytotoxicity following exposure to sorafenib and regorafenib with a corresponding increase in ALDHbright cells (P<0.05). Parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were performed as appropriate.RESULTS: After functionally validating the CSC phenotype of ALDHbright sarcoma cells, we observed that sorafenib and regorafenib were cytotoxic to sarcoma cell lines (P<0.05), with a corresponding 1.4 - 2.8 fold increase in ALDHbright cells from baseline (P<0.05). We evaluated survival and CSC phenotype in mice harboring sarcoma metastases after TKI therapy. We exposed dissociated primary sarcoma tumors to sorafenib, regorafenib, and pazopanib, and we used tissue microarray (TMA) and primary sarcoma samples to evaluate the frequency and intensity of CSC markers after neoadjuvant therapy with sorafenib and pazopanib.

Isn't LDB1-mediated enhancer looping dependent on cohesin?,yes,"LDB1-mediated enhancer looping can be established independent of mediator and cohesin. Moreover, ENCODE data and our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted LDB1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs. Thus, lineage specific factors largely mediate enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and cohesin.

Is enzastaurin effective treatment of glioblastoma?,no,"RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056).  Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: PFS-6 missed the primary planned outcome of 55%.  OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide plus RT.  More recently, antiangiogenic agents including enzastaurin, cediranib, bevacizumab, and others that target mainly the VEGF pathway, have been evaluated in this highly angiogenic disease. Among them, only bevacizumab has been associated with clear anti-tumor activity, although the lack of control studies limits the impact of the results to date. Enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy. Several signal transduction inhibitors have been examined in preclinical and clinical malignant glioma trials, including antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, enzastaurin), and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus, everolimus) and integrin (cilengitide). Although preliminary clinical results of the use of targeted agents have not translated into significantly better survival, more recent phase II trials are exploring the combination of multitargeted drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to overcome the resistance of tumors to single-agent targeted therapies. Several drugs have been tested, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin). Although preliminary efficacy results of most trials in recurrent disease have fallen short on expectations, substantial advances have been achieved by associated translational research.  So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease."
Isn't there any software for automated analysis of FISH images?,no,"he study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH signal analysis that applying a CAD scheme to the automated generated 2-D projection images. A color imaging technique, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization (M-FISH), has been developed to ease the analysis of the process. Using an M-FISH technique each chromosome class (1,2, …,22,X,Y) is stained with a unique color. However, significant variations between images are observed due to a number of factors such as uneven hybridization and spectral overlap among channels. These types of variations influence the pixel classification accuracy of image classification methods which are supervised and require a set of annotated images for training. In this paper, we present a fully unsupervised M-FISH chromosome image classification methodology. Our main contributions are 1) the assumption that the intensity of a chromosome pixel is sampled from multiple Gaussian components [Gaussian mixture model (GMM)] such that each component corresponds to one chromosome class, and 2) the initialization of the GMM model using the emission information of each chromosome class. This is feasible since prior to the M-FISH image acquirement, we already know which chromosome class is emitting to each of the five M-FISH image channels. The method has been tested on a large number of M-FISH images and an overall accuracy of 89.85% is reported. Our method is unsupervised and presents higher classification accuracy even when it is compared with common supervised based methods. hybridization (FISH) tests provide promising molecular imaging biomarkers to more accurately and reliably detect and diagnose cancers and genetic disorders. Since current manual FISH signal analysis is low-efficient and inconsistent, which limits its clinical utility, developing automated FISH image scanning systems and computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes has been attracting research interests. To acquire high-resolution FISH images in a multi-spectral scanning mode, a huge amount of image data with the stack of the multiple three-dimensional (3-D) image slices is generated from a single specimen. Automated preprocessing these scanned images to eliminate the non-useful and redundant data is important to make the automated FISH tests acceptable in clinical applications. In this study, a dual-detector fluorescence image scanning system was applied to scan four specimen slides with FISH-probed chromosome X. A CAD scheme was developed to detect analyzable interphase cells and map the multiple imaging slices recorded FISH-probed signals into the 2-D projection images. CAD scheme was then applied to each projection image to detect analyzable interphase cells using an adaptive multiple-threshold algorithm, identify FISH-probed signals using a top-hat transform, and compute the ratios between the normal and abnormal cells. To assess CAD performance, the FISH-probed signals were also independently visually detected by an observer. The Kappa coefficients for agreement between CAD and observer ranged from 0.69 to 1.0 in detecting/counting FISH signal spots in four testing samples.  In this paper we developed a sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithm based on L1-norm minimization for classifying chromosomes from multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) images. The algorithm has been tested on a comprehensive M-FISH database that we established, demonstrating improved performance in classification. When compared with other pixel-wise M-FISH image classifiers such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms and adaptive fuzzy c-means (AFCM) clustering algorithms that we proposed earlier the current method gave the lowest classification error. In order to evaluate the performance of different SRC for M-FISH imaging analysis, three different sparse representation methods, namely, Homotopy method, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and Least Angle Regression (LARS), were tested and compared. Results from our statistical analysis have shown that Homotopy based method is significantly better than the other two methods.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to study the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes. The simultaneous detection of protein expression and gene copy number changes in patient samples, like paraffin-embedded tissue sections, is challenging since the procedures of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) negatively influence each other which often results in suboptimal staining. Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy number changes within the same cell. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of colorectal cancers were stained for CD133 expression. IHC images were acquired and image coordinates recorded. Slides were subsequently hybridized with fluorescently labeled DNA probes. FISH images were taken at the previously recorded positions allowing for direct comparison of protein expression and gene copy number signals within the same cells/tissue areas. Relocation, acquisition of the IHC and FISH images, and enumeration of FISH signals in the immunophenotyped tumour areas were done in an automated fashion. RESULTS: Automated FISH analysis was performed on 13 different colon cancer samples that had been stained for CD133; each sample was scored for MYC, ZNF217 and Chromosome 6 in CD133 positive and negative glands. From the 13 cases four (31%) showed amplification for the MYC oncogene and seven of 13 (54%) cases were amplified for ZNF217.

Are Drosophila ultraconserved elements candidate ncRNAs?,yes,"Highly constrained intergenic Drosophila ultraconserved elements are candidate ncRNAs. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of UCEs from 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We identified 98 elements ≥80 bp long with very high conservation across the Drosophila phylogeny. Population genetic analyses reveal that these UCEs are not present in mutational cold spots. Instead we infer that they experience a level of selective constraint almost 10-fold higher compared with missense mutations in protein-coding sequences, which is substantially higher than that observed previously for human UCEs. About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures. Among ten chosen for further analysis, we discovered that the majority are transcribed in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.

Isn't the Snord116 cluster associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome?,no,"All three deletions included SNORD116, but only two encompassed parts of SNURF-SNRPN, implicating SNORD116 as the major contributor to the Prader-Willi phenotype. Our case adds further information about genotype-phenotype correlation and supports the hypothesis that SNORD116 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome These results demonstrate that the AS candidate drug topotecan acts predominantly through stabilizing R loops and chromatin decondensation at the paternally expressed PWS Snord116 locus. Our study holds promise for targeted therapies to the Snord116 locus for both AS and PWS. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of RNA expression from an imprinted region on chromosome 15 that includes SNRPN, SNORD115, and SNORD116.  Recently published data strongly suggest a role for the paternally expressed small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) cluster, SNORD116, in PWS etiology. Whereas loss of function of the SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS, the role of the other genes is less clear.  Recent data suggest that snoRNA Snord116 is important for the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) characterized by hyperphagia and obesity. The current study was conducted to assess a potential cellular link between Snord116 and phenotypes of PWS.  The imprinted Snurf-Snrpn chromosomal domain contains two large arrays of tandemly repeated, paternally expressed box C/D small-nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes: the SNORD115 (H/MBII-52) and SNORD116 (H/MBII-85) gene clusters believed to play key roles in the fine-tuning of serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) pre-mRNA processing and in the etiology of the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), respectively There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, absence of a small nucleolar organizing RNA gene, SNORD116, seems to reproduce many of the clinical features. Both kits should be made available for accurate characterization of PWS/AS deletion subtypes as well as evaluating for IC and SNORD116 microdeletions. There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, absence of a small nucleolar organizing RNA gene, SNORD116, seems to reproduce many of the clinical features.  Although the SNORD116 gene cluster has become a prime candidate for PWS, it cannot be excluded that other paternally expressed genes in the chromosomal region 15q11q13 contribute to the full phenotype. In addition, recently published data provide strong evidence in support of a role for the snoRNA SNORD116 cluster (HBII-85) in PWS etiology. Identification and characterization of this case provide unequivocal evidence for a critical role for the SNORD116 snoRNA molecules in PWS pathogenesis."
Isn't there any link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates?,no,"Some of the most highly conserved sequences occur in genes encoding RNA binding proteins, particularly the RNA splicing-associated SR genes. Differences in sequence conservation between plants and animals are likely to reflect differences in the biology of the organisms, with plants being much more able to tolerate genomic deletions and whole-genome duplication events due, in part, to their far greater fecundity compared with vertebrates."
Isn't Achondroplasia associated with hearing loss?,no,"A hearing screening program was performed to determine the prevalence of hearing loss and abnormal tympanometry in individuals with short-stature skeletal dysplasias attending a national meeting. Behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic emission testing, and tympanometry were used to assess hearing. Failed hearing screen was defined as hearing ≥ 35 dB at one or more frequencies or by ""fail"" on otoacoustic emissions. One hundred ten of 112 subjects completed the screening. 58 (51.8%) were children. Seventy-three (65.2%) had achondroplasia, 34 (30.4%) had one of 11 other diagnoses, and 5(4.4%) were undiagnosed. 25.8% of children failed hearing screening in one or both ears, while 46.3% of adults failed in one or both ears. 55.1% of adults and 25.0% of children with achondroplasia failed screening. Forty-four children had achondroplasia, and 31 had normal hearing in both ears (71%); 8 failed hearing screening in 1 ear (18%), and 3 in both ears (7%). Tympanometry was performed in 45 children, with normal tympanograms found in 21 (47%), bilateral abnormal tympanograms in 15 (33%), and unilateral abnormal tympanograms in 9 (20%). Fourteen children with achondroplasia had normal tympanograms (42%); 11 had bilateral abnormal tympanograms (33%); and 8 had unilateral abnormal tympanograms (24%). For those children without functioning tympanostomy tubes, there was a 9.5 times greater odds of hearing loss if there was abnormal tympanometry (P = .03). Achondroplasia (MIM 100800) is the most common non-lethal skeletal dysplasia. Its incidence is between one in 10,000 and one in 30,000. The phenotype is characterized by rhizomelic disproportionate short stature, enlarged head, midface hypoplasia, short hands and lordotic lumbar spine, associated with normal cognitive development. This autosomal-dominant disorder is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the type 3 receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGFR3); in more than 95% of cases, the mutation is G380R. The diagnosis is suspected on physical examination and confirmed by different age-related radiological features. Anticipatory and management care by a multidisciplinary team will prevent and treat complications, including cervical cord compression, conductive hearing loss and thoracolumbar gibbosity. The report includes information on otitis media, ventilation tubes, hearing loss, tonsillectomy, speech problems, tibial bowing and osteotomy, ventricular shunting, apnoea, cervicomedullary decompression, and neurological signs attributable to spinal stenosis. We conclude that verbal comprehension is significantly impaired in children with achondroplasia. This partial deficiency is probably related to frequent middle ear infections and resulting conductive hearing loss. In order to determine whether these morphologic changes are the cause of the hearing deficit in achondroplasia, audiometric studies and ENT evaluation were performed in eight of the nine patients. Audiograms were obtained in six of the nine achondroplastic subjects (two adults and four children). There was evidence of mixed hearing loss in the four children, but only of sensorineural hearing loss in the adults. We believe that the persistent hearing loss in achondroplasia is not due to sequelae of otitis media as some authors have suggested.  The AA report a clinical and radiological study performed in 18 achondroplastic patients in order to achieve a nosological settlement of the otological impairments."
Is Prochlorococcus the most abundant photosynthetic organism?,yes,"The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the smallest and most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the numerically dominant photosynthetic organism in the oligotrophic oceans, and a model system in marine microbial ecology.

The oceanic picoplankton Prochlorococcus - probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on our planet - can grow at great depths where light intensity is very low."
Aren't transcription and splicing connected?,no,", as splicing is often cotranscriptional, a complex picture emerges in which splicing regulation not only depends on the balance of splicing factor binding to their pre-mRNA target sites but also on transcription-associated features such as protein recruitment to the transcribing machinery and elongation kinetics. recent evidence shows that chromatin structure is another layer of regulation that may act through various mechanisms hese span from regulation of RNA polymerase II elongation, which ultimately determines splicing decisions, to splicing factor recruitment by specific histone marks. Chromatin may not only be involved in alternative splicing regulation but in constitutive exon recognition as well Moreover, splicing was found to be necessary for the proper 'writing' of particular chromatin signatures, giving further mechanistic support to functional interconnections between splicing, transcription and chromatin structure. These links between chromatin configuration and splicing raise the intriguing possibility of the existence of a memory for splicing patterns to be inherited through epigenetic modifications. Spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally, raising the possibility that DNA structure may directly influence alternative splicing. upporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. ere we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide We recently showed that cotranscriptional splicing occurs efficiently in Drosophila, In recent years it became apparent that splicing is predominantly cotranscriptional To determine the prevalence of cotranscriptional splicing in Drosophila, we sequenced nascent RNA transcripts from Drosophila S2 cells as well as from Drosophila heads. Eighty-seven percent of the introns assayed manifest >50% cotranscriptional splicing. The remaining 13% are cotranscriptionally spliced poorly or slowly, with ∼3% being almost completely retained in nascent pre-mRNA. We estimate that > or =90% of endogenous yeast splicing is posttranscriptional, consistent with an analysis of posttranscriptional snRNP-associated pre-mRNA. Notably, the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, which stalls elongating Pol II, increased cotranscriptional splicing factor accumulation and splicing in parallel. This provides direct evidence for a kinetic link between transcription, splicing factor recruitment and splicing catalysis. Recent evidence indicates that transcriptional elongation and splicing can be influenced reciprocally: Elongation rates control alternative splicing and splicing factors can, in turn, modulate pol II elongation. The presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and the existence of proteins, such as the coactivator PGC-1, with dual activities in splicing and transcription can explain the links between both processes and add a new level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes."
Isn't creatinine assessment included in the MELD score?,no,"Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores were calculated as 3.78×ln[TB] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 9.57×ln[creatinine] + 6.43.  A corrected creatinine was derived from the mGFR after application of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Subsequently, a corrected MELD was calculated and compared with the conventionally calculated MELD. Among patients with MELD score>35, a new prognostic model based on serum creatinine, need for hemodialysis and moderate ascites could identify the sickest one. Patient risk factors evaluated include age, INR (international normalized ratio), creatinine, bilirubin, and MELD score (Model for End-of-stage Liver Disease).  Limited comparability of creatinine assays in patients with liver cirrhosis and their impact on the MELD score. The model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is used for this purpose in most countries and incorporates bilirubin, International Normalized ratio, and creatinine.  The MELD score was calculated using international normalized ratio, serum billirubin and creatinine. Regression analysis identified high creatinine and INR, but not bilirubin, as the MELD components predicting negative outcomes with ELAD.  This study aimed to evaluate the impact of two creatinine measurement methods on the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and glomerular filtration rate estimation (eGFR) in cirrhotic patients. <b>OBJECTIVES</b>: The model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD = 3.8*LN[total bilirubin] + 9.6*LN[creatinine] + 11.2*[PT-INR] + 6.4) predicts mortality for tricuspid valve surgery. Simplified MELD score = 3.8*LN[total bilirubin] + 9.6*LN[creatinine] + 6.4.<br><b>METHODS</b>: A total of 172 patients (male: 66, female: 106; mean age, 63.8 ± 10.3 years) who underwent tricuspid replacement (n = 18) or repair (n = 154) from January 1991 to July 2011 at a single centre were included. CONCLUSION Incorporating eGFR obtained by the 6-variable MDRD equation into the MELD score showed an equal predictive performance in in-hospital mortality compared to a creatinine-based MELD score. Simplified MELD score = 3.8*LN[total bilirubin] + 9.6*LN[creatinine] + 6.4."
Hasn't protein citrullination been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis?,no,": Citrullination has become a hot topic within recent years due to its involvement in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis and fibrosis.  Current literature suggests that increased levels of citrullinated proteins are found in several if not all inflammatory diseases.  Antibodies directed against citrullinated proteins and peptides (ACPAs) are the most specific serological markers available for diagnosing RA.  Citrullination of proteins is well described in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and hypercitrullination of proteins may be related to inflammation in general.  Some ACPA are remarkably effective as diagnostics in autoimmune disorders, most notably rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several ACPA can be observed before other clinical RA manifestations are apparent.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein/peptide autoantibodies (ACPAs).  Anti-citrullinated peptides as autoantigens in rheumatoid arthritis-relevance to treatment. The implications of citrullination affecting integrin binding in disease open up a new area of study and might have implications for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. In this paper, we will review the three of the main classes of PTMs already associated with RA: citrullination, carbamylation, and oxidation. Citrullinated collagen II (CII) is a well-known autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Among the RA-associated autoantibodies, especially anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have been studied intensively in the last decade. Protein citrullination is a posttranslational modification that has attracted increased attention, especially for its involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Identification of citrullinated cellular fibronectin in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Cellular fibronectin (cFn) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and we previously demonstrated the presence of citrullinated cFn in rheumatoid synovial tissues.  . In rheumatoid arthritis, PAD4 and protein citrullination are increased in inflamed joints, and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) form against citrullinated antigens are formed."

Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal aneuploidies using massively parallel sequencing-by-ligation and evidence that cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal plasma originates from cytotrophoblastic cells. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma has been developed for the detection of fetal aneuploidy. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma is a novel approach, designed for detecting common aneuploidies in the fetus. non-invasive prenatal tests for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has been hailed as a revolution in prenatal testing and has triggered significant commercial interest in the field.

RAPIDR (Reliable Accurate Prenatal non-Invasive Diagnosis R package) is an easy-to-use open-source R package that implements several published NIPT analysis methods. The clinical data collected thus far indicate that NIPT is highly sensitive in detecting trisomies 21 and 18, and fairly sensitive in detecting trisomy 13 and sex chromosome aneuploidies. Because false-positive results may occur, an abnormal result must be validated by invasive prenatal testing. When non-invasive prenatal screening for aneuploidy is available, maternal age alone should not be an indication for invasive prenatal diagnosis in a twin pregnancy. (II-2A) If non-invasive prenatal screening is not available, invasive prenatal diagnosis in twins should be offered to women aged 35 and over. Therefore, methods with high sensitivity and precision are required to detect and differentiate fetal DNA from the large background of maternal DNA.

Isn't protein M3/6 a dual specificity phosphatase?,no,"Involvement of the dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 in c-Jun N-terminal kinase inactivation following cerebral ischemia in the rat hippocampus. The results revealed upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) activity at 4 h of reperfusion in rat hippocampi.  This study examines the molecular mechanism underlying JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation evoked by dual-specificity phosphates following cerebral ischemia. Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins.  Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8].  Here we describe two new dual specificity phosphatases of the CL100/MKP-1 family that are selective for inactivating ERK or JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases when expressed in COS-7 cells. M3/6 is the first phosphatase of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases.  We previously demonstrated that the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) MKP7 and M3/6 bind the scaffold JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) and inactivate the bound subset of JNK (1). the dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6  dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK  the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK The dual specificity phosphatases M3/6 and MKP-3 are highly selective for inactivation of distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases. Phosphorylation of the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase enhances the activation of JNK by arsenite. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Regulation of dual-specificity phosphatases M3/6 and hVH5 by phorbol esters.

Is amoxicillin used for treatment of malnutrition in children?,yes,"Another RCT did not show superiority of ceftriaxone over amoxicilllin for these same outcomes, but adressed SAM children with and without complications (p = 0.27). Another RCT showed no difference between amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole efficacies for pneumonia in underweight, but not SAM. Our meta-analysis of 12 pooled susceptibility-studies for all types of bacterial isolates, including 2767 stricly SAM children, favoured amoxicillin over cotrimoxazole for susceptibility medians: 42% (IQR 27-55%) vs 22% (IQR 17-23%) and population-weighted-means 52.9% (range 23-57%) vs 35.4% (range 6.7-42%).  Susceptibility-studies favour amoxicillin over cotrimoxazole.  Oral amoxicillin for 5 days was as effective as intramuscular ceftriaxone for 2 days (1 RCT). For uncomplicated SAM, amoxicillin showed no benefit over placebo (1 retrospective study).  Children who took amoxicillin and de-worming had 95% (HR = 1.95, 95%-CI = 1.17, 3.23) and 74% (HR = 1.74, 95%-CI = 1.07, 2.83) more probability to recover from SAM as compared to those who didn't take them. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned Malawian children, 6 to 59 months of age, with severe acute malnutrition to receive amoxicillin, cefdinir, or placebo for 7 days in addition to ready-to-use therapeutic food for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition.  In the amoxicillin, cefdinir, and placebo groups, 88.7%, 90.9%, and 85.1% of the children recovered, respectively (relative risk of treatment failure with placebo vs. amoxicillin, 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.68; relative risk with placebo vs. cefdinir, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.11). The mortality rates for the three groups were 4.8%, 4.1%, and 7.4%, respectively (relative risk of death with placebo vs. amoxicillin, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.24; relative risk with placebo vs. cefdinir, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.64). Evaluation of the routine use of amoxicillin as part of the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the inclusion of amoxicillin correlates with better recovery rates in the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition with ready-to-use therapeutic food. The standard protocol group received a 7-day course of amoxicillin at the onset of treatment. RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-eight children were treated according to the standard protocol with amoxicillin, and 1955 were treated under the alternate protocol without antibiotics.  The recovery rate for children who received amoxicillin was worse at 4 weeks (40%vs. 71%) but similar after up to 12 weeks of therapy (84%vs. 86%), compared to the children treated without antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This review of two therapeutic feeding programmes suggests that children with severe acute malnutrition who were treated without amoxicillin did not have an inferior rate of recovery.

Evaluation of the routine use of amoxicillin as part of the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the inclusion of amoxicillin correlates with better recovery rates in the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition with ready-to-use therapeutic food. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared data from the treatment of two groups of children in Malawi aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition.  The recovery rate for children who received amoxicillin was worse at 4 weeks (40%vs. 71%) but similar after up to 12 weeks of therapy (84%vs. 86%), compared to the children treated without antibiotics. Regression modelling indicated that this difference at 4 weeks was most strongly associated with the receipt of amoxicillin.

Isn't muscle regeneration possible in mdx mice with the use of induced mesenchymal stem cells?,no,"Purified iMSCs displayed fibroblast-like morphology, formed three-dimensional spheroid structures, and expressed characteristic mesenchymal stem cell surface markers such as CD29, CD33, CD73, CD90, and CD105. Moreover, iMSCs were capable of differentiating into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Transplanting iMSC cells to tibialis anterior skeletal muscle tissue in mdx mice lowered oxidative damage as evidenced by a reduction in nitrotyrosine levels, and normal dystrophin expression levels were restored This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of purified iMSCs in skeletal muscle regeneration in mdx mice Flk-1+ adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into skeletal muscle satellite cells and ameliorate muscular dystrophy in mdx mice Within mdx mice, an animal model of DMD, adipose tissue-derived Flk-1(+) MSCs (AD-MSCs) homed to and differentiated into cells that repaired injured muscle tissue. This repair correlated with reconstitution of dystrophin expression on the damaged fibers Flk-1(+) AD-MSC transplants may repair muscular dystrophy This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of purified iMSCs in skeletal muscle regeneration in mdx mice, and suggests that iPSCs are a viable alternate source for deriving MSCs as needed.

Hasn't vitamin D has been shown to reduce incidence of falls in older people in clinical trials?,no,"However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).  The rate of falls and the number of fallers was significantly reduced in two studies evaluating the effect of medication on preventing falls; one study (85 participants) compared vitamin D versus placebo in institutionalised women after stroke with low vitamin D levels, and the other study (79 participants) evaluated alendronate versus alphacalcidol in hospitalised people after stroke. Two studies testing vitamin D versus placebo and alendronate versus alphacalcidol found a significant reduction in falls and the number of people falling .Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; seven trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Vitamin D affects bone and muscle health and likely reduces the risk of falls in the elderly. We found 26 eligible trials of moderate quality that enrolled 45,782 participants, the majority of which were elderly and female. Vitamin D use was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls (odds ratio for suffering at least one fall, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.96) This effect was more prominent in patients who were vitamin D deficient at baseline and in studies in which calcium was coadministered with vitamin D. Vitamin D combined with calcium reduces the risk of falls. The majority of the evidence is derived from trials enrolling elderly women. Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. Despite significant increases in the provision of hip protectors and use of vitamin D supplementation in both intervention and control facilities, there was no difference in the number of falls or falls injuries between the intervention and control groups, nor a reduction in falls overall. Beyond fall and fracture prevention, vitamin D may also reduce overall morbidity by multiple mechanisms.  There is evidence to suggest that these agents may reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures and falls; however, their benefit on vertebral fracture reduction may depend on the type of active vitamin D."
Can RNAPolII function as an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase?,yes,"RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. . Our studies provide compelling evidence that mammalian Pol II acts as an RdRP to control the stability of a cellular RNA by extending its 3'-end. here is, however, evidence that Pol II also possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes. The present findings provide a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanistic principles of transcription by a viral RNA polymerase and have implications for the regulation of Pol II activities in infected cells. Influenza A virus transcribes its segmented negative sense RNA genome in the nuclei of infected cells in a process long known to require host RNA polymerase II (RNAP-II). We conclude that influenza A virus replication requires RNAP-II activity not just to provide capped mRNA substrates but also to facilitate nuclear export of selected viral mRNAs. Thus, influenza virus specifically interferes with Pol II elongation, but not Pol II initiation. We propose that influenza virus RNA polymerase, by binding to the CTD of initiating Pol II and subsequent cleavage of the capped 5' end of the nascent transcript, triggers premature Pol II termination. We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) preinitiation complex recruitment and H3 Lys 4 (H3-K4) methylation at the Xist promoter form the basis of the Xist expression profiles that drives both imprinted and random XCI. Identification of these ENL-associated proteins (EAPs) by mass spectrometry revealed enzymes with a known role in transcriptional elongation (RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [RNAPolII CTD] positive transcription elongation factor b [pTEFb]), and in chromatin modification (histone-H3 methyltransferase DOT1L) as well as other frequent MLL partners (AF4, AF5q31, and LAF4), and polycomb group members (RING1, CBX8, and BCoR). RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA. Association of the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with cellular RNA polymerase II. It is also well established that viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRNP) associates with cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II), on which viral replication depends.  RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Natural cellular RNA substrates of mammalian Pol II, however, have not been identified and the cellular function of the Pol II RdRP activity is unknown. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA."
Isn't ocrelizumab effective for treatment of multiple sclerosis?,no,"Advances made in immunomodulation are driving the progress being made in the treatment of MS. Ocrelizumab is the first treatment with positive results in the primarily progressive forms and tocilizumab, a drug product for rheumatoid arthritis, stands out as a potential candidate for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica.  Expert commentary: The recent encouraging results of the ocrelizumab trial in PP MS, the first to reach the primary disability endpoint, indicate B cells as a promising therapeutic target to prevent disease progression.  Ocrelizumab also shows efficacy in the primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Expert commentary: The topline results of two phase-III randomized clinical trials demonstrate superiority of ocrelizumab over interferon beta in RRMS patients with regards to clinical and paraclinical outcome parameters.  The efficacy of three of them, rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab in MS has been confirmed by placebo-controlled clinical trials demonstrating a significant reduction of the annualized relapsing rate (ARR), new gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) and T2 lesions.  Ongoing PMS trials are currently being conducted with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor ibudilast, S1P modulator siponimod and anti-B-cell therapy ocrelizumab.  RECENT FINDINGS: Novel and imminently emerging DMTs for the treatment of RRMS include alemtuzumab, daclizumab, ocrelizumab, pegylated interferon-β-1a, and three times weekly glatiramer acetate.  To summarize mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of novel and imminently emerging disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) intended to be used in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).Novel and imminently emerging DMTs for the treatment of RRMS include alemtuzumab, daclizumab, ocrelizumab, pegylated interferon-β-1a, and three times weekly glatiramer acetate Ocrelizumab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of two dose regimens of the humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  In multiple sclerosis (MS), B cell-depleting therapy using monoclonal anti-CD20 Abs, including rituximab (RTX) and ocrelizumab, effectively reduces disease activity.  Ocrelizumab also shows efficacy in the primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis.Most of the presented cell-depleting and myeloablative therapies are highly effective treatment options but are also accompanied by significant risks. The armamentarium of approved disease-modifying therapies in MS and those in development include: (1) the first approved, moderately effective, injectable interferon-β and glatiramer acetate; (2) oral drugs (fingolimod, laquinimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate); (3) monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, daclizumab, alemtuzumab); and (4) immunosuppressive agents (e.g. mitoxantrone). BACKGROUND: B lymphocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of two dose regimens of the humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 79 centres in 20 countries. Patients aged 18-55 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive either placebo, low-dose (600 mg) or high-dose (2000 mg) ocrelizumab in two doses on days 1 and 15, or intramuscular interferon beta-1a (30 ìg) once a week.

Doesn't administration of triiodothyronine improve outcome following coronary artery bypass grafting?,yes,"Serum T3 concentrations were significantly higher with fewer patients having T3 concentrations below the normal range in the T3 group than the placebo group throughout the postoperative period. Hemodynamic variables, postoperative inotrope requirement, and outcome variables showed no differences between the groups We conclude that although widespread interest has been shown on the use of thyroid hormones in the perioperative period, and the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid hormone metabolism widely studied, there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Treatment with GIK, T3, and GIK/T3 improves hemodynamic performance and results in reduced cTnI release in patients undergoing on-pump CABG surgery. Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Parenteral triiodothyronine given after crossclamp removal during elective coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improved postoperative ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was slightly decreased, and the need for postoperative pacemaker support was reduced. Perioperative T3 administration decreased the incidence and need for treatment of postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Intravenous T(3) does not have dramatic effects on hemodynamic variables in this setting as has been previously suggested.  Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy. No significant differences were noted in the pre and post CPB hemodynamics between the two groups for the most part of the study except that heart rate was increased in T3 group. The haemodynamic parameters were no different between the two groups at any postoperative time point. Likewise, density and affinity of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors were not significantly different from pre-operative values in either group."
Does metformin interfere thyroxine absorption?,no,LT4 absorption is unchanged by concomitant metformin ingestion. It has been hypothesized that metformin may suppress serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations by enhancing LT4 absorption or by directly affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
Are there any DNMT3 proteins present in plants?,yes,"De novo DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana is catalyzed by the methyltransferase DRM2, a homolog of the mammalian de novo methyltransferase DNMT3. Here we describe DNA methyltransferase genes from both Arabidopsis and maize that show a high level of sequence similarity to Dnmt3, suggesting that they encode plant de novo methyltransferases. Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity. The N termini of these methyltransferases contain a series of ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains.  BLASTX searches and phylogenetic analysis suggested that five cDNAs belonged to four classes (Dnmt1, Dnmt2, CMT and Dnmt3) of DNA methyltransferase genes."
Is Citrobacter rodentium pathogenic?,yes,"One day after colonization, mice were infected with the colonic pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. The human pathogen enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), as well as the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, colonize the gut mucosa via attaching and effacing lesion formation and cause diarrheal diseases. EPEC-like mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium Here, we develop a model that provides that link for the investigation of Citrobacter rodentium infection, a mouse model for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)."
Does the protein mTOR regulate autophagy?,yes,"autophagy is negatively regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin receptor (mTOR) Subjecting cells to starvation or rapamycin efficiently induces autophagy by inhibiting the MTOR signaling pathway triggering increased autophagic flux.  Several pathways, including mTOR, have been shown to regulate autophagy. these results provide insights into the mechanism by which hyperactivation of mTORC1 promotes breast cancer progression through increasing autophagy and Akt activation in vivo.  the canonical mTOR-controlled autophagy pathway mTOR inhibition severely impairs liver regeneration and increases autophagy after PH mTOR remains at a high level and inhibits autophagy.

Isn't celiac disease caused by gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events ?,no,"Celiac disease (CD) is a frequent inflammatory intestinal disease, with a genetic background, caused by gliadin-containing food.  Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy initiated and sustained by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. It is caused by a dysregulated immune response toward both dietary antigens, the gluten proteins of wheat, rye, and barley, and autoantigens, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2) Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the presence of anti-transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and anti-gliadin antibodies Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) catalyzes cross-linking or deamidation of glutamine residues in peptides and proteins. The in vivo deamidation of gliadin peptides plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides recognized by intestinal T cells from patients."
Aren't integrins part of the extracellular matrix?,no,"Several constituents of the ECM provide adhesive cues, which serve as binding sites for cell trans-membrane receptors, such as integrins. We also determined that blocking β1integrins, the major class of receptors for all ECM proteins tested, Here, we elucidate a cross-scale mechanism for tissue assembly and ECM remodeling involving Cadherin 2, the ECM protein Fibronectin, and its receptor Integrin α5.  due to the diverse functions and variable expression of proteoglycans, matrix proteins, and integrins, it is rather difficult to identify a comprehensive therapeutic target among ECM components. Integrin-dependent cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion is a determinant of spindle orientation. The extracellular matrix component periostin is a secreted protein that functions as both a cell attachment protein and an autocrine or paracrine factor that signals through the cell adhesion molecule integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5.  Integrin receptors connect the extracellular matrix to the cell cytoskeleton to provide essential forces and signals.   the integrin, talin, and actin filament form a linear complex of which both ends are typically anchored to the extracellular matrices via integrins. Integrins, a central family of cellular ECM receptors, have been implicated in these processes but their specific role in ES cell self-renewal remains unclear. Attachment to the extracellular matrix is mediated by a complex of adhesion proteins, including integrins, signaling molecules, actin and actin-binding proteins, and scaffolding proteins. Beta 1 integrin binding plays a role in the constant traction force generation in response to varying stiffness for cells grown on mature cardiac extracellular matrix."
Has protein citrullination been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis?,yes,": Citrullination has become a hot topic within recent years due to its involvement in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis and fibrosis.  Current literature suggests that increased levels of citrullinated proteins are found in several if not all inflammatory diseases.  Antibodies directed against citrullinated proteins and peptides (ACPAs) are the most specific serological markers available for diagnosing RA.  Citrullination of proteins is well described in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and hypercitrullination of proteins may be related to inflammation in general.  Some ACPA are remarkably effective as diagnostics in autoimmune disorders, most notably rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several ACPA can be observed before other clinical RA manifestations are apparent.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein/peptide autoantibodies (ACPAs).  Anti-citrullinated peptides as autoantigens in rheumatoid arthritis-relevance to treatment. The implications of citrullination affecting integrin binding in disease open up a new area of study and might have implications for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. In this paper, we will review the three of the main classes of PTMs already associated with RA: citrullination, carbamylation, and oxidation. Citrullinated collagen II (CII) is a well-known autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Among the RA-associated autoantibodies, especially anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have been studied intensively in the last decade. Protein citrullination is a posttranslational modification that has attracted increased attention, especially for its involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Identification of citrullinated cellular fibronectin in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Cellular fibronectin (cFn) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and we previously demonstrated the presence of citrullinated cFn in rheumatoid synovial tissues.  . In rheumatoid arthritis, PAD4 and protein citrullination are increased in inflamed joints, and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) form against citrullinated antigens are formed."
Is the circadian clock involved in ribosome biogenesis?,yes,"The circadian clock coordinates ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that the circadian clock exerts its function also through the regulation of mRNA translation. Namely, the circadian clock influences the temporal translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in ribosome biogenesis by controlling the transcription of translation initiation factors as well as the clock-dependent rhythmic activation of signaling pathways involved in their regulation. Moreover, the circadian oscillator directly regulates the transcription of ribosomal protein mRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. Thus the circadian clock exerts a major role in coordinating transcription and translation steps underlying ribosome biogenesis. Namely, the circadian clock influences the temporal translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in ribosome biogenesis by controlling the transcription of translation initiation factors as well as the clock-dependent rhythmic activation of signaling pathways involved in their regulation The circadian clock coordinates ribosome biogenesis Here we show that the circadian clock exerts its function also through the regulation of mRNA translation Here we show that the circadian clock exerts its function also through the regulation of mRNA translation.

Isn't it possible to purify pseudopodia to be used for proteomic analysis?,no,"we developed an approach to biochemically isolate the pseudopodium from the cell body using 3.0-micrometer porous filters for large-scale quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis. Recent work using unique subcellular fractionation methodologies combined with spatial genomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic profiling has provided insight into the invadopodiome and pseudopodiome signaling networks  ere, we purified the pseudopodial proteomes tumor cells were placed on a fibronectin-coated porous membrane to form pseudopodia. According to the motile potentials of the cells, the cells formed pseudopodial microprocesses in the pores. An excimer laser, which was used for ophthalmic refractive surgeries, horizontally ablated cells at the membrane surface to remove the cell body.  we describe methods for the immunoaffinity purification of phosphotyrosine proteins (pY) from pseudopodia that have been isolated from migratory cells. These methods are compatible with current mass spectrometry-based protein identification technologies and can be utilized for the large-scale identification of the pseudopodium pY proteome in various migratory cell lines, including primary and cancer cells."
Are CpG islands located close to housekeeping genes?,yes,"our analysis indicates that the association of CGIs with housekeeping genes is not as strong as previously estimated CpG islands are preferentially located at the start of transcription of housekeeping genes and are associated with tissue-specific genes It has been envisaged that CpG islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of housekeeping genes. These regions represent about 1% of genomic DNA and are generally found in the promoter region of housekeeping genes. CpG islands are stretches of DNA sequence that are enriched in the (CpG)n repeat and are present in close association with all housekeeping genes as well as some tissue-specific genes in the mammalian genome. CpG islands, which are found almost exclusively at the 5'-end of housekeeping genes In housekeeping and many tissue-specific genes, the promoter is embedded in a so-called CpG island. All housekeeping and widely expressed genes have a CpG island covering the transcription start, whereas 40% of the genes with a tissue-specific or limited expression are associated with islands Methylation-free CpG clusters, so-called HTF islands, are most often associated with the promoter regions of housekeeping genes, whereas genes expressed in a single-cell type are usually deficient in these sequences. Unmethylated CpG rich islands are a feature of vertebrate DNA: they are associated with housekeeping and many tissue specific genes. CpG islands were associated with the 5' ends of all housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3' ends of some tissue-specific genes."
Isn't recursive splicing more common in short introns?,yes,"Recent work in human and fruitfly tissues revealed that long introns are extensively processed cotranscriptionally and in a stepwise manner, before their two flanking exons are spliced together Cutting a Long Intron Short: Recursive Splicing and Its Implications.  Furthermore, we uncover the potential to investigate the multi-step nature of splicing, assessing various types of recursive splicing events Recursive splicing is a process in which large introns are removed in multiple steps by re-splicing at ratchet points--5' splice sites recreated after splicing. Together, these results indicate that recursive splicing is commonly used in Drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the mechanisms by which some large introns are removed. Recursive splicing in long vertebrate genes. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates.  The peculiarities of large intron splicing in animals. These ""large introns"" must be spliced out of the pre-mRNA in a timely fashion, which involves bringing together distant 5' and 3' acceptor and donor splice sites. Using a computational analysis of the genomic sequences, we show that vertebrates lack the proper enrichment of RP-sites in their large introns, and, therefore, require some other method to aid splicing Subdivision of large introns in Drosophila by recursive splicing at nonexonic elements. Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of introns>20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within introns<10 kb. These transcripts arise by use of two alternative transcription sites and complex alternative splicing mechanisms and encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains and a common internal domain where the RGS domain is found. These patterns of enrichment and conservation indicate that recursive splice sites are advantageous in the context of long introns. Many genes with important roles in development and disease contain exceptionally long introns, but special mechanisms for their expression have not been investigated. However, some long Drosophila melanogaster introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing. The effect of splice site strength was context-dependent and much more significant for the 3' splice site of the longer alternative intron than for the 3' splice site of the shorter alternative intron and the common 5' splice sites; it was also more significant in the rat minigene than in the mouse minigene.

Are there enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)?,yes,"active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). eRNAs are distinct from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but these two species of noncoding RNAs may share a similar role in the activation of mRNA transcription  eRNAs may then facilitate enhancer-promoter interaction or activate promoter-driven transcription Enhancer RNAs: a class of long noncoding RNAs synthesized at enhancers Enhancer RNAs and regulated transcriptional programs enhancers have been found to be broadly transcribed, resulting in the production of enhancer-derived RNAs, or eRNAs The emerging roles of eRNAs in transcriptional regulatory networks we found certain enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) regulate chromatin accessibility of the transcriptional machinery at loci encoding master regulators of myogenesis (i.e., MyoD/MyoG), thus suggesting their significance and site-specific impact in cellular programming Enhancer RNAs: the new molecules of transcription  the discovery that distal regulatory elements known as enhancers are transcribed and such enhancer-derived transcripts (eRNAs) serve a critical function in transcriptional activation has added a new dimension to transcriptional regulation eRNAs reach the heart of transcription Recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which are long non-coding RNAs transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation. Since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding RNAs termed ""enhancer RNAs"" (eRNAs), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated. Recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established. In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).  A subset of enhancers are occupied by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and transcribed to produce long non-coding RNAs termed eRNAs.  Very recent evidence has indicted that some eRNAs play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by helping recruit and/or stabilize binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes.  In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation.  Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4. The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of messenger RNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis. A function of CBP at enhancers may be to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as we also observed activity-regulated RNAPII binding to thousands of enhancers. Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4.  Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established. Here we show that eRNAs facilitate the transition of paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) into productive elongation by acting as a decoy for the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex upon induction of immediate early genes (IEGs) in neurons.

Aren't people with blood group O protected against severe Malaria?,no,"Differential carbonylation of cytoskeletal proteins in blood group O erythrocytes: potential role in protection against severe malaria. . Our findings indicate a possible correlation between the protection against severe malaria in blood group O individuals and a specific pattern of 4-HNE-carbonylation of cytoskeleton proteins. There is a predominance of blood group O in malaria-endemic regions, and several lines of evidence suggest that ABO blood groups may influence the outcome of P. falciparum infection These data provide the first evidence that ABO blood group antigens influence macrophage clearance of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and suggest an additional mechanism by which blood group O may confer resistance to severe malaria. Blood group phenotypes A and B are risk factors for cerebral malaria in Odisha, India. type O is significantly associated with protection against CM, patients with type A and B group had increased risk for developing CM. Blood group O protects against severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria through the mechanism of reduced rosetting. Malaria has been a major selective force on the human population, and several erythrocyte polymorphisms have evolved that confer resistance to severe malaria. Plasmodium falciparum rosetting, a parasite virulence phenotype associated with severe malaria, is reduced in blood group O erythrocytes compared with groups A, B, and AB, but the contribution of the ABO blood group system to protection against severe malaria has received little attention We hypothesized that blood group O may confer resistance to severe falciparum malaria through the mechanism of reduced rosetting. It appears that individuals who are of blood-group O are relatively resistant to the severe disease caused by P. falciparum infection."
Can't the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,no,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing."

This genetic defect shows sex linked inheritance and a marked heterogeneity. G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in the world.  Study of the deficiency pattern amongst family members of the enzyme deficient subjects confirmed the X-linked inheritance of G-6-PD deficiency. This was caused by Glucose-6-Phosphate-Dehydrogenase-Deficiency, which could be demonstrated by a red-cell-enzyme analysis. The investigation of the patient's whole family showed the typical recessive X-linked inheritance of this enzyme-defect. Frequency and clinical manifestations of this defect are discussed.

Isn't there an association between serum interleukin-6 concentrations and outcomes of stroke patients?,no,"In addition, IL-6 concentrations affect clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke. After appropriate adjustment, the odds ratios for the association of markers and poor outcome (comparing the upper and the lower third) were interleukin-6, 3.1 (95% CI: 1.9-5.0); C-reactive protein, 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2-3.1); fibrinogen, 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0-2.36); white cell count, 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3-3.4); and glucose 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.1). The results for interleukin-6 were similar to other studies.  -6 and IL-10 levels were higher in patients with poor outcome. On logistic regression analysis, higher values of IL-6 were significantly associated with clinical outcome at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.54).  In hemorrhagic stroke, high levels of IL-6 in the early phase indicated a poor neurological outcome. Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points. Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0.001 for NIHSS and p=0.001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-IL-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.  Another negative correlation was found between IL-6 and CNS scores (r = -0.451, p = 0.000). In addition, increased levels of IL-6 and reduced levels of protein C and protein S may play a role in acute ischemic stroke severity. Variables that are predictors of adverse stroke outcome include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1."
Isn't flibanserin effetive for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder?,no,"Mechanism of action of flibanserin, a multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA), in hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Flibanserin is a novel multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA) that improves sexual functioning in premenopausal women who suffer from reduced sexual interest and desire. Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Sprout Pharmaceuticals is only for premenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: In naturally postmenopausal women with HSDD, flibanserin, compared with placebo, has been associated with improvement in sexual desire, improvement in the number of SSEs, and reduced distress associated with low sexual desire, and is well tolerated. INTRODUCTION: Flibanserin is a mixed 5-HT1A agonist/5-HT2A antagonist that has been developed for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women BACKGROUND: Flibanserin, a novel serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonist and 5-HT(2A) antagonist, has been shown to increase sexual desire and reduce distress in women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD).  Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most commonly described form of female sexual dysfunction. There is currently no pharmacological therapy approved to treat HSDD, and therefore, there is an unmet medical need for the development of efficacious treatment alternatives. Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U.S.  Sexual function adverse events across flibanserin groups were generally comparable to placebo.Although these studies were not designed or powered to compare sexual function outcomes, results suggested a potential benefit of flibanserin on sexual function, particularly on female sexual desire, and provided a rationale to evaluate the efficacy of flibanserin as a treatment for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder."
Is SUMOylation a post-translational modification in eukaryotes?,yes,"SUMOylation, the conjugation of target proteins with SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier), is a type of post-translational modification in eukaryotes and involves the sequential action of activation (E1), conjugation (E2) and ligation (E3) enzymes.  Plants have evolved to cope with changing environmental conditions. One way plants achieve this is through post-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitination and SUMOylation. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification essential in most eukaryotes that regulates stability, localization, activity, or interaction of a multitude of proteins. SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes.  Post-translational modification by SUMO is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that plays very important regulatory roles in many cellular processes.  SUMOylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression. Although the SUMOylation pathway has been identified and investigated in many eukaryotes, the mechanisms of SUMOylation in regulating the functions of various substrates are still poorly understood.  SUMOylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes. SUMOylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for genome stability. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Besides phosphorylation or ubiquitylation, for which many examples of modulation by pathogens exist, a post-translational modification called SUMOylation was recently shown to be targeted by pathogenic bacteria. cruzi SUMOylated proteins are similarly modified, indicating conserved functions for protein SUMOylation in this early divergent eukaryote. PML is a potent tumor suppressor and proapoptotic factor and is functionally regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination.

However, the effects of pathogenic bacteria on SUMOylation, an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells, remain largely unknown.  A novel post-translational modification of nucleolin, SUMOylation at Lys-294, mediates arsenite-induced cell death by regulating gadd45� mRNA stability. Drosophila Bicoid is a substrate of sumoylation and its activator function is subject to inhibition by this post-translational modification. Here, we demonstrate that SUMOylation of RelB might be one of these post-translational modifications rendering the function of the NF-�B transcription factor RelB.  In the last decade, SUMOylation has emerged as an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes.

The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in eukaryotes is an essential post-translational modification required for a variety of cellular processes, development and organelle biogenesis. Post-translational modification by SUMO is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that plays very important regulatory roles in many cellular processes. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. We identified 70 phosphorylation and four acetylation events in proximity to SUMOylation sites, and we provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3. SUMOylation regulates target proteins involved in all nuclear processes including transcription, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, precursor-mRNA splicing and ribosome assembly. SUMOylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for genome stability. Using high-resolution MS, we have studied global SUMOylation in human cells in a site-specific manner, identifying a total of>4,300 SUMOylation sites in>1,600 proteins. We quantitatively studied SUMOylation dynamics in response to SUMO protease inhibition, proteasome inhibition and heat shock. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. We identified 70 phosphorylation and four acetylation events in proximity to SUMOylation sites, and we provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. Indeed, SU(VAR)3-7 is sumoylated at lysine K839; this modification is required for localization of SU(VAR)3-7 at pericentric heterochromatin, chromosome 4, and telomeres. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. Our results suggest a new level of regulation of Sall activity in vivo during animal development through post-translational modification by sumoylation. BACKGROUND: Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier protein (SUMO) is a key regulator of nuclear functions but little is known regarding the role of the post-translational modification sumoylation outside of the nucleus, particularly in the Central Nervous System (CNS).METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that the expression levels of SUMO-modified substrates as well as the components of the sumoylation machinery are temporally and spatially regulated in the developing rat brain.

Is a mutation of the  ZIKV's membrane protein prM responsible for the microcephaly in new-born infants?,yes,"Here we show that a single serine-to-asparagine substitution [Ser139→Asn139(S139N)] in the viral polyprotein substantially increased ZIKV infectivity in both human and mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and led to more severe microcephaly in the mouse fetus, as well as higher mortality rates in neonatal mice. A single mutation in the prM protein of Zika virus contributes to fetal microcephaly."
Isn't there a relationship between thyroid hormone altered metabolism and coronary artery disease?,no,"The results showed that higher levels of TSH within the reference range were independently associated with the presence of CAD only among subjects less than or equal to 65 years old, suggesting age might influence the relationship. FT3 levels within the normal range were inversely correlated with the presence and severity of CAD. Moreover, lower FT3 concentrations were correlated with the Gensini score and independently predicted the presence and severity of CAD. High TSH within the reference range was associated with increased risk of coronary death in women (P(trend) 0·005), but not in men. The risk of coronary death was also increased among women with subclinical hypothyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism, compared to women with TSH of 0·50-1·4 mU/l.   Prevalence of CHD was more common in hypothyroid and moderate SCH patients. The angiographic results were as follows: significant coronary disease (SH 28.1% vs. non-SH 43.8%; p=0.087); three-vessel disease (9.4% vs. 9.9%; p=0.919); two-vessel disease (12.5% vs. 13.4%; p=0.892); single-vessel disease (6.3% vs. 29.5%; p=0.051); minimal lesions (9.4% vs. 10.9%; p=0.794); and no coronary disease (62.4% vs, 45.3%; p=0.064). Lower fT3 levels were predictive of both single-vessel (p = 0.012) and multivessel (p = 0.009) CAD. Through a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fT3 was still linked to the presence of CAD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.68, p < 0.001). Our study showed that FT(4) levels were associated with the presence and the severity of CAD. Also, this study suggests that elevated serum FT(4) levels even within normal range could be a risk factor for CAD.  The present meta-analysis indicates that sub-clinical hypothyroidism is associated with both, a significant risk of CHD at baseline and at follow-up. The incidence of multi-vessel disease was higher in patients with high TSH level (p=0.026). TSH level showed a significant correlation with age (r=0.109, p=0.044) and Gensini's score (r=0.117, p=0.045). The multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR 2.39, p=0.001), diabetes (OR 3.74, p=0.001), creatinine (OR 2.06, p=0.008), and smoking (OR 1.85, p=0.045) were independent predictors for significant coronary artery disease, but TSH level did not predict coronary artery stenosis. These data in patients referred for coronary angiography suggest that variation of thyroid function within the statistical normal range may influence the presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis."
Doesn't have the protein SETMAR (Metnase) a transposase domain?,no,"Metnase (SETMAR) is a SET-transposase fusion protein that promotes nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair in humans. The transposase domain protein Metnase/SETMAR suppresses chromosomal translocations.  Metnase (also termed SETMAR) is a fusion of a histone methylase and transposase protein that arose specifically in primates.  the only intact Hsmar1 transposase gene exists within a chimeric SET-transposase fusion protein referred to as Metnase or SETMAR.  The Metnase transposase has been remarkably conserved through evolution; Metnase (also known as SETMAR) is a SET and transposase fusion protein in humans and plays a positive role in double-strand break (DSB) repair. While the SET domain possesses histone lysine methyltransferase activity, the transposase domain is responsible for 5'-terminal inverted repeat (TIR)-specific binding, DNA looping, and DNA cleavage activities.  Metnase is a fusion gene comprising a SET histone methyl transferase domain and a transposase domain derived from the Mariner transposase. ulated by the DNA repair component Metnase (also termed SETMAR). Metnase contains a SET histone methylase and transposase nuclease domain Metnase is a human SET and transposase domain protein  The human set and transposase domain protein Metnase  of transposase-related sequences in humans are pseudogenes. We recently isolated and characterized a SET and transposase domain protein termed Metnase that promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Both the SET and transposase domain were required for its NHEJ activity. Metnase, also known as SETMAR, is a SET and transposase fusion protein with an undefined role in mammalian DNA repair. Biochemical characterization of a SET and transposase fusion protein, Metnase: i Metnase (SETMAR) is a SET and transposase fusion protein that promotes in vivo end joining activity and mediates genomic integration of foreign DNA.   This transposase coding region is part of the SETMAR gene, in which a histone methylatransferase SET domain is fused to an Hsmar1 transposase domain.  The human SETMAR protein preserves most of the activities of the ancestral Hsmar1 transposase. ere we investigate the activity of the human SETMAR protein, a highly expressed fusion between a histone H3 methylase and a mariner family transposase. SETMAR, a new primate chimeric gene resulting from fusion of a SET histone methyltransferase gene to the transposase gene of a mobile element. We identified a protein, termed Metnase, that has a SET domain and a transposase/nuclease domain.  Metnase has a nuclease domain that shares homology with the Transposase family. Metnase (also called SETMAR) is a SET and transposase domain protein that promotes both DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and restart of stalled replication forks."
Isn't the Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease?,no,"A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  These findings suggest that aberrant SR Ca2+ release and increased susceptibility to delayed afterdepolarizations underlie triggered arrhythmic activity in human Ala96 HRC carriers. The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers. These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers. HRC plays an important role in myocyte differentiation and in antiapoptotic cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion induced cardiac injury. Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release. Indeed, evidence from genetic models of JCN and HRC indicate that they are important in cardiophysiology as alterations in these proteins affect SR Ca(2+) handling and cardiac function. In addition, downregulation of JCN and HRC may contribute to Ca(2+) cycling perturbations manifest in the failing heart, where their protein levels are significantly reduced. The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM. AAV-mediated knock-down of HRC exacerbates transverse aorta constriction-induced heart failure. Chronic overexpression of HRC that may disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy Ablation of HRC showed relatively normal phenotypes under basal condition, but exhibited a significantly increased susceptibility to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy Our results present evidence that down-regulation of HRC could deteriorate cardiac function in TAC-FH through perturbed SR-mediated Ca(2+) cycling However, AAV9-mediated HRC-KD in TAC-FH was associated with decreased fractional shortening and increased cardiac fibrosis compared with control. Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+) binding protein, specifically expressed in striated muscles of mammals. In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein. Recently, a potential role in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis has been assigned to HRC due to its activity as regulator of SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) release. In addition, HRC null mice displayed a significantly exaggerated response to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy by isoproterenol compared to their wild-type littermates. The exaggerated response of HRC knockout mice to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy is consistent with a regulatory role for HRCBP in calcium handling in vivo and suggests that mutations in HRC, in combination with other genetic or environmental factors, might contribute to pathological hypertrophy and heart failure. We observed that the levels of HRC were reduced in animal models and human heart failure. Collectively, these data indicate that alterations in expression levels of HRC are associated with impaired cardiac SR Ca homeostasis and contractile function. Abnormal calcium cycling and cardiac arrhythmias associated with the human Ser96Ala genetic variant of histidine-rich calcium-binding protein. The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy"
Aren't there canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes?,yes,"Absence of canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes. The interplay of active and repressive histone modifications is assumed to have a key role in the regulation of gene expression. In contrast to this generally accepted view, we show that the transcription of genes temporally regulated during fly and worm development occurs in the absence of canonically active histone modifications. Conversely, strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability, an association that we also observe in mammals. Our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of RNA, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development. In the latter case, regulation by transcription factors would have a comparatively more important regulatory role than chromatin marks. Absence of canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes Absence of canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes. In contrast to this generally accepted view, we show that the transcription of genes temporally regulated during fly and worm development occurs in the absence of canonically active histone modifications."
Are TAD boundaries in Drosophila depleted in highly-expressed genes?,no,"Furthermore, we find that these TAD boundaries are present irrespective of the expression and looping of genes located between them. In particular, Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into topologically associating domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes.  The insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions are each enriched for distinct epigenetic marks and are each correlated with different gene expression levels We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity combine to shape the local packing of the A. thaliana nuclear genome. Disruptions of topological chromatin domains cause pathogenic rewiring of gene-enhancer interactions. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome. The three-dimensional organization of a genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure. Ectopically expressed roX1 and roX2 RNAs target HAS on the X chromosome in trans and, via spatial proximity, induce spreading of the MSL complex in cis, leading to increased expression of neighboring autosomal genes.  Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin. However, Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes."
Aren't ACTA1 (alpha actin) and NEB (nebulin) genes related to nemaline myopathy?,no,"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a group of congenital myopathies, characterized by the presence of distinct rod-like inclusions ""nemaline bodies"" in the sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle fibers. To date, ACTA1, NEB, TPM3, TPM2, TNNT1, and CFL2 have been found to cause NM. Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). 20-25% of NM cases carry ACTA1 defects and these particular mutations usually induce substitutions of single residues in the actin protein.  Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a genetically and clinically heterogenous muscle disorder, which is myopathologically characterized by nemaline bodies. Mutations in six genes have been reported to cause NM: Nebulin (NEB Pelin 1999), alpha-skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1 Nowak 1999), alpha-slow tropomyosin (TPM3 Laing 1995), beta-tropomyosin (TPM2 Donner 2002), slow troponin T (TNNT1 Johnston 2000) and cofilin 2 (CFL2 Agrawal 2007). The majority of cases are due to mutation in NEB and ACTA1.  Nemaline myopathy is a heterogenous form of congenital myopathy characterised by a variable spectrum of clinical features, predominated in the severe form by profound muscle hypotonia and weakness accompanied by respiratory insufficiency. The clinical variability, with differing age of onset and severity of symptoms makes the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy difficult in some cases. Severe forms of nemaline myopathy may be caused by mutation of a number of different genes: skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1), nebulin (NEB) and alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3), all of which encode components of the sarcomeric thin filaments of skeletal muscle.  Most nemaline myopathy patients have mutations in the nebulin (NEB) or skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) genes.  We report muscle MRI findings of 10 patients from 8 families with nemaline myopathy. Patients with involvement of the nebulin (NEB) gene showed a consistent pattern of selective muscle involvement corresponding to clinical severity. Patients with nemaline myopathy secondary to mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) gene showed diffuse involvement of thigh and leg muscles with relative sparing of the gastrocnemii. Congenital myopathies are clinical and genetic heterogeneous disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness ranging in severity. Three major forms have been identified: actin myopathy, intranuclear rod myopathy, and nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy is the most common of these myopathies and is further subdivided into seven groups according to severity, progressiveness, and age of onset. At present, five genes have been linked to congenital myopathies. These include alpha-actin (ACTA1), alpha- and beta-tropomyosin (TPM3 and TPM2), troponin T (TNNT1), and nebulin (NEB).  Nemaline myopathy is a structural congenital myopathy which may show both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. Mutations in three different genes have been identified as the cause of nemaline myopathy: the gene for slow alpha-tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) at 1q22-23, the nebulin gene (NEB) at 2q21.1-q22, and the actin gene (ACTA1) at 1q42. Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. The clinical spectrum ranges from severe cases with antenatal or neonatal onset and early death to late onset cases with only slow progression. Three genes are known to cause nemaline myopathy: the genes for nebulin (NEB) on chromosome 2q22, slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3) on chromosome 1q21 and skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) on chromosome 1q42.

Haven't hESC been tested for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration?,no,"Development of human embryonic stem cell therapies for age-related macular degeneration In this review, we describe recent approaches to develop cell-based therapies for the treatment of AMD. Recent research has focused on replacing the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer of cells vital to photoreceptor cell health. We discuss the various methods used to differentiate and purify RPE from human embryonic stem cells (HESC), and describe the surgical approaches being used to transplant these cells in existing and forthcoming clinical trials. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by the loss or dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is the most common cause of vision loss among the elderly. Stem-cell-based strategies, using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), may provide an abundant donor source for generating RPE cells in cell replacement therapies. This study contributes to our understanding of the utility of hESC/hiPSC-derived RPE in AMD therapy. Two important early potential hESC applications are the use of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, an untreatable form of macular dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a promising source of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells: cells that can be used for the treatment of common and incurable forms of blindness, such as age-related macular degeneration. A potential application of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is the generation of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common but incurable retinal disease. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a promising source of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells: cells that can be used for the treatment of common and incurable forms of blindness, such as age-related macular degeneration A potential application of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is the generation of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common but incurable retinal disease Assessments of safety and efficacy are crucial before human ESC (hESC) therapies can move into the clinic.

A potential application of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is the generation of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common but incurable retinal disease. RPE cells derived from hESCs (hESC-RPEs) and iPSCs (iPSC-RPEs) express essential RPE markers and can rescue visual function in animal models. Two important early potential hESC applications are the use of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, an untreatable form of macular dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness. Here we show long-term functional rescue using hESC-derived RPE in both the RCS rat and Elov14 mouse, which are animal models of retinal degeneration and Stargardt, respectively."
Isn't NOD1 activated in inflammation?,no,"Nod1 and Nod2 control bacterial infections and inflammation The Nod proteins Nod1 and Nod2 are two NLR family members that trigger immune defense in response to bacterial peptidoglycan Nod proteins fight off bacterial infections by stimulating proinflammatory signaling and cytokine networks and by inducing antimicrobial effectors, such as nitric oxide and antimicrobial peptides. Nod1 is also critically implicated in shaping adaptive immune responses towards bacterial-derived constituents. Together, Nod1 and Nod2 represent central players in the control of immune responses to bacterial infections and inflammation. The innate immune receptor Nod1 protects the intestine from inflammation-induced tumorigenesis. we show that Nod1 deficiency results in the increased development of both colitis-associated and Apc tumor suppressor-related colon tumors. In the absence of Nod1 signaling, there is a greater disruption of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier due to chemically induced injury as manifested by increased surface epithelial apoptosis early on during chemically induced colitis and increased intestinal permeability. The increased intestinal permeability is associated with enhanced inflammatory cytokine production and epithelial cell proliferation in Nod1-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice. Depletion of the gut microbiota suppressed tumor development in Nod1-deficient mice, thus highlighting a link between the commensal bacteria within the intestine and the host innate immune Nod1 signaling pathway in the regulation inflammation-mediated colon cancer development.  NOD1 protein is expressed in the eye and promotes ocular inflammation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion.  NOD1 expression in the eye and functional contribution to IL-1beta-dependent ocular inflammation in mice Polymorphisms in NOD1 are associated with autoinflammatory diseases characterized by uveitis such as Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis NOD1 is homologous to NOD2, which is responsible for an autosomal dominant form of uveitis. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model mice deficient for both Nod1 and Nod2 had attenuated inflammatory pathology, reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, and increased colonization of the mucosal tissue The present study has demonstrated an unexpected role of Nod1 in the development of site-specific vascular inflammation, especially coronary arteritis. Nod1 ligands induce site-specific vascular inflammation Phenotyping of Nod1/2 double deficient mice and characterization of Nod1/2 in systemic inflammation and associated renal disease The present study analyzed Nod1 and Nod2 double deficient (Nod1/2 DKO) mice under physiological and inflammatory conditions Several inflammatory disorders, such as Crohn's disease and asthma, are linked to genetic changes in either Nod1 or Nod2. Systematic analysis of Nod1/2 DKO mice revealed a possible role of Nod1/2 in the development of renal disease during systemic inflammation. NOD1 and NOD2 Signaling in Infection and Inflammation NOD1 engagement generates an inflammatory response via activation of NFκB and MAPK pathways.  In addition we profile novel inhibitors of RIP2 and NOD1 itself, which specifically inhibit NOD1 ligand induced inflammatory signalling in the vasculature.  This data supports the potential utility of NOD1 and RIP2 as therapeutic targets in human disease where vascular inflammation is a clinical feature, such as in sepsis and septic shock. NOD1 expression elicited by iE-DAP in first trimester human trophoblast cells and its potential role in infection-associated inflammation This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of NOD1 in first trimester trophoblast cells, and evaluate the potential role of trophoblast cells in infection-associated inflammation NOD1 may have a role in mediating infection-associated inflammation. Once iE-DAP is recognized by NOD1, the inflammatory response may be induced via NOD1-RICK-NF-κB-mediated pathways. NOD1/2(-/-) mice were protected from HFD-induced inflammation, lipid accumulation, and peripheral insulin intolerance. In contrast, Nod1 gene-deficient mice developed enhanced joint inflammation with concomitant elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cartilage damage, consistent with a model in which Nod1 controls the inflammatory reaction. These data indicate that the NLR family members Nod1 and Nod2 have different functions in controlling inflammation, and that intracellular Nod1-Nod2 interactions may determine the severity of arthritis in this experimental model. Whereas the lymphotoxin pathway was critical for the induction of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 in response to Nod1 agonists, B cell accumulation within the spleen following Nod1-induced systemic inflammation was independent of the lymphotoxin pathway. The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. A key role for the endothelium in NOD1 mediated vascular inflammation: comparison to TLR4 responses. We previously demonstrated that human first-trimester trophoblasts express Nod1 and Nod2, which trigger inflammation upon stimulation. In addition, recent studies have revealed a role for intracellular NOD1 receptors in the regulation of vascular inflammation and metabolism. In conclusion, the present findings describe an important role for NOD1 in the development of insulin resistance and inflammation in pregnancies complicated by GDM. Phenotyping of Nod1/2 double deficient mice and characterization of Nod1/2 in systemic inflammation and associated renal disease. Nod1 activation by bacterial iE-DAP induces maternal-fetal inflammation and preterm labor. The nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognise a wide range of microbial products, as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB).  Nod1 ligands induce site-specific vascular inflammation. The nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognize a wide range of microbial products as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor KB (NFKB), a central regulator of the terminal processes of human labor and delivery.  CONCLUSIONS: We identify NOD proteins as innate immune components that are involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin intolerance.  Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model. In particular, muramyl peptides trigger inflammation, contribute to host defense against microbial infections, and modulate the adaptive immune response to antigens.  Systemic and tissue-specific inflammation was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in NOD ligand-injected mice.  CONCLUSIONS: We identify NOD proteins as innate immune components that are involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin intolerance. Acute activation of NOD proteins by mimetics of bacterial PGNs causes whole-body insulin resistance, bolstering the concept that innate immune responses to distinctive bacterial cues directly lead to insulin resistance.  Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine in intestinal mucosal inflammation, activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein in SW480 cells. These studies suggest that the Th1 cytokine, IFN gamma, activates CARD4/NOD1 transcription and regulate innate immune mechanisms in the condition of intestinal mucosal inflammation. NOD1 activation triggers inflammation, In contrast to enhanced leptin mRNA by LPS and TNFα, NOD1 activation suppressed leptin mRNA in adipocytes, suggesting the differential effects of NOD1 activation in adipocytes.  Overall, our results suggest that NOD1 represents a novel target for adipose inflammation in obesity. NOD1 activation triggers inflammation, antimicrobial mechanisms and autophagy in both epithelial cells and murine macrophages. NOD1 is an intracellular immune receptor that senses peptidoglycan from Gram-negative bacteria and responds by inducing autophagy and activating NF-κB, leading to inflammation-mediated bacterial clearance; however chronic pathogens can evade NOD1-mediated clearance by altering peptidoglycan structure. Bacterial NOD1 activation is positioned as a component of metabolic endotoxemia that can contribute to hyperlipidemia, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance by acting directly on adipocytes. NOD1 ligand also caused inflammation and insulin resistance directly in primary hepatocytes from WT, but not NOD1(-/-), mice. We conclude that NOD1 activation reduced AHR in allergen-induced lung inflammation, which was accompanied by a reduction of allergen-specific T-cell proliferation. The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine in intestinal mucosal inflammation, activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein in SW480 cells."
Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,yes,"High-glucose treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria. Concomitant intra-mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]m) increase resulted in enhanced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation. These events led to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. The novel findings of the study reveal that high glucose induces apoptosis by both mitochondria-dependent and independent pathways via concomitant rise in intracellular calcium. Diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunction has been attributed, in part, to calcium overload within individual myocytes. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy; BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that intracellular Ca2+ overload in cardiac myocytes leads to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The results from the alloxan-rat model of diabetes support the view that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. It has been suggested that the occurrence of an intracellular Ca2+ overload may result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction."

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,no,"Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions By adopting a method originally designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in Drosophila and cephalopods. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish) are active, resourceful predators with a rich behavioural repertoire. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which showed elevated expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin, the suckers and the nervous system. Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a handful of gene families, along with extensive remodelling of genome linkage and repetitive content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological innovations, including their large and complex nervous systems."
Do R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication?,yes,"Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI. We propose that the organized structure of the R-loop is critical for primer RNA function in vivo with important implications for the RNA processing and DNA replication machinery. The precursor primer RNA exists as a persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, known as an R-loop, formed during transcription through the replication origin (Xu, B., and Clayton, D. A. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 3135-3143). We found that overproduction of RecG protein drastically decreased copy numbers of ColE1-type plasmids, which require R-loop formation between the template DNA and a primer RNA transcript (RNA II) for the initiation of replication. These results suggest that overproduced RecG inhibits the initiation of replication by prematurely resolving the R-loops formed at the replication origin region of these plasmids with its unique helicase activity. The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed. We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. This would allow replication to proceed while the original block is repaired or bypassed Furthermore, increased RNaseH expression significantly alleviated genomic instability in deficient fibroblasts suggesting that cotranscriptional R-loops formation contributes to the genesis of replication-dependent DSBs in these cells. Transcription is an important source of replicative stress and consequently, maintenance of genome integrity requires the protection of chromosomes from the deleterious effects arising from the interaction between nascent RNAs and template DNA, leading to stable DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loop) formation. Strikingly, we found that attenuation of replication strongly suppresses R-loop-mediated DNA rearrangements in both E. coli and HeLa cells. More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stabilit R-loop-mediated genomic instability is caused by impairment of replication fork progression When any of these processes are not properly coordinated, aberrant outcomes such as fork reversal and R-loop formation arise and trigger unscheduled recombinogenic events and genome rearrangements.  Many studies show that cells can manage R loop formation with efficiency, and can also process the R-loops already formed in the cell, and by which, the bad effects of R-loops on DNA replication, gene mutation and homologous recombination can be regulated. Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells.  In agreement with this, we found that R-loops co-localize with the ORC within the same CpG island region in a significant fraction of these efficient replication origins, precisely at the position displaying the highest density of G4 motifs.  connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. We show that RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) form at sites of transcription/replication collisions and that RNase H1 functions to suppress CFS instability. R-loops and initiation of DNA replication in human cells: a missing link? Stable RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) prime the initiation of replication in Escherichia coli cells. We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. Immediately after infection, RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) occur on (at least some) replication origins, with the annealed RNA serving as a primer for leading-strand synthesis in one direction. Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. ColE1 plasmid origins of replication and oriK sites initiate primosome assembly by an RNA-DNA hybrid structure known as R-loop. This scenario builds on the connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. The multiple cleavage sites on the R-loop substrate match the priming sites observed in vivo, suggesting that RNase MRP alone is capable of generating virtually all of the leading-strand replication primers. Mechanisms of primer RNA synthesis and D-loop/R-loop-dependent DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Alternative oriC-independent modes of replication initiation are possible, one of which is constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR) from transcription-associated RNA-DNA hybrids or R-loops. Our results suggest that Top1 execute this function by suppressing the formation of DNA-RNA hybrids during transcription, these so-called R-loops interfering with the progression of replication forks. Critical role of R-loops in processing replication blocks. The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed. Competition between the RNA transcript and the nontemplate DNA strand during R-loop formation in vitro: a nick can serve as a strong R-loop initiation site. More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stability.  Consistent with this hypothesis, the 3' ends of the mitochondrial R-loop formed by in vitro transcription are located close to the initiation sites of the mitochondrial DNA replication.  A hybrid G-quadruplex structure formed between RNA and DNA explains the extraordinary stability of the mitochondrial R-loop. Previous studies have shown that the newly synthesized primers form a stable and persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, a R-loop, near the leading-strand origin of DNA replication.  Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI."
Are Alu elements transcribed?,yes,"Alu RNAs in the human transcriptome Alu elements can be transcribed in two different ways, by two independent polymerases 'Free Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol III from their own promoter 'embedded Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol II as part of protein- and non-protein-coding RNAs Recent studies have demonstrated that both free and embedded Alu RNAs play a major role in post transcriptional regulation of gene expression Alu RNAs transcribed from these elements are present at low levels at normal cell growth but various stress conditions increase their abundance Alu RNAs are known to bind the cognate proteins SRP9/14 Increased level of polymerase III transcribed Alu RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue we used primer extension analysis to determine the level of polymerase III directed Alu RNA and found an increased expression of Alu RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma Widespread RNA editing of embedded alu elements in the human transcriptome Transcribed Alu sequences can alter splicing patterns by generating new exons In the vast majority of edited RNAs, A-to-I substitutions are clustered within transcribed sense or antisense Alu sequences Alu-associated RNA editing may be a mechanism for marking nonstandard transcripts, not destined for translation the case of transcribed Alus Differential levels of Alu RNA during different conditions of stress also await clear functional understanding Alu expression in human cell lines and their retrotranspositional potential Alu expression likely varies by cell type, growth conditions and transformation state The vast majority of Alu loci potentially transcribed by RNA pol III lack important sequence features for retrotransposition and the majority of potentially active Alu loci in the genome (scored high ERP) belong to young Alu subfamilies We suggest that the genomic sequences upstream from most Alu elements and 7SL pseudogenes do not contain this element, and consequently that only a small subset of such sequences can be transcribed in vivo. These similarities suggest that some Alu family sequences are mobile genetic elements that can transpose to new chromosomal loci using as an intermediate a cDNA copy of an RNA transcribed from the Alu family element by RNA polymerase III. Primate and rodent genomes are populated with hundreds of thousands copies of Alu and B1 elements dispersed by retroposition, i.e., by genomic reintegration of their reverse transcribed RNAs. Members of this family are readily transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase III, but RNA corresponding to only a small sub-set of Alu elements has been found in vivo. Alu interspersed repetitive elements possess internal RNA polymerase III promoters which are strongly transcribed in vitro, yet these elements are nearly silent in somatic cells. The amplification of genomic Alu elements by retroposition, i.e. by reintegration of reverse-transcribed RNA, suggests that Alu RNA plays an important role in this process. We report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of Alu RNAs transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed Alu elements. The results of this study indicate that Alu and 7SL RNA gene sequences interact with cellular factors that are important for HeLa cell proliferation and suggest that these pol III-transcribed elements may be involved in the regulation of cellular growth. Then we used primer extension analysis to determine the level of polymerase III directed Alu RNA and found an increased expression of Alu RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma Alu interspersed repetitive elements possess internal RNA polymerase III promoters which are strongly transcribed in vitro, yet these elements are nearly silent in somatic cells 'Free Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol III from their own promoter, while 'embedded Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol II as part of protein- and non-protein-coding RNAs We report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of Alu RNAs transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed Alu elements Transcribed Alu sequences can alter splicing patterns by generating new exons, but other impacts of intragenic Alu elements on their host RNA are largely unexplored Both 7SL genes and Alu elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and we show here that the internal 7SL promoter lies within the Alu-like part of the 7SL gene Each group revealed a divergent pattern of transcribed Alu elements"
Can SUMO affect calcium homeostasis?,yes,"Increasing SUMOylation levels correlated inversely with calcium influx in sensory neurons. CRMP2 deSUMOylation by SUMO proteases SENP1 and SENP2 normalized calcium influx to those in the CRMP2AAA mutant. Thus, our results identify a novel role for SUMO modification in CRMP2/CaV2.2 signaling pathway Moreover, SUMO1 overexpression in isolated cardiomyocytes augmented contractility and accelerated Ca(2+) decay.  RIM1α SUMOylation at lysine residue K502 facilitates the clustering of CaV2.1 calcium channels and enhances the Ca(2+) influx necessary for vesicular release, whereas non-SUMOylated RIM1α participates in the docking/priming of synaptic vesicles and maintenance of active zone structure.

Can't Diabetes be caused by a defect in a potassium chanel?,no,"Mutations in KATP channel genes can result in hypo- or hypersecretion of insulin, as in neonatal diabetes mellitus and congenital hyperinsulinism, respectively. To date, all patients affected by neonatal diabetes due to a mutation in the pore-forming subunit of the channel (Kir6.2, KCNJ11) are heterozygous for the mutation.  e report the first clinical case of neonatal diabetes caused by a homozygous KCNJ11 mutation Diffuse congenital hyperinsulinism in infancy (CHI-D) arises from mutations inactivating the KATP channel; We report a case of a 6-week-old infant with diabetes mellitus based on a genetic defect in the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), an ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel protein. In diabetes, vascular KATP channel function is impaired."

Isn't there an association between FGFR3 mutation and plagiocephaly?,no,"Series of neurosurgical interventions were carried out, principally for acrocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly. The most common achondroplasia mutation, a p.Gly380Arg in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, was detected.   The most common mutation for achondroplasia (FGFR3 Gly380Arg, resulting in 1138G>A) was identified. Imaging studies disclosed complex craniosynostosis and neurosurgical intervention was carried out, particularly for posterior plagiocephaly. FGFR mutations and plagiocephaly. FGFR genes have important effects on bone development, and mutations in 4 ""hot spot"" exons of FGFR1-3 are found in many patients with craniosynostosis and some with synostotic plagiocephaly.  Mutation analyses in the FGFR3 gene revealed nucleotide alterations located in the mutational hot spot at amino acid residue 250 (g.C749). RESULTS: In our cohort of 159 patients with various craniosynostosis syndromes, mutations were found in 100% of patients with Apert syndrome, 83.3% with Pfeiffer syndrome, 72.7% with Crouzon syndrome, 50.0% with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, 27.7% with plagiocephaly, 31.8% with brachicephaly, 20% of complex cases, and 6.9% of mixed cases.  The genetic alterations that could cause unilateral coronal synostosis are more elusive. Mutations were found in eight of 47 patients: two patients with different single-amino-acid changes in FGFR2, three patients with FGFR3 Pro250Arg, and three patients with TWIST mutations.  Other abnormalities in the craniofacial region and extremities were clues to a particular mutation in FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST, or the X-linked mutation.  To determine whether the autosomal dominant fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) Pro250Arg mutation causes anterior plagiocephaly, patients with either apparently sporadic unicoronal synostosis (N = 37) or other forms of anterior plagiocephaly (N = 10) were studied for this mutation. The occurrence of the FGFR3 mutation among patients with unicoronal synostosis provides evidence for a genetic basis of certain forms of plagiocephaly. None of the 6 patients with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly and none of the 4 patients with additional suture synostosis had the FGFR3 mutation. Between January and December of 1996, patients with a diagnosis of plagiocephaly at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were evaluated for the FGFR3 mutation.

Couldn't Arimidex (anastrozole) cause hot flashes?,no,"More than a third of breast cancer patients undergoing aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment report joint pain. In the first 6 weeks, emergence of joint pain was associated with increase in general pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and decreased sexual activity. Antiestrogen therapy can cause vasomotor symptoms similar to those occurring during menopause, including hot flashes. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of acupuncture for treatment of hot flashes in Korean patients with breast cancer receiving antiestrogen therapy. 10 patients with breast cancer who were undergoing antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or anastrozole and who were suffering from hot flashes. During treatment, severity of hot flashes was reduced by 70%-95% in all patients. anastrozole has been widely used in Japan as an adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal, hormone-responsive breast cancer patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the rate of bone fracture and bone mineral density (BMD) during anastrozole treatment in Japanese patients. Musculoskeletal disorders were the most common (26.1 %), and hot flashes were the second most common adverse event (7.9 %). To compare the effect of therapy with anastrozole versus a combination of fulvestrant and anastrozole in women in first relapse of endocrine-responsive breast cancer. fulvestrant loading dose (LD) regimen followed by monthly injection plus 1 mg of anastrozole daily or to 1 mg of anastrozole daily alone. Incidences of prespecified adverse events (AEs) were similar. Hot flashes were more common in the experimental arm: 63 patients (24.6%) versus 35 patients (13.8%) in the standard arm (P = .0023). The third-generation agents (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) have been shown to be more effective and safer than the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifen. AIs are well tolerated and cause a lower incidence of gynecological symptoms (vaginal bleeding, discharge, and endometrial neoplasia), venous thromboembolic events, and hot flashes compared with tamoxifen. Mood disturbances, somnolence, anxiety, fatigue, hot flashes, and memory impairment have been reported among patients receiving anastrozole as adjuvant therapy. Twenty-five PM-BC patients received, in sequence, leuprorelin, taxane-anthracycline induction chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a platinum-based intensification high-dose CT, followed by leuprorelin and anastrazole for five years. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was observed in all patients, no patient showed a decrease of cardiac ejection fraction and hot flashes and arthralgias were of moderate intensity. Of the patients treated with anastrozole, 3 (37.5%) reported toxicity, with 1 report each of decreased libido, leg swelling, and depression (12.5%). Toxicity was reported in 2 patients taking letrozole (40%), with both reporting peripheral edema, and 1 reporting hot flashes. Patients were treated with goserelin 3.6 mg subcutaneous monthly and began anastrozole 1-mg daily 21 days after the first injection of goserelin. The most common adverse events were fatigue (50%), arthralgias (53%), and hot flashes (59%). These studies were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AIs in the following clinical settings: 1) as initial adjuvant therapy (the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial, Breast International Group Trial 1-98), AIs were tolerated well, and patients who received them experienced fewer thrombolic events and less endometrial cancer, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal bleeding compared with patients who receive tamoxifen. It has been suggested that the association of AI and GnRh analogues and AI could block the two routes of oestrogen production in males, and therefore this approach could increase efficacy. However, it could also enhance the rate of adverse events (hot flashes, sexual impotence, etc.). We reviewed therapeutic effects and harmful side effects in 33 patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer who underwent treatment with Anastrozole 1 mg/day in our department. The most frequent harmful side effects were rise in total cholesterol, general fatigue, hot flashes and arthralgia (9.1%). We analyzed the changes in frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms in patients receiving tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors and identified factors influencing these symptoms. Both first-line tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors induced an increase in the occurrence and severity of hot flashes (p<0.0001 and p=0.014, respectively). To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the selective aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex), we conducted a phase II trial in 53 women with asymptomatic recurrent/persistent müllerian cancer. Toxicity was modest (grade I) and infrequent, with the most common toxicities being fatigue and hot flashes. The first analysis of the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial (median follow-up, 33 months) demonstrated that in adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer, anastrozole was superior to tamoxifen in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), time to recurrence (TTR), and incidence of contralateral breast cancer (CLBC). in that endometrial cancer (P = 0.007), vaginal bleeding and discharge (P < 0.001 for both), cerebrovascular events (P < 0.001), venous thromboembolic events (P < 0.001), and hot flashes (P < 0.001) all occurred less frequently in the anastrozole group, whereas musculoskeletal disorders and fractures (P < 0.001 for both) continued to occur less frequently in the tamoxifen group. reduced nausea, hot flashes, and abdominal discomfort caused almost twice as many patients to prefer to continue with letrozole therapy than with anastrozole"
Can adult humans be induced to produce fetal hemoglobin?,yes,"At the time of birth, HbF accounts for approximately 70% of the total Hb.   whereas in the trace amounts of HbF that is found in the adult it reverses to 40:60 because of a gamma- to beta-globin gene switch With the increased understanding and discovery of molecular regulators of haemoglobin switching, such as BCL11A, new avenues of research may lead ultimately to novel therapeutic, mechanism-based approaches to fetal haemoglobin reactivation in patients. The data suggest that TGF-beta reactivates gamma-globin expression, combined with a sequential stimulation and suppression of erythropoiesis."
Isn't there a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns?,no,"In addition, unlike MNase, MPE-Fe(II) cleaves nuclear DNA with little sequence bias. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. Micrococcal nuclease does not substantially bias nucleosome mapping. MNase has hitherto been very widely used to map nucleosomes, although concerns have been raised over its potential to introduce bias. These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. Standardized collection of MNase-seq experiments enables unbiased dataset comparisons. Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the resulting fragments. We propose that combined MNase/exoIII digestion can be applied to in situ chromatin for unbiased genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positions that is not influenced by DNA sequences at the core/linker junctions. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant.. Micrococcal nuclease does not substantially bias nucleosome mapping. We find that maize MNase-hypersensitive (MNase HS) regions localize around active genes and within recombination hotspots, focusing biased gene conversion at their flanks."
Isn't PER3 required for CHK2 activation in human cells?,no,"Per3, a circadian gene, is required for Chk2 activation in human cells. Depletion of Per3 by siRNA almost completely abolished activation of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) after inducing DNA damage in human cells. Per3 overexpression induced Chk2 activation in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, Per3 overexpression also led to the inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death. These combined results suggest that Per3 is a checkpoint protein that plays important roles in checkpoint activation, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Depletion of Per3 by siRNA almost completely abolished activation of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) after inducing DNA damage in human cells Per3 overexpression induced Chk2 activation in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, and this activation depended on ATM In addition, Per3 physically interacted with ATM and Chk2"
Can't life style changes reduce oxidative stress,no,"The CFS group had an unfavorable lipid profile and signs of oxidative stress induced damage to lipids and proteins. These results might be indicative of early proatherogenic processes in this group of patients who are otherwise at low risk for atherosclerosis. Antioxidant treatment and life style changes are indicated for women with CFS, as well as closer observation in order to assess the degree of atherosclerosis. Once detected, these patients may be offered more aggressive treatment strategies such as early pharmacotherapy in addition to life style changes targeted to maintaining pericyte integrity. Our results suggested that life style changes which related to migration might reduce DNA damage in Hasake nationalities. Low levels of antioxidants and increased oxidative stress with insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome suggests that besides therapeutic life style changes (TLC) as suggested in ATP III guidelines inclusion of antioxidant vitamins, fruits and vegetable could be beneficial to ward off the consequences of metabolic syndrome."
Aren't the proteins Erbin (LAP2) and Merlin cooperating?,no,Erbin and the NF2 tumor suppressor Merlin cooperatively regulate cell-type-specific activation of PAK2 by TGF-beta. The results show that the epithelial-enriched protein Erbin controls the function of the NF2 tumor suppressor Merlin by determining the output of Merlin's physical interactions with active PAK2.  Erbin controls Merlin tumor suppressor function by switching the functional valence of PAK2 binding
Isn't human lysyl oxidase-like 2 a glycoprotein?,no,"This method was successfully applied to a novel recombinant protein, human lysyl oxidase-like 2. Furthermore, the glycosylation PTMs were readily detected at two glycosylation sites in the protein.  application to the characterization of human lysyl oxidase-like 2 glycosylation These results suggest that the N-glycan at Asn-644 of hLOXL2 enhances the solubility and stability of the LOX catalytic domain."
Is Kanzaki disease associated with deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase?,yes,"Kanzaki disease (OMIM#104170) is attributable to a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA; E.C.3.2.1.49), which hydrolyzes GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr.   Our findings suggest that the association of alpha-NAGA with its substrates is strongly affected by the amino acid substitution at R329 and that the association with GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr is more highly susceptible to structural changes. The residual mutant enzyme in R329W could not associate with GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr and GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser. However, the residual mutant enzyme in R329Q catalyzed GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser to some extent. Therefore, the urinary ratio of GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser:GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr was lower and the clinical phenotype was milder in the R329Q mutation.  Kanzaki disease (OMIM#104170) is attributable to a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA; E.C.3.2.1.49), which hydrolyzes GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr. Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA) deficiency (Schindler/Kanzaki disease) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous genetic disease with a wide spectrum including an early onset neuroaxonal dystrophy (Schindler disease) and late onset angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (Kanzaki disease). Structural and immunocytochemical studies on alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency (Schindler/Kanzaki disease). We describe the neurologic findings in a patient with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency (Kanzaki disease). Three dimensional structural studies of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA) in alpha-NAGA deficiency (Kanzaki disease): different gene mutations cause peculiar structural changes in alpha-NAGAs resulting in different substrate specificities and clinical phenotypes. alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA) deficiency is a rare hereditary lysosomal storage disease, and only three alpha-NAGA-deficient patients with angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (Kanzaki) have been described. Schindler disease and Kanzaki disease are caused by a deficient lysosomal enzyme, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (E.C.3.2.1.49). The 1.9 a structure of human alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase: The molecular basis of Schindler and Kanzaki diseases. These data suggest that a prototype of alpha-NAGA deficiency in Kanzaki disease and factors other than the defect of alpha-NAGA may contribute to severe neurological disorders, and Kanzaki disease is thought to be caused by a single enzyme deficiency. Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA) deficiency (Schindler/Kanzaki disease) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous genetic disease with a wide spectrum including an early onset neuroaxonal dystrophy (Schindler disease) and late onset angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (Kanzaki disease).  alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA) deficiency is a rare hereditary lysosomal storage disease, and only three alpha-NAGA-deficient patients with angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (Kanzaki) have been described.  Kanzaki disease (OMIM#104170) is attributable to a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA; E.C.3.2.1.49), which hydrolyzes GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr. Missense mutations, R329W or R329Q were identified in two Japanese Kanzaki patients.

Doesn't ghrelin play a role in ischemic stroke?,no,"Recent evidence suggests that ghrelin may also be neuroprotective after injury in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Overall, these experiments point to a neurodegenerative but antiapoptotic effect of endogenous ghrelin in this model of global ischemia, highlighting that further research is essential before we can apply ghrelin treatments to neurodegenerative insults in the clinic.  The serum ghrelin level was higher in the MCAO group when compared with the control group (P < 0.05).  Our results showed that higher level of serum ghrelin decreased gastrointestinal motility and damage to the intestinal mucosa existed in rats with MCAO. Leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin, new potential mediators of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin and ghrelin were confirmed in the stroke group. Ghrelin levels correlated mildly with triglyceride levels, and were dominant in men with cardioembolic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Adipokines and ghrelin play an important role in ischemic stroke, but their function in stroke subtypes seems to be different and sex influenced. Ghrelin suppresses inflammation and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in focal cerebral ischemia via the vagus nerve. Compared with vehicle treatment, human ghrelin treatment in vagus nerve-intact rats after MCAO showed marked reduction in neurological deficit by 57% and infarct size by 25%.  Human ghrelin treatment in vagus nerve-intact rats significantly decreased the above measurements. Human ghrelin treatment also improved 7-day survival and significantly decreased neurological deficit over the entire 7 days after MCAO in vagus nerve-intact rats compared with vehicle.  Human ghrelin is thus a neuroprotective agent that inhibits inflammation, nNOS activity, and apoptosis in focal cerebral ischemia through a vagal pathway. Ghrelin is known to promote neuronal defense and survival against ischemic injury by inhibiting apoptotic processes.  Our data indicate that des-acyl ghrelin, as well as ghrelin, protect cortical neurons against ischemic injury through the inhibition of Par-4 expression and apoptotic molecules in mitochondrial pathway. In conclusion, it is considered that ghrelin as well as S-100B can be a useful marker for the prediction of stoke after CPB.  Adipokines and ghrelin play an important role in ischemic stroke, but their function in stroke subtypes seems to be different and sex influenced. In this review we discuss pre-clinical evidence suggesting ghrelin may be a useful therapeutic in protecting the brain against injury after ischemic stroke. Both ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin protected cortical neurons from ischemic injury. Our data indicate that des-acyl ghrelin, as well as ghrelin, protect cortical neurons against ischemic injury through the inhibition of Par-4 expression and apoptotic molecules in mitochondrial pathway.

Doesn't surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?,no,"CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no contribution from surgery. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment. Amongst the 38 women desiring pregnancy after endometrioma surgery, 19 (50%) achieved a spontaneous pregnancy during the follow-up period.  Of 33 women who wished to conceive, 67% became pregnant, spontaneously in 59% CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence and pregnancy rates are encouraging in that they seem comparable to the best reported results after endometrioma cystectomy.  While laparoscopic excision is known to improve fertility, recurrence can cause significant ovarian damage and adverse affects on fertility. Surgery is considered to play a role within the framework of the therapeutic options to cure infertile women with the disease even though its effectiveness is generally modest.  Randomized controlled trials showed that the excision technique is associated with a higher pregnancy rate and a lower rate of recurrence although it may determine severe injury to the ovarian reserve.  Surgical treatment is associated with a high recurrence rate and its employment for women undergoing assisted conception has recently been challenged. Laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometrioma prior to IVF does not offer any additional benefit over expectant management.  For those women subsequently attempting to conceive it was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04-13.29). here is insufficient evidence to favour excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to the chance of pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination (OR 1.40 CI 0.47-4.15) .  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in a context of more than one year infertility only related to endometriosis, it is reasonable to offer these patients a complete operative laparoscopic treatment of their lesions, which enables 65% of them to be pregnant within a 8.5 months post-surgical median time to pregnancy and spontaneously in 60%.   It was also associated with a subsequent increased rate of spontaneous pregnancy women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04-13.29). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation, with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile.  Surgery is an option for treatment, but there is no convincing evidence that it promotes a significant improvement in fertility. In conclusion, ovarian surgery for the treatment of endometriosis reduces the ovarian outcome in IVF/ICSI cycles in women >35 years old, and might also decrease pregnancy rates.  Improvement of pain symptoms occurred in 87% of the patients and fertility rate was 45%. The long-term results, especially the fertility outcome, have been promising: 12 of 20 women (60%) achieved a term pregnancy following a laparoscopic endometrioma procedure alone.  Among this group, 115 patients (54%) conceived following surgery; of these conceptions, 109 resulted in a living child. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Despite the available evidence that surgery for endometriomas does not improve the outcome of ART and may damage ovarian reserve, it seems that the majority of gynaecologists in the UK offer ovarian cystectomy to their patients. Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility. Removal of endometriomas before in vitro fertilization does not improve fertility outcomes: a matched, case-control study. Conclusion(s): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes. Despite the available evidence that surgery for endometriomas does not improve the outcome of ART and may damage ovarian reserve, it seems that the majority of gynaecologists in the UK offer ovarian cystectomy to their patients. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins.

Do thyroid hormone receptors change after brain injury?,yes,"For example, the T3 receptor alpha was predominantly expressed in stroke-tissue, indicating that regeneration of nerves in stroke tissue may be facilitated by increased T3 receptor alpha expression. TRα expression was also increased in human infants with IVH.  Thus, in infants with IVH the combined elevation in deiodinase-3 and reduction in deiodinase-2 decreases TH signaling that can be worsened by an increase in unliganded TRα.  A rapid increase of the total number of binding sites for T3 appeared within 30 min of ischemia and reached over 40% by 3 h. During the same 3-h period, the relative binding affinity was reduced by 25%. Upon recirculation after 30 min or 3 h of ischemia, a rapid reversal of measured T3 binding sites occurred, which progressed to 20-30% below the control value by the recirculation period of 3 h."
Wasn't modafinil tested for schizophrenia treatment?,no,"Modafinil improves antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism but not excessive daytime sleepiness, psychiatric symptoms or cognition in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that modafinil was a safe adjunctive treatment which improved parkinsonian symptoms and signs in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  A review of its effects in schizophrenia suggests that modafinil facilitates cognitive functions, with pro-mnemonic effects and problem solving improvements. Emotional processing also appears to be enhanced by the drug, although to date there are only a limited number of studies. BACKGROUND: Modafinil, a putative cognitive enhancing drug, has previously been shown to improve performance of healthy volunteers as well as patients with attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia, mainly in tests of executive functions.  A review of modafinil and armodafinil as add-on therapy in antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia. It has been suggested that modafinil and its isomer armodafinil as an add-on strategy to antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia may improve cognitive functioning, attenuate fatigue, inactiveness and other negative functions as well as weight gain. Evidence for the use of modafinil or armodafinil as add-on therapy to antipsychotic drugs to alleviate fatigue, sleepiness and inactivity is inconclusive. One cohort study and one out of two single-dose crossover RCTs in which modafinil addition was studied could demonstrate a positive effect. All five RCTs of modafinil (three RCTs) and armodafinil (two RCTs) addition with a longer study duration could not demonstrate a positive effect.  In RCTs with a treatment duration of 4 weeks or more, however, no positive effect could be demonstrated on cognitive functioning with modafinil and armodafinil addition. Yet, four single-dose crossover RCTs of modafinil addition show significant positive effects on executive functioning, verbal memory span, visual memory, working memory, spatial planning, slowing in latency, impulse control and recognition of faces expressing sadness and sadness misattribution in the context of disgust recognition. The addition of modafinil or armodafinil to an antipsychotic regime, despite theoretical and preclinical considerations, has not been proved to enhance cognitive function, attenuate fatigue, enhance activity, improve negative symptoms and reduce weight in patients with schizophrenia. RATIONAL: In recent years, evidence suggests that modafinil may be useful for certain symptom domains of schizophrenia, especially for the negative and cognitive symptoms.  CONCLUSION: The present study indicates modafinil as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment of schizophrenia particularly the negative symptoms.  Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve attention, memory and executive function in the healthy population and in patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to counteract increased weight and metabolic diseases in patients taking clozapine. Modafinil (2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)acetamide) is described as an atypical stimulant and is a putative cognition enhancer for schizophrenia, but the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear. Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve emotion discrimination in healthy individuals and attention and executive function in schizophrenia.  CONCLUSIONS: These data support clinical evidence that modafinil may alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and also demonstrate the benefit of applying PLSR modeling to characterize functional brain networks in translational models relevant to central nervous system dysfunction. Modafinil improves working memory in healthy subjects and individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, though the effects of modafinil have not been evaluated on working memory in methamphetamine-dependent subjects. Modafinil is a psychostimulant approved for treating excessive sleepiness in adults; off-label uses (e.g., treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, ADHD and age-related dementias) are currently being explored.  CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to treat negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, or wakefulness/fatigue in patients on clozapine. We have previously shown that the amount of movement exhibited by patients with schizophrenia is positively correlated with the volume of left anterior cingulate cortex and that this quantity of movement can be increased by modafinil.  OBJECTIVE: Given recent reports about the off-label use of modafinil as an adjuvant for the treatment of antipsychotic-associated sedation in schizophrenia patients and the recent interest in its putative cognitive-enhancing effects in this population, we present a systematic review of available data on trials of modafinil as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive deficits, negative symptoms, and antipsychotic-induced fatigue, and its tolerability.  RESULTS: One of 4 reviewed studies found a significant effect of modafinil as an alerting agent for antipsychotic-induced fatigue and sedation. Neither of 2 reviewed studies found modafinil to improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Three of 6 reviewed studies showed that modafinil may improve short-term memory, attention, and the ability to shift mental sets.  CONCLUSIONS: While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia.  Hence, before prescribing modafinil to a schizophrenia patient, the possible risks and benefits of each particular case should be evaluated. Modafinil had a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness and depression in patients with traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-polio fatigue and multiple sclerosis; however, it did not provide any benefit greater than placebo. RATIONALE: The wake-promoting agent modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance in healthy volunteers, in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in schizophrenia.  Recently, however, modafinil has been shown to improve attentional set-shifting performance in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, modafinil shows initial promise for a variety of off-label indications in psychiatry, including treatment-resistant depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. There is increasing interest in the use of modafinil to improve cognition in schizophrenia as well as in other disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Initial findings indicate that modafinil may lead to better executive functioning and attentional performance in patients with schizophrenia.  CONCLUSIONS: Although no effect on negative symptoms was found, adjunctive therapy with modafinil may result in global improvements in patients with schizophrenia who have prominent negative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil did not improve cognitive control in all schizophrenia patients. . These data suggest that modafinil increases quantifiable motor behaviour in schizophrenia and may have an impact on avolition. One patient was on treatment with both modafinil and trazodone and reported no change after tapering each in separate discontinuation trials, while another 3 patients were taking sleeping medications and also noted no change after discontinuation.  Neuroprotective agents as add-on therapies (e.g., modafinil, erythropoietin, glycine, D-serine, memantine and celecoxib) are currently being evaluated in schizophrenia and related disorders.  In the modafinil (N = 10) and placebo (N = 10) groups, fatigue improved significantly over time (p < .01), but there were no differences between groups on changes in fatigue, positive and negative symptoms, or cognition.  CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil modulates anterior cingulate cortex function in chronic schizophrenia but its beneficial cognitive effects may be restricted to a subset of patients requiring further characterisation. Modafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition, with 64% and 82% of patients rated as clinically improved at week 4 by a blinded clinician and the investigator respectively. Modafinil significantly improved fatigue (P = 0.025, week 3) and tended to improve cognitive functioning scores.  Although preliminary, these results suggest modafinil may be an effective and well-tolerated adjunct treatment that improves global functioning and clinical condition, and reduces fatigue in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Modafinil had some cognitive enhancing properties in schizophrenia similar to those observed in healthy adults and adult patients with ADHD.  Modafinil may have potential as an important therapy for cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, particularly because of its beneficial effects on attentional set shifting. While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia. Given recent reports about the off-label use of modafinil as an adjuvant for the treatment of antipsychotic-associated sedation in schizophrenia patients and the recent interest in its putative cognitive-enhancing effects in this population, we present a systematic review of available data on trials of modafinil as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive deficits, negative symptoms, and antipsychotic-induced fatigue, and its tolerability.

Can't beans induce apoptosis?,no,"A 60-kDa glucosamine binding lectin, white kidney bean lectin (WKBL), was purified from Phaseolus vulgaris cv. white kidney beans, by application of anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, and FPLC-size exclusion on Superdex 75. The anti-proliferative activity of WKBL on HONE1 cells and HepG2 cells was stronger than the activity on MCF7 cells and WRL68 cells  Treatment of human stomach cancer KATO III cells with hot-water extracts from adzuki beans led to their growth inhibition as well as apoptosis induction. Stimulation of dendritic cell maturation and induction of apoptosis in leukemia cells by a heat-stable extract from azuki bean (Vigna angularis), a promising immunopotentiating food and dietary supplement for cancer prevention. Human gut flora-fermented nondigestible fraction from cooked bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) modifies protein expression associated with apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferation in human adenocarcinoma colon cancer cells. This paper reports the effect of fermentation products (FP) by hgf (FP-hgf) from NDF of cooked beans on survival and protein expression associated with apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferation in human adenocarcinoma colon cancer cells. PHA-E is a natural product extracted from red kidney beans, and it has been reported to induce cell apoptosis by blocking EGFR in lung cancer cells A Glucosamine-Specific Lectin from Green Dragon No. 8 Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) Induced Apoptosis on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells PHA-E is a natural product extracted from red kidney beans, and it has been reported to induce cell apoptosis by blocking EGFR in lung cancer cells. The anticancer activity of δ-tocotrienol, a bioactive vitamin E present in whole grain cereals, annatto beans and palm fruit, is strongly dependent on its effect on the induction of apoptosis. δ-Tocotrienol-induced apoptosis is associated with consistent induction in the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). NDF of cooked common beans inhibited colon carcinogenesis at an early stage by inducing cell cycle arrest of colon cells and morphological changes linked to apoptosis, thus confirming previous results obtained with gene expression studies. Azuki extract also inhibited the growth of human leukemia U937 cells, leading to induction of apoptosis. Fermentation product of soybean, black bean, and green bean mixture induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer cells. A non-digestible fraction of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis during early carcinogenesis."
Is triadin involved in cardiac function?,yes,"Junctin (JCN), a 26-kd sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein, forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin in the SR lumen of cardiac muscle. Within this complex, calsequestrin, triadin, and JCN appear to be critical for normal regulation of ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium (Ca) release. Recent studies have uncovered functional roles of both JCN and triadin in the mouse heart, using transgenic overexpression strategies, which exhibit varying phenotypes including mild SR structural alterations, prolongation of Ca transient decay, impaired relaxation, and cardiac hypertrophy and/or heart failure. Triadin is involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.  Thus the maintenance of triadin expression is essential for normal SR Ca cycling and contractile function. Ca2+ release from the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is regulated by a complex of proteins, including the ryanodine receptor (RyR), calsequestrin (CSQ), junctin (JCN), and triadin 1 (TRD). Impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release has been suggested to contribute to the depressed cardiac function in heart failure. The release of Ca from the SR may be regulated by the ryanodine receptor, triadin, junctin, calsequestrin, and a histidine-rich, Ca-binding protein (HRC)."

Isn't there any research that relates the function of Notch Signaling with Alzheimer Disease?,no,"RIP regulates signaling pathways by abrogating or releasing signaling molecules. Since the discovery, already >15 years ago, of its catalytic component, presenilin, and even much earlier with the identification of amyloid precursor protein as its first substrate, γ-secretase has been commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, starting with Notch and thereafter a continuously increasing number of novel substrates, γ-secretase is becoming linked to an equally broader range of biological processes. In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates. This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory. In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injury Along with β-secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid β-protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the amyloid β-protein precursor. Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, γ-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed. The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that γ-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure High physiological concentrations of Aβ monomer induced angiogenesis by a conserved mechanism that blocks γ-secretase processing of a Notch intermediate, NEXT, and reduces the expression of downstream Notch target genes. Our findings allude to an integration of signaling pathways that utilize γ-secretase activity, which may have significant implications for our understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis vis-à-vis vascular changes that set the stage for ensuing neurodegeneration. Aggregated forms of Aβ have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer disease and, thus, reducing the Aβ levels by inhibiting γ-secretase is a possible treatment strategy for Alzheimer disease. Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of γ-secretase results in Notch-related side effects. Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch. Nicastrin (Nct) is part of the γ-secretase complex and has been proposed to be involved in substrate recognition and selection"
Isn't PUVA therapy indicated for eczema treatment?,no,"With bath PUVA treatment, the best results were found in patients with hyperkeratotic eczema (17/22; 77% good clinical response) followed by patients with palmoplantar psoriasis (26/41; 63%) and patients with dyshidrotic eczema (8/16; 50%).  Oral vs. bath PUVA using 8-methoxypsoralen for chronic palmoplantar eczema. Both oral and bath PUVA with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema.  Oral PUVA is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema and bath PUVA for patients with dyshidrotic eczema. Treatment of hand eczema is dominated by the administration of topical glucocorticosteriods. If topical treatment fails, the best second-line option is ultraviolet (UV) therapy alone or as combination therapy. UVB and PUVA (psoralen plus UVA) therapy is effective and has relatively few side effects.  Although local PUVA has been proven to be effective in the treatment of chronic hand eczema, little is known about the efficacy and safety of local narrowband UVB (TL-01) for this condition. Local narrowband UVB phototherapy regimen is as effective as paint-PUVA therapy in patients with chronic hand eczema of dry and dyshidrotic types. Smoking is likely to be a reason for the failure of bath-PUVA therapy in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema, in particular regarding smokers with eczema of the dyshidrotic type where no complete remission was achieved. Treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema with local bath-PUVA therapy. Bath-PUVA therapy has been described as successful treatment for palmoplantar eczema. Systemic PUVA therapy may be useful in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema. A new psoralen-containing gel for topical PUVA therapy: development, and treatment results in patients with palmoplantar and plaque-type psoriasis, and hyperkeratotic eczema. These results indicate that topical PUVA therapy with psoralen in aqueous gel is a useful therapeutic modality for treatment of psoriasis patients, and patients with recalcitrant dermatoses such as palmoplantar psoriasis and hyperkeratotic eczema. In order to evaluate environmental influences possibly having an impact on the efficacy of this therapy, smokers and non-smokers suffering from palmoplantar eczema treated with bath-PUVA therapy were compared. Does smoking influence the efficacy of bath-PUVA therapy in chronic palmoplantar eczema? PUVA therapy caused acute aggravation of the eczema. Hyperkeratotic eczema cleared significantly better with oral than with bath PUVA (P=0.03).CONCLUSION: Oral PUVA is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema and bath PUVA for patients with dyshidrotic eczema. BACKGROUND: Systemic PUVA therapy may be useful in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema. These results indicate that topical PUVA therapy with psoralen in aqueous gel is a useful therapeutic modality for treatment of psoriasis patients, and patients with recalcitrant dermatoses such as palmoplantar psoriasis and hyperkeratotic eczema.

Does smoking influence the efficacy of bath-PUVA therapy in chronic palmoplantar eczema? Local bath-PUVA therapy is of value in the management of chronic palmoplantar eczema resistant to standard modes of topical treatment. However, few data are available on the effectiveness of local bath-PUVA therapy in palmoplantar eczema. A new psoralen-containing gel for topical PUVA therapy: development, and treatment results in patients with palmoplantar and plaque-type psoriasis, and hyperkeratotic eczema. Smoking is likely to be a reason for the failure of bath-PUVA therapy in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema, in particular regarding smokers with eczema of the dyshidrotic type where no complete remission was achieved.. In order to investigate the effectiveness of topical PUVA-bath therapy (PUVA-soak therapy) on chronic palmoplantar dermatoses, 30 patients with plaque-type psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, endogenous eczema, dyshidrotic eczema and hyperkeratotic dermatitis of the palms and soles were treated over 8 weeks with PUVA-soak using 8-MOP. Our purpose was to assess the effectiveness of local bath-PUVA therapy in 28 patients with chronic palmar or plantar eczema or both who were resistant to conventional topical treatment."
Doesn't oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,yes,"Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer. We propose that single-stranded DNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed SNS mutator phenotype."
Can siRNA affect response to afatinib treatment?,yes,"On the other hand, miR-146a enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation by drugs targeting EGFR, including both TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) and a monoclonal antibody (cetuximab) These effects were independent of the EGFR mutation status (wild type, sensitizing mutation or resistance mutation), but were less potent compared to the effects of siRNA targeting of EGFR Among the anti-EGFR agents tested, the strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with T790M-specific-siRNAs The combination of a potent, irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib, with T790M-specific-siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer containing the resistant T790M mutation. The strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with an EGFR-specific siRNA The addition of EGFR siRNA to either TKIs or cetuximab additively enhanced growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in all five cell lines, independent of the EGFR mutation status (wild-type or sensitizing mutation or resistant mutation). The combination of a potent, irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib, with EGFR-specific siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer and other EGFR dependent cancers, including those with downstream resistance mutations."
Could the Menzerath-Altmann law be proved mathematically trivial in genomes?,yes,"Here we review the statistical foundations of that test and consider three non-parametric tests based upon different correlation metrics and one parametric test to evaluate if Z ∼ 1/X in genomes. The most powerful test is a new non-parametric one based upon the correlation ratio, which is able to reject Z ∼ 1/X in nine out of 11 taxonomic groups and detect a borderline group. Rather than a fact, Z ∼ 1/X is a baseline that real genomes do not meet. The view of Menzerath-Altmann law as inevitable is seriously flawed.

Is transcription of eRNA bidirectional?,yes,"In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), which codes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a well-known AR-regulated gene and its upstream enhancers produce bidirectional enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), termed KLK3e. The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone α-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity.  A richer picture has taken shape, integrating transcription of coding genes, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), and various other noncoding transcriptional events. In this review we give an overview of recent studies detailing the mechanisms of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II)-based transcriptional initiation and discuss the ways in which transcriptional direction is established as well as its functional implications. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone α-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity. Using this approach, we have defined a class of primary transcripts (eRNAs) that are transcribed uni- or bidirectionally from estrogen receptor binding sites (ERBSs) with an average transcription unit length of ∼3-5 kb. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. We identify 76 enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), 40 canonical lncRNAs, 65 antisense lncRNAs and 35 regions of bidirectional transcription (RBT) that are differentially expressed in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. Instead, communication between promoters and enhancers can be bidirectional with promoters required to activate enhancer transcription. A new paradigm has emerged in recent years characterizing transcription initiation as a bidirectional process encompassing a larger proportion of the genome than previously thought."
Isn't pregabalin effective for treatment of patients with restless leg syndrome?,no,"CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated improvements in objective and subjective measures of sleep maintenance and sleep architecture with pregabalin compared with placebo and pramipexole. Effects of pregabalin on periodic limb movement arousal index were comparable to pramipexole.  CONCLUSIONS: Pregabalin provided significantly improved treatment outcomes as compared with placebo, and augmentation rates were significantly lower with pregabalin than with 0.5 mg of pramipexole. The alpha-2-delta ligands, including gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin, are effective for RLS without known occurrence of augmentation or impulse control disorders, although sedation and dizziness can occur.  Pregabalin has been established as effective for up to 1 year in treating RLS/WED (Level A evidence).  In the group of anticonvulsants, only the trials performed with α₂δ ligands such as gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin showed good efficacy.  Alternative or additional pharmacologic treatment with a lower level of overall quality of evidence includes opioids (codeine, tramadol, and oxycodone) and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin).  There is sufficient evidence to conclude that dopamine agonists such as rotigotine transdermal patch, pramipexole, ropinirole, gabapentin enacarbil, pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in the short-term treatment of RLS and rotigotine, followed by gabapentin enacarbil, ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin for long-term treatment. Calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin) provide alternative therapies for RLS especially in patients with augmentation, impulse control disorders, or hypersomnia induced by dopamine agonists.  Alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin, and pregabalin) increased the number of IRLS responders (RR=1.66; [95% CI: 1.33 to 2.09], k=3, high strength of evidence) and mean change in IRLS symptom scores (k=3, high strength of evidence).  RECOMMENDATIONS: Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment for RLS. Therapies with an OPTION level of recommendation include carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, clonidine, and for patients with low ferritin levels, iron supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-week phase 2b study, pregabalin reduced RLS symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe idiopathic RLS CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that pregabalin is effective for the treatment of restless legs syndrome and improves sleep architecture and periodic limb movements in placebo-unresponsive patients. In severe, refractory or neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used. The alpha-2-delta ligands, including gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin, are effective for RLS without known occurrence of augmentation or impulse control disorders, although sedation and dizziness can occur This study provides Class II evidence that pregabalin is effective for the treatment of restless legs syndrome and improves sleep architecture and periodic limb movements in placebo-unresponsive patients.

Has single guide RNA been used on human cells?,yes,"We used a library containing 73,000 sgRNAs to generate knockout collections and performed screens in two human cell lines. Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA). The type II CRISPR/Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes and its simplified derivative, the Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) system, have emerged as potent new tools for targeted gene knockout in bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish and human cells. Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA).  Using synthetic single RNA guides, Cas9 can be reprogrammed to create specific double-stranded DNA breaks in the genomes of a variety of organisms, ranging from human cells to bacteria, and thus constitutes a powerful tool for genetic engineering.  Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA)."
Isn't cilengitide effective for treatment of glioblastoma?,yes,"RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). However, we could not conclusively confirm whether cilengitide 2000mg/5/week was the optimum regime, as only one trial using this protocol was included in our study. Cilengitide (CGT) is a cyclic pentapeptide that demonstrated efficacy for GBM treatment by targeting the integrins avβ3 and avβ5 over-expressed on GBM cells. Cilengitide is recently failed in Phase III CENTRIC trial in unselected patients with GBM. In conclusion, we demonstrate that EGFRvIII/integrin β3 complexes promote GBM progression and metastasis in the environment of hypoxia and vitronectin-enrichment, and cilengitide may serve as a promising therapeutics for EGFRvIII-positive GBMs. he addition of molecularly targeted drugs to TEM + RAD did not improve the OS of patients with GBM; however, it did improve PFS in patients treated by cilengitide who could not get improvement in OS.   The randomized phase III CENTRIC and phase II CORE trials explored the integrin inhibitor cilengitide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with versus without O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. These trials failed to meet their primary endpoints . In CORE, higher αvβ3 levels in tumor cells were associated with improved progression-free survival by central review and with improved overall survival in patients treated with cilengitide. Cilengitide combined with metronomic temozolomide and procarbazine in MGMT-promoter unmethylated glioblastoma did not improve survival compared with historical data and does not warrant further investigation. The addition of cilengitide to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy did not improve outcomes; cilengitide will not be further developed as an anticancer drug. Cilengitide treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients does not alter patterns of progression. It may be proposed that the combination therapy of NG2 suppression and cilengitide treatment showed no considerable effect on glioblastoma compared to cilengitide therapy alone."

This gene is co-expressed with a number of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, including SDH1-1, and has low partial sequence similarity to human SDHAF2, a protein required for flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) insertion into SDH."
Can't doxycycline cause photosensitivity?,no,"Phototoxicity of Doxycycline: A Systematic Review on Clinical Manifestations, Frequency, Cofactors, and Prevention. BACKGROUND: One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity.  While there are many publications on the phototoxicity of tetracyclines in general, only a few exist focusing on doxycycline.  Clinical symptoms vary from light sunburn-like sensation (burning, erythema) to large-area photodermatitis.  CONCLUSION: Evidence base must be improved for giving advice on appropriate prevention measures to travelers taking doxycycline and having a risk of significant sun exposure. Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush. Many drugs are responsible for this phototoxic reaction, especially tetracyclines, psoralens, chloramphenicol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluoroquinolones, and, rarely, doxycycline.  OBJECTIVES: Many patients undergoing long-term doxycycline treatment do not regularly take their treatment because of photosensitivity. Modulation of Melanogenesis and Antioxidant Status of Melanocytes in Response to Phototoxic Action of Doxycycline. Doxycycline is a commonly used tetracycline antibiotic showing the broad spectrum of antibacterial action. However, the use of this antibiotic is often connected with the risk of phototoxic reactions that lead to various skin disorders. The results obtained in vitro may explain the mechanisms of phototoxic reactions that occur in normal human epidermal melanocytes in vivo after exposure of skin to doxycycline and UVA radiation. Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone.<br> <b>OBJECTIVES</b>: Many patients undergoing long-term doxycycline treatment do not regularly take their treatment because of photosensitivity. Photosensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted more often among patients receiving doxycycline than in those receiving ceftriaxone. Thus, the action spectra of the drug photosensitivity patients were plotted and compared with those of 12 nonphotosensitive control patients: 10 patients were found to be photosensitive in the UVA range; the implicated drugs included quinine, sparfloxacin, amiodarone, doxycycline, mefenamic acid, nalidixic acid, fenbrufen, diclofenac, enalapril, diltiazem and prochlorperazine maleate. One patient on doxycycline was photosensitive in both the UVA and UVB ranges. Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone. Anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines or increased photosensitivity, or by pregnant or nursing women (anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline is a pregnancy category-D medication). <b>BACKGROUND</b>: One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity. One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity. One patient experienced mild photosensitivity from doxycycline but continued to take it. Participants in the doxycycline group had a higher incidence of nausea and photosensitivity. Photosensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted more often among patients receiving doxycycline than in those receiving ceftriaxone."
Are circRNAs associated with diseases and traits?,yes,"Circ2Traits: a comprehensive database for circular RNA potentially associated with disease and traits. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being associated with a disease was calculated Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit aberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases In this paper we studied the potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being associated with a disease was calculated.

Isn't there any link between ERCC1-XPF and cohesin?,no,"ERCC1-XPF cooperates with CTCF and cohesin to facilitate the developmental silencing of imprinted genes. Using an in vivo biotinylation tagging approach in mice, we show that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) structure-specific endonuclease ERCC1-XPF complex interacts with the insulator binding protein CTCF, the cohesin subunits SMC1A and SMC3 and with MBD2; the factors co-localize with ATRX at the promoters and control regions (ICRs) of imprinted genes during postnatal hepatic development. Loss of Ercc1 or exposure to MMC triggers the localization of CTCF to heterochromatin, the dissociation of the CTCF-cohesin complex and ATRX from promoters and ICRs, altered histone marks and the aberrant developmental expression of imprinted genes without altering DNA methylation. We propose that ERCC1-XPF cooperates with CTCF and cohesin to facilitate the developmental silencing of imprinted genes and that persistent DNA damage triggers chromatin changes that affect gene expression programs associated with NER disorders.

Is tubulin acetylation involved in cell motility?,yes,"In this study, we found that paclitaxel induced tubulin acetylation in endothelial and tumor cells, at concentrations that affected cell motility but not proliferation (10(-8) to 10(-9) M, for 4 hours). Induction of tubulin acetylation correlated with inhibition of motility but not proliferation based on a comparison of highly and poorly cytotoxic taxanes (paclitaxel and IDN5390) and tumor cell lines sensitive and resistant to paclitaxel (1A9 and 1A9 PTX22). we found that overexpression of the tubulin deacetylase SIRT2 increased cell motility and reduced cell response to the anti-motility activity of paclitaxel. Conversely, the SIRT2 inhibitor splitomicin reduced cell motility and potentiated the anti-motility activity of paclitaxel. The inhibitory effect was further potentiated by the addition of the HDAC6 inhibitor trichostatin A. Cell motility and adhesion involves dynamic microtubule (MT) acetylation/deacetylation, a process regulated by enzymes as HDAC6, a major cytoplasmic α-tubulin deacetylase. GRK2 and HDAC6 colocalize in the lamellipodia of migrating cells, leading to local tubulin deacetylation and enhanced motility. This review highlights the emerging roles of tubulin acetylation in multiple cellular functions, ranging from cell motility, cell cycle progression or cell differentiation to intracellular trafficking and signalling. Our results indicate that TPPP/p25 binds to HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6), an enzyme responsible for tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the direct interaction of these two proteins resulted in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. Finally, we demonstrated that, similarly to other HDAC6 inhibitors, TPPP/p25 influences the microtubule dynamics by decreasing the growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and also affects cell motility as demonstrated by time lapse video experiments. ""tubacin,"" which inhibits alpha-tubulin deacetylation in mammalian cells. We provide evidence that class II histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is the intracellular target of tubacin. Tubacin treatment did not affect the stability of microtubules but did decrease cell motility. They also suggest that small molecules that selectively inhibit HDAC6-mediated alpha-tubulin deacetylation, a first example of which is tubacin, might have therapeutic applications as antimetastatic and antiangiogenic agents. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 promotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. HDAC6 is a major cytoplasmic a-tubulin deacetylase that is involved in cell motility and adhesion. GRK2 dynamically and directly associates with and phosphorylates HDAC6 to stimulate its a-tubulin deacetylase activity at specific cellular localizations, such as the leading edge of migrating cells, thus promoting local tubulin deacetylation and enhanced motility."
Is Marfan syndrome associated with chordal rupture?,yes,"Repair of the mitral valve in children who have Marfan syndrome is especially difficult due to the presence of generalized connective tissue disorder, which may lead to future elongation and rupture of chordae tendineae that were unaffected at the time of mitral valve repair.

Perioperative coronary artery spasm in modified Bentall's operation for annulo-aortic ectasia in Marfan's syndrome. A case report of perioperative chordal rupture of the mitral valve. In a modified Bentall's operation (button technique), perioperative severe coronary artery spasm occurred in spite of the preventive use of nitroglycerin infusion, which resulted in profound ventricular fibrillation and subsequent chordal rupture of the mitral valve with Sellers IV regurgitation. It is worthy to report this case because of rarities such as Marfan's syndrome accompanied by Prinzmetal's variant angina, perioperative coronary artery spasm in modified Bentall's operation, and perioperative chordal rupture of the mitral valve and progression of mitral valve regurgitation.   The four Major Complications- sudden death, infective endocarditis, spontaneous rupture of chordae tendineae, and progressive mitral regurgitation- are examined.

Optogenetic methods have emerged as a powerful tool for elucidating neural circuit activity underlying a diverse set of behaviors across a broad range of species. Optogenetic tools of microbial origin consist of light-sensitive membrane proteins that are able to activate (e.g., channelrhodopsin-2, ChR2) or silence (e.g., halorhodopsin, NpHR) neural activity ingenetically-defined cell types over behaviorally-relevant timescales.  Virus-mediated expression of a ChR2 variant with greater light sensitivity in SGNs reduced the amount of light required for responses and allowed neuronal spiking following stimulation up to 60 Hz.  Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii functions as a light-gated cation channel that has been developed as an optogenetic tool to stimulate specific nerve cells in animals and control their behavior by illumination.  Here, we used animal models to characterize optogenetic stimulation, which is the optical stimulation of neurons genetically engineered to express the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2).  The versatility and the electrophysiologic characteristics of the light-sensitive ion-channels channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), halorhodopsin (NpHR), and the light-sensitive proton pump archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) make these optogenetic tools potent candidates in controlling neuronal firing in models of epilepsy and in providing insights into the physiology and pathology of neuronal network organization and synchronization. The most widely used optogenetic tool, Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2), is both light- and voltage-sensitive. A light-triggered action potential or light-driven perturbations of ongoing electrical activity provide instant voltage feedback, shaping ChR2 current.

Channelrhodospin-2 (ChR2), a light-sensitive ion channel, and its variants have emerged as new excitatory optogenetic tools not only in neuroscience, but also in other areas, including cardiac electrophysiology. It allows neurons to express light-sensitive genes that enable the identification, dissection, and manipulation of specific neural populations and their connections in the tissues and organs of awake animals with unprecedented spatial and temporal precision. Light-sensitive genes chiefly including the genetically targeted light-gated channels channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR) cause intracellular ion flow during optical illumination. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii functions as a light-gated cation channel that has been developed as an optogenetic tool to stimulate specific nerve cells in animals and control their behavior by illumination. The molecular mechanism of ChR2 has been extensively studied by a variety of spectroscopic methods, including light-induced difference Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which is sensitive to structural changes in the protein upon light activation."
Isn't tirilazad effective for treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage?,yes,"There was no significant difference between the two groups at the end of follow up for the primary outcome, death (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06), or in poor outcome (death, vegetative state or severe disability) (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21). During the treatment period, fewer patients developed delayed cerebral ischaemia in the tirilazad group than in the control group (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.93). Subgroup analyses did not demonstrate any significant difference in effects of tirilazad on clinical outcomes.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that tirilazad, in addition to nimodipine, reduces mortality or improves poor outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH. This clinical trial suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day, improves overall outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. Tirilazad is ineffective.There are many possible successful treatment options for preventing vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, and poor neurologic outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, further multicenter RCTs need to be performed to determine if there is a significant benefit from their use Findings from previous multicenter clinical trials have suggested that tirilazad mesylate, a synthetic nonhormonal 21-aminosteroid, might be effective in preventing delayed cerebral ischemia following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This clinical trial suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day, improves overall outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients."
Isn't Drk essential for anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) in Drosophila?,no,"Anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) was described decades ago, but the mechanisms that underlie this protein synthesis-independent form of consolidated memory inDrosophilaremain poorly understood. Whether the several signaling molecules, receptors, and synaptic proteins currently implicated in ARM operate in one or more pathways and how they function in the process remain unclear. We present evidence that Drk, theDrosophilaortholog of the adaptor protein Grb2, is essential for ARM within adult mushroom body neurons. We present evidence that Drk, the Drosophila ortholog of the adaptor protein Grb2, is essential for ARM within adult mushroom body neurons."
Does Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) show a bias for highly expressed loci?,yes,"However, several issues in the processing and analysis of ChIP-chip data have not been resolved fully, including the effect of background (mock control) subtraction and normalization within and across arrays  Proper normalization is essential for ChIP-chip experiments. The proposed normalization technique can correct systematic errors and compensate for the lack of mock control data, thus reducing the experimental cost and producing more accurate results. Subtraction of the mock (non-specific antibody or no antibody) control data is generally needed to eliminate the bias, but appropriate normalization obviates the need for mock experiments and increases the correlation among replicates The proposed method can handle several control samples allowing for correction of multiple sources of bias simultaneously However, the data generated will always contain noise due to e.g. repetitive regions or non-specific antibody interactions The generation of high copy numbers of DNA fragments as an artifact of the PCR step in ChIP-seq is an important source of bias of this methodology Here we describe several technical aspects of the ChIP-Seq assay that diminish bias and background noise and allow the consistent generation of high-quality data  This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques We detected a chromatin-state bias: open chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not corrected This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any base-composition bias This problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because of the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods We investigated the impact of library amplification bias on the identification of allele-specific (AS) molecular events from high-throughput sequencing data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-seq) The 238 loci, termed ""hyper-ChIPable"", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations"
Isn't poly (ADP- ribosylation) involved in transcriptional control?,no,"Histone phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, SUMOylation and poly-ADP-ribosylation, as well as ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes, play equally pivotal roles in the maintenance of transcriptional fidelity oly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1; EC 2.4.2.30) is an abundant nuclear protein that is involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, programmed cell death and transcriptional regulation. Many lines of evidence suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp-1) is involved in transcriptional regulation of various genes as a coactivator or a corepressor by modulating chromatin structure These results suggest that Parp-1 is required to maintain transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of genes on a genome-wide scale PARP-1 was identified as a part of the mH2A1.1 nucleosome complex and was found to be associated with the Hsp70.1 promoter Upon heat shock, the Hsp70.1 promoter-bound PARP-1 is released to activate transcription through ADP-ribosylation of other Hsp70.1 promoter-bound proteins Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited 75% of PAP gene induction and 4-hydroxyquinazolone, the highly specific inhibitor of the enzyme, blocked almost completely PAP expression, suggesting that ADP-ribosylation was indeed required for the upregulation of PAP gene expression by cycloheximide  inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase suppressed UV-induced HIV-1 gene expression but not tat-mediated expression oly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors suppress UV-induced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression"
Is there any tool that facilitates the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish?,yes,"Zebrafish enhancer detection (ZED) vector: a new tool to facilitate transgenesis and the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish. he cis-regulatory sequences control when, where, and how much genes are transcribed and can activate (enhancers) or repress (silencers) gene expression. Here, we describe a novel Tol2 transposon-based vector for assessing enhancer activity in the zebrafish (Danio rerio). This Zebrafish Enhancer Detector (ZED) vector harbors several key improvements, among them a sensitive and specific minimal promoter chosen for optimal enhancer activity detection, insulator sequences to shield the minimal promoter from position effects, and a positive control for transgenesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that highly conserved noncoding sequences homologous between humans and zebrafish largely with enhancer activity largely retain their tissue-specific enhancer activity during vertebrate evolution. More strikingly, insulator sequences from mouse and chicken, but not conserved in zebrafish, maintain their insulator capacity when tested in this model.

Doesn't amiodarone affect thyroid hormone receptors in the myocardium?,no,"AM and Dron affected TR expression in the RA similarly by decreasing TRalpha 1 and beta 1 expression by about 50% In the LVW, AM and Dron decreased TRbeta 1 and, interestingly, AM increased TRalpha 1. n the apex, AM also increased TRalpha 2. Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in comparison to the control. amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse myocardium in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed no change in the expression of the ThR protein. Amiodarone and T3, respectively, downregulated T3R alpha 1, T3R beta 1, T3R beta 2 (p < 0.05), but did not affect the levels of T3R alpha 2. Amiodarone and T3, added together, upregulated T3R alpha 2 and T3R beta 1 (p < 0.05) as compared to amiodarone or T3 alone."
Isn't macroautophagy a selective degradation process?,no,"Selective autophagy Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a bulk degradation system for cytoplasmic components and is ubiquitously found in eukaryotic cells Here we show that selective autophagy downregulates Ty1 transposition We propose that selective autophagy safeguards genome integrity against excessive insertional mutagenesis caused during nutrient starvation by transposable elements in eukaryotic cells. Moreover, it is becoming apparent that proteins, organelles, and pathogens can be targeted for autophagic clearance by selective mechanisms Cell spreading required ref(2)P, the Drosophila p62 multiadaptor, implicating selective autophagy as a novel mechanism for modulating cortical dynamics The selective macroautophagic degradation There is growing evidence that macroautophagic cargo is not limited to bulk cytosol in response to starvation and can occur selectively for substrates, including aggregated proteins. It remains unclear, however, whether starvation-induced and selective macroautophagy share identical adaptor molecules to capture their cargo. Here, we report that Alfy, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein, is central to the selective elimination of aggregated proteins. We propose that Alfy plays a key role in selective macroautophagy by bridging cargo to the molecular machinery that builds autophagosomes. Thus, cytoplasmic NBR1 might be important to maintain basal levels of selective macroautophagy in these neurons. we could show that Smatg8 and Smatg4 are not only required for nonselective macroautophagy, but for selective macropexophagy as well. The latter is performed by proteasome-mediated degradation, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and selective macroautophagy, Here we demonstrate a role for PtdIns 4-kinases and PtdIns4P 5-kinases in selective and nonselective types of autophagy in yeast. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a degradative cellular pathway that protects eukaryotic cells from stress, starvation, and microbial infection. Previously, we showed that macroautophagy is necessary for conidiation in the rice-blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we analyzed the physiological function(s) of selective autophagy in Magnaporthe Serine 403 phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 regulates selective autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins. Selective macroautophagy (autophagy) of ubiquitinated protein is implicated as a compensatory mechanism of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. p62/SQSTM1 is a key molecule managing autophagic clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins. Whole organelle turnover is mediated through macroautophagy, a process by which autophagosomes deliver mitochondria to the lysosome for hydrolytic degradation. While mitochondrial autophagy can occur as part of a nonselective upregulation of autophagy, selective degradation of damaged or unneeded mitochondria (mitophagy) is a rapidly growing area in development, cancer, and neurodegeneration, particularly with regard to Parkinson's disease BAG3 was recently described as a mediator of a novel macroautophagy pathway that uses the specificity of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) to misfolded proteins and also involves other protein partners, such as HSPB8. two Parkinson disease (PD) associated genes, PINK1 and Parkin, were shown to mediate the degradation of damaged mitochondria via selective autophagy (mitophagy) Here we show that whole mitochondria are turned over via macroautophagy. Does Huntingtin play a role in selective macroautophagy? In the discussion here I suggest that Htt may have a normal function in the lysosomal mechanism of selective macroautophagy involved in its own degradation Macroautophagy induced by ethanol seemed to be selective for damaged mitochondria and accumulated lipid droplets, but not long-lived proteins, which could account for its protective effects Although macroautophagy can be nonspecific, there are many examples of selective sequestration including pexophagy, mitophagy and the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. Mitochondria autophagy (mitophagy) is the process of selective degradation of mitochondria that has an important role in mitochondrial quality control. One of the genes identified, YLR356W, is required for mitophagy, but not for macroautophagy or other types of selective autophagy. A genomic screen for yeast mutants defective in selective mitochondria autophagy. Mitophagy is the process of selective mitochondrial degradation via autophagy, which has an important role in mitochondrial quality control. Analysis of this set of targeted deletion mutants demonstrated that loss of any of the 16 genes necessary for nonselective macroautophagy renders the fungus unable to cause rice blast disease, due to impairment of both conidial programmed cell death and appressorium maturation. In contrast, genes necessary only for selective forms of autophagy, such as pexophagy and mitophagy, are dispensable for appressorium-mediated plant infection. This gene is not required for other types of selective autophagy or for nonspecific macroautophagy. However, in contrast to the core autophagy genes such as atg5 and atg7, expression of ulk1 is not essential for induction of macroautophagy in response to nutrient deprivation or for survival of newborn mice. Together, these data suggest that the ATG1 homologue, Ulk1, is a component of the selective autophagy machinery that leads to the elimination of organelles in erythroid cells rather that an essential mechanistic component of autophagy. Growing evidence supports an active role for dysregulated macroautophagy (autophagic stress) in neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration. Alterations in mitochondrial function and dynamics are also strongly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, whereas the core autophagy machinery is evolutionarily conserved and shared among constitutive and induced or selective autophagy, recent studies implicate distinct mechanisms regulating mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in response to general autophagic stimuli. We discovered that activation of the UPR in yeast also induces a new branch of macroautophagy that selectively targets the ER. We term this process ""ER-phagy"", in analogy to pexophagy and mitophagy, the two other known forms of organelle-specific marcoautophagy. ER-phagy involves the generation of autophagosomes that selectively include ER membranes and whose delimiting double membranes also derive, at least in part, from the ER. This suggests that in fungi an organism-specific form of selective autophagy may occur, for which specialized Atg proteins have evolved. ransfer of Y. lipolytica cells from oleate/ethylamine to glucose/ammonium chloride medium leads to selective macroautophagy of peroxisomes. Insulin-dependent signaling regulates azurophil granule-selective macroautophagy in human myeloblastic cells. We show that insulin-dependent signals regulate azurophil granule-selective macroautophagy in human myeloid cells. By contrast, other organelles, including the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus remained intact, indicating that the macroautophagy selectively targeted azurophil granules. Thus, insulin-dependent signals are responsible for the control of azurophil granule-selective macroautophagy via Akt-dependent pathways Eukaryotic cells have the ability to degrade proteins and organelles by selective and nonselective modes of micro- and macroautophagy. For example, pexophagy is a selective process for the regulated degradation of peroxisomes by autophagy. We have characterized biochemically, morphologically, and genetically two distinct pathways for the selective degradation of peroxisomes in Pichia pastoris. These pathways are independently regulated and analogous to microautophagy and macroautophagy that have been defined in mammalian cells. If we are willing to slightly modify our definition of autophagy, with a focus on ""degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal/vacuolar machinery,"" we can include a newly documented process, programmed nuclear destruction (PND). Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that can sequester cytosolic material, including organelles, nonspecifically in a process called nonselective macroautophagy, or target specific protein aggregates designated for destruction in a process called selective autophagy. Selective macroautophagy uses double-membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, to transport cytoplasmic pathogens, organelles and protein complexes to the vacuole for degradation. Autophagy (macroautophagy), a highly conserved eukaryotic mechanism, is a non-selective degradation process, helping to maintain a balance between the synthesis, degradation and subsequent recycling of macromolecules to overcome various stress conditions. Whole organelle turnover is mediated through macroautophagy, a process by which autophagosomes deliver mitochondria to the lysosome for hydrolytic degradation. Macroautophagy is a catabolic process by which the cell degrades cytoplasmic components through the lysosomal machinery. Macroautophagy maintains cellular homeostasis through targeting cytoplasmic contents and organelles into autophagosomes for degradation. Macroautophagy is a catabolic process by which cytosolic components are sequestered by double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and sorted to the lysosomes/vacuoles to be degraded. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a cellular degradation process, which in yeast is induced in response to nutrient deprivation. Macroautophagy was thought to be an unspecific bulk degradation process. Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular degradation process by which cells remove cytosolic long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, and can be monitored by imaging the incorporation of microtubule-associated light chain 3 (LC3) fused to a fluorescent protein (GFP or mCherry) into nascent autophagosomes. Beside macroautophagy, there are several forms of selective autophagy, including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt), pexophagy and mitophagy. Macroautophagy (commonly referred to as autophagy) is the process by which intact organelles and/or large portions of the cytoplasm are engulfed within double-membraned autophagic vacuoles for degradation. This analysis demonstrated that Atg proteins required for non-selective macroautophagy are conserved from yeast to man, stressing the importance of this process in cell survival and viability. Part of the degradation of intracellular proteins occurs in the lysosomes and is mediated by macroautophagy."

Although epilepsy affects most patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), little is known about the natural history of epilepsy in this genetic disease. The tuberous sclerosis gene 2 product tuberin is an important regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multiorgan genetic disease Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant disorder Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance, PEComas are related to the genetic alterations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant genetic disease due to losses of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes which seem to have a role in the regulation of the Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K pathway.

Mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene is responsible for the inherited genetic disease of tuberous sclerosis complex. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a frequent autosomal-dominant condition (affecting 1 in 6000 individuals) caused by various mutations in either the hamartin (TSC1) or the tuberin gene (TSC2). Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disease Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a genetic disease with prominent cutaneous and brain involvement  TSC was recognized to be a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance On average TSC families are very small; in most cases there are fewer than two informative meioses. The size distribution of chromosome 9 linked families was similar to that of non-linked families. The effects of missense changes and small in-frame deletions and insertions on protein function are not easy to predict, and the identification of such variants in individuals at risk of a genetic disease can complicate genetic counselling. One option is to perform functional tests to assess whether the variants affect protein function. We have used this strategy to characterize variants identified in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes in individuals with, or suspected of having, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Tuberous sclerosis is a dominant hereditary disease Many of these advances originated from studies of the genetic disease tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)"
Isn't the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis?,no,"TPN22 is a tyrosine phosphatase and functions as a damper of TCR signals. A C-to-T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 1858 of human PTPN22 cDNA and converting an arginine (R620) to tryptophan (W620) confers the highest risk of rheumatoid arthritis among non-HLA genetic variations that are known to be associated with this disease 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have previously been associated with RA, including PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, CTLA4, PADI4, STAT4, FCRL3, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, KIF5A-PIP4K2C, IL2RB, TNFAIP3, IL10-1082G/A and REL he HLA locus, particularly HLA-DRB1, is its strongest genetic risk determinant across ethnicities. Several other genes, including PTPN22 and PADI4, show modest association with RA.  Several alleles in the epitope-recognition part of the HLA molecule that show the highest association with RA susceptibility, also share a common string of amminoacid residues (the so-called shared-epitope hypothesis). Other variants in potentially pathogenic genes located in non-MHC regions have been implicated by recently performed genome wide analysis studies. These genes include PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, PADI4, STAT4.  n particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided supportive evidence that RA is a disease with a strong genetic background. Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. ssociation of the PTPN22 gene (-1123G > C) polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese patients Eight markers (ie, rs1160542 (AFF3), rs1678542 (KIF5A), rs2476601 (PTPN22), rs3087243 (CTLA4), rs4810485 (CD40), rs5029937 (6q23), rs10760130 (TRAF1/C5) and rs7574865 (STAT4)) were significantly associated with RA by meta-analysis Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on RA identified known and novel susceptibility genes like HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1/C5, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, CD40, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, IL2RB, and KIF5A-PIP4K2C.  This study investigated five confirmed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility genes/loci (HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5) for association with susceptibility and severity in an inception cohort After initial completion of the Human Genome Project on the 16th February 2001, significant progress has been made in identifying other than HLA genome regions linked to the increased RA susceptibility. As an effect several new genes have been recognized as an HLA-independent genetic risk factors of RA. PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA. Recent advances have led to novel identification of genetic polymorphisms that are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA.  In conclusion, we have confirmed that PTPN22 620W allele is associated with Tunisian RA but does not constitute a factor influencing clinical manifestations.  After adjusting for smoking and reproductive factors, PTPN22 was associated with RA risk among Caucasian women in these cohorts We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P=.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples. Although HLA-DRB1 is the main RA gene, it accounts for only part of the familial risk for RA. HLA-DRB1 alleles are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the development of RA in a given individual. Several genome scans conducted in populations from France, Japan, North America and UK have confirmed the role of the HLA region and suggested several other susceptibility loci. Association studies support a role for several genes, including TNFR2, PADI4, SLC22A4, RUNX1, and PTPN22. the level of PTPN22.6 in peripheral blood correlates with disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis PTPN22, PADI-4, and CTLA-4 have been associated with risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) progression from undifferentiated arthritis to rheumatoid arthritis: the effect of the PTPN22 1858T-allele In this Dutch cohort of UA-patients, the PTPN22 1858T allele does not markedly improve individual decision-making to predict RA-development challenges in identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis are the same as those faced in most complex diseases Recently a number of convincing candidate genes have begun to emerge and an update has been provided for three of these: PTPN22"
Is Calcium homeostasis important in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology?,yes,"Maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis is critical to regulating mitochondrial ATP production and cardiac contraction.  the Ca(2+) signal regulates the most important activities of the cell, from the expression of genes, to heart and muscle contraction and other motility processes, to diverse metabolic pathways involved in the generation of cell fuels Pharmacologic modification of cellular calcium handling recently moved into focus as an alternative for prevention and treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias diabetic rats displayed abnormal cardiac structure and systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and spermine (CaSR agonist) could prevent or slow its progression. These results indicate that the CaSR expression of myocardium is reduced in the progress of DCM, and its potential mechanism is related to the impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis. calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays important roles in cardiac electrical activity and calcium homeostasis. NCX current (I(NCX)) shows transmural gradient across left ventricle in many species. Previous studies demonstrated that NCX expression was increased and transmural gradient of I(NCX) was disrupted in failing heart calcium homeostasis, the key process underlying excitation-contraction coupling The results indicate the calcium handling properties of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are relatively immature to hESC counterparts Our understanding of the molecular processes which regulate cardiac function has grown immeasurably in recent years. Even with the advent of β-blockers, angiotensin inhibitors and calcium modulating agents, heart failure (HF) still remains a seriously debilitating and life-threatening condition. Here, we review the molecular changes which occur in the heart in response to increased load and the pathways which control cardiac hypertrophy, calcium homeostasis, and immune activation during HF. Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are G-protein coupled receptors which maintain systemic calcium homeostasis and participate in hormone secretion, activation of ion channels, cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. CaSRs are associated with I/R injury and apoptosis in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes via suppressing Bcl-2 and promoting caspase-3 expression. Important insights into the molecular basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and related diseases have been gained by studying families with inherited cardiac hypertrophy. Integrated clinical and genetic investigations have demonstrated that different genetic defects can give rise to the common phenotype of cardiac hypertrophy. Diverse pathways have been identified, implicating perturbations in force generation, force transmission, intracellular calcium homeostasis, myocardial energetics, and cardiac metabolism in causing disease HAX-1 as a regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. Thus, HAX-1 represents a regulatory mechanism in cardiac calcium cycling and its responses to sympathetic stimulation, implicating its importance in calcium homeostasis and cell survival. Calcium ions are the most ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Calcium homeostasis and signaling systems are crucial for both the normal growth of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the intricate working of the mammalian heart. this knowledge can be used to help treat relevant human diseases such as pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure With aging, the heart develops myocyte hypertrophy associated with impaired relaxation indices. To define the cellular basis of this adaptation, we examined the physiological changes that arise in calcium handling in the aging heart and contrasted the adaptations that occur following the imposition of a stimulus that alters calcium homeostasis in a young and an old heart alterations in the calcium-handling machinery of the cardiocyte differ in the context of age and as such may predispose the older heart to the development of a hypertrophic phenotype. The cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX1) is a key sarcolemmal protein for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the heart.  Thus exchanger overexpression in mice leads to abnormal calcium handling and a decompensatory transition to heart failure with stress Central to controlling intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) are a number of Ca(2+) transporters and channels with the L-type Ca(2+) channel, Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) being of particular note in the heart. This review concentrates on the regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) in cardiac muscle and the homeostatic mechanisms employed to ensure that the heart can operate under steady-state conditions on a beat by beat basis. the tight regulation of SR Ca(2+) content is also required to prevent the abnormal, spontaneous or diastolic release of Ca(2+) from the SR. Such diastolic events are a major factor contributing to the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias in disease situations and in recently identified familial mutations in the SR Ca(2+) release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR). Calcium channels have a unique functional role, because not only do they participate in this activity, they form the means by which electrical signals are converted to responses within the cell. Calcium channels play an integral role in excitation in the heart and shaping the cardiac action potential. In addition, calcium influx through calcium channels is responsible for initiating contraction. Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis underlie cardiac arrhythmia, contractile dysfunction and cardiac remodelling.  Cardiac calcium (Ca(2+)) handling subsumes the mechanisms maintaining the myocardial Ca(2+) homeostasis that contribute essentially to cardiac performance. Calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation and disorders in cardiac Ca(2+) homeostasis have great influence on the cardiac action potential. We review the physiology of the cardiac calcium homeostasis, including the cardiac excitation contraction coupling and myocyte calcium cycling.

Is there any link between ERCC1-XPF and cohesin?,yes,"ERCC1-XPF cooperates with CTCF and cohesin to facilitate the developmental silencing of imprinted genes. Using an in vivo biotinylation tagging approach in mice, we show that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) structure-specific endonuclease ERCC1-XPF complex interacts with the insulator binding protein CTCF, the cohesin subunits SMC1A and SMC3 and with MBD2; the factors co-localize with ATRX at the promoters and control regions (ICRs) of imprinted genes during postnatal hepatic development. Loss of Ercc1 or exposure to MMC triggers the localization of CTCF to heterochromatin, the dissociation of the CTCF-cohesin complex and ATRX from promoters and ICRs, altered histone marks and the aberrant developmental expression of imprinted genes without altering DNA methylation. We propose that ERCC1-XPF cooperates with CTCF and cohesin to facilitate the developmental silencing of imprinted genes and that persistent DNA damage triggers chromatin changes that affect gene expression programs associated with NER disorders.

Are Notch mutations related to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL)?,yes,"Notch receptors participate in a highly conserved signalling pathway that regulates normal development and tissue homeostasis in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Deregulated Notch signalling has been implicated in many diseases, but the clearest example of a pathogenic role is found in T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-LL), in which the majority of human and murine tumours have acquired mutations that lead to aberrant increases in Notch1 signalling. NOTCH proteins (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4) play crucial roles in embryonic development. Also, mounting evidence indicates that NOTCH contributes to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic and solid malignancies. Recent studies reported a high incidence of gain-of-function mutations of the NOTCH1 gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL).  Our data indicate that NOTCH1 is mutated in T-ALL, but not in other common human cancers, and that NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTH4 genes are rarely mutated in common human cancers.  The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies. Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is characterized as a high-risk stratified disease associated with frequent relapse, chemotherapy resistance, and a poorer prognostic outlook than B-precursor ALL. Many of the challenges in treating T-ALL reflect the lack of prognostic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities on which to base therapy, including targeted therapy. Notch1 activating mutations were identified in more than 50% of T-ALL cases and can be therapeutically targeted with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs).  Notch1 is a transmembrane receptor that is frequently mutated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) is characterized by aberrant activation of NOTCH1 in over 60% of T-ALL cases. The high prevalence of activating NOTCH1 mutations highlights the critical role of NOTCH signaling in the pathogenesis of this disease and has prompted the development of therapeutic approaches targeting the NOTCH signaling pathway.  Activating mutations in NOTCH1, an essential regulator of T cell development, are frequently found in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients. Mutations in NOTCH1/FBXW7 activate NOTCH signaling and are of prognostic significance in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling. Activation of the Notch pathway occurs commonly in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) because of mutations in Notch1 or Fbw7 and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients frequently display NOTCH1 activating mutations and Notch can transcriptionally down-regulate the tumor suppressor PTEN. The identification of activating mutations in NOTCH1 in over 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) has generated major interest in the elucidation of the mechanisms of transformation downstream of oncogenic NOTCH and in the targeting of the NOTCH signaling pathway in this disease. BACKGROUND: In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), activating mutations of NOTCH1 are observed in more than 50% of cases, whereas the t(7;9)(q34;q34) involving NOTCH1 at 9q34 and TRB@ at 7q34 is an extremely rare but recurrent translocation. Activating mutations in NOTCH1 consitute the most prominent genetic abnormality in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1 and dysregulation of MYC The Notch signaling pathway has been recognized as a key factor for the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), because of the high incidence of activating mutations of Notch1 Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)"
Are BRAF mutations common in melanoma?,yes,"patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. BRAF-mutated melanoma  The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has been reported to be activated in over 80% of all cutaneous melanomas, making it the focus of many scientific studies in the melanoma field. Discoveries of mutations and aberrant expression of components in this cascade, in particular, BRAF and NRAS render a deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for oncogenesis and provide new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease.   BRAF-targeted therapies (e.g., vemurafenib, dabrafenib) have showed impressive results in systemic therapy for melanoma harboring activating BRAF V600E mutations.   An independent cohort of 91 archival MUPs was also screened for 46 hot spot mutations highly prevalent in melanoma including BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11.  a high rate of BRAF (45 of 101, 45%) and NRAS (32 of 101, 32%) mutations, collectively indicating a mutation profile consistent with cutaneous sun-exposed melanomas. Treatment of advanced melanoma has been improved with the advent of the BRAF inhibitors. BRAF is the most prevalent oncogene and an important therapeutic target in melanoma. Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  BRAF mutations have emerged as an important predictive biomarker for metastasized melanoma.  BRAF V600 selective inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of V600 mutation positive metastatic melanoma,  BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma  Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. The treatment of patients with advanced melanoma is rapidly evolving due to an improved understanding of molecular drivers of this disease. Somatic mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alteration found in these tumors.  genetically activated BRAF, is now commonly prescribed for metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF mutation. BRAF inhibitors improve melanoma patient survival, but resistance invariably develops.  BRAF inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal.  Most patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors.  BRAF(V600E) mutation confers constitutive BRAK kinase activation in melanoma cells, promoting tumor growth. This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.  (V600)BRAF mutation was identified as an ideal target for clinical therapy due to its indispensable roles in supporting melanoma initiation and progression. The Braf(V600E) mutation has been detected in patients with metastatic melanoma, colon, thyroid, and other cancers. Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patient BRAF mutations occur in approximately 8% of all human cancers and approach 50% in melanoma and papillary carcinoma of thyroid. Vemurafenib is a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the V600 mutant form of the BRAF protein used in the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer. Molecular studies demonstrated that the melanoma was positive for the 1799T>A (V600E) mutation in the BRAF gene. RAF kinase inhibitors have substantial therapeutic effects in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. An activating BRAF (V600E) kinase mutation occurs in approximately half of melanomas.  Activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in approximately 50% of melanomas. More than 70% of BRAF mutations are V600E and 10-30% are V600K. Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  Personalized melanoma medicine has progressed from histopathologic features to serum markers to molecular profiles. Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patients. The clinical activity of BRAF inhibitor (BRAF-I) therapy is a major breakthrough in the treatment of metastatic melanoma carrying BRAF mutations.  The discovery of BRAF mutations in melanoma led to the development of BRAF inhibitors for the treatment of advanced melanoma.  BRAF represents one of the most frequently mutated protein kinase genes in human tumours. The mutation is commonly tested in pathology practice. BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients.  A majority of cutaneous melanomas show activating mutations in the NRAS or BRAF proto-oncogenes, components of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in ∼50% of all melanomas has proved to be a turning point in the therapeutic management of the disseminated disease. This review summarizes the critical role of BRAF in melanoma pathophysiology, the clinical and pathological determinants of BRAF mutation status and finally addresses the current state of the art of BRAF inhibitors. To better understand the BRAF mutation profile in melanomas, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1112 primary and metastatic melanomas at our institution. The cohort included nonacral cutaneous (n = 774), acral (n = 111), mucosal (n = 26), uveal (n = 23), leptomeningeal (n = 1), and metastatic melanomas of unknown primary site (n = 177). BRAF mutation hotspot regions in exons 11 and 15 were analyzed by pyrosequencing or with the primer extension MassARRAY system. A total of 499 (44.9%) specimens exhibited BRAF mutations, involving exon 15 [497 (99.6%)] or exon 11 [2 (0.4%)]. p.V600E was detected in 376 (75.4%) cases; the remaining 123 (24.6%) cases exhibited non-p.V600E mutations, of which p.V600K was most frequent [86 (17.2%)]. BRAF mutations were more frequent in nonacral cutaneous (51.4%) than acral melanomas [18 (16.2%)] (P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference among cutaneous histological subtypes. All mucosal, uveal, and leptomeningeal melanomas were BRAF wild type (WT). Recently, it was reported that BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma. Activating mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alterations in melanoma. Oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequent in malignant melanoma. Mutation of BRAF is now known to be common in cutaneous melanomas, and raises possible new therapeutic options of anti-RAF treatment for these patients BRAF mutations are common events in a variety of melanocytic nevi and primary cutaneous melanomas Approximately 40-60% of melanomas from Caucasian populations carry activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene, with the most common being the p.Val600Glu (V600E) hotspot mutation in exon 15 Using a cohort of 115 patients with primary invasive melanomas, we show that BRAF mutations are statistically significantly more common in melanomas occurring on skin subject to intermittent sun exposure than elsewhere (23 of 43 patients; P<.001, two-sided Fisher's exact test) BRAF mutations have been identified as the most common oncogene mutation in melanomas, especially important in those originating on nonchronically sun-damaged skin."
Is armodafinil used for treatment of insomnia?,no,"Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness. Other treatment options may include pharmacologic interventions such as modafinil and armodafinil, which have shown efficacy in this population. BACKGROUND: Armodafinil (Nuvigil(®), Cephalon, Inc., Frazer, PA, USA), the longer-lasting isomer of racemic modafinil, is a nonamphetamine, wakefulness-promoting medication. In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder, treated obstructive sleep apnoea, or narcolepsy, armodafinil has been found to improve wakefulness throughout the shift or day. In addition, while not approved for this indication, armodafinil has been found to improve excessive sleepiness associated with jet-lag disorder. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting medication. Its efficacy and tolerability have been established in 12-week studies of patients with excessive sleepiness (ES) associated with treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), shift work disorder (SWD), or narcolepsy.  Armodafinil represents an option for long-term treatment of patients with ES associated with treated OSA, SWD, or narcolepsy. The wakefulness-promoting agents armodafinil and modafinil are FDA approved for the treatment of ES in patients with SWD. CONCLUSIONS: Armodafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition related to excessive sleepiness as rated by the CGI-C and was well tolerated in patients with treated OSA and comorbid depression. CONCLUSION: In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with chronic SWD of moderate or greater severity, armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness during scheduled night work, raising mean nighttime sleep latency above the level considered to indicate severe sleepiness during the daytime. Armodafinil also significantly improved measures of overall clinical condition, long-term memory, and attention.  Adjunct treatment with armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness, long-term memory, and patients' ability to engage in activities of daily living in nCPAP-adherent individuals with ES associated with OSA.  A number of studies have evaluated countermeasures or interventions in shift workers; proposed treatments include chronobiotic interventions, such as light exposure, melatonin, hypnotic agents, caffeine and CNS stimulants (amphetamine), and the wake-promoting agents modafinil and armodafinil.  These studies showed that modafinil and armodafinil significantly improve the ability to sustain wakefulness during waking activities (e.g. working, driving), overall clinical condition, and sustained attention or memory in patients with SWSD.  CONCLUSIONS: In this selected population of patients with OSA/HS and residual ES despite effective treatment with nCPAP, armodafinil QD used as an adjunct to nCPAP treatment was associated with improved wakefulness and overall clinical condition.   Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness.

Is there a role for transcription factories in genome organization?,yes,"The mammalian nucleus is a highly complex structure that carries out a diverse range of functions such as DNA replication, cell division, RNA processing, and nuclear export/import. Many of these activities occur at discrete subcompartments that intersect with specific regions of the genome. Over the past few decades, evidence has accumulated to suggest that RNA transcription also occurs in specialized sites, called transcription factories, that may influence how the genome is organized. There may be certain efficiency benefits to cluster transcriptional activity in this way. However, the clustering of genes at transcription factories may have consequences for genome stability, and increase the susceptibility to recurrent chromosomal translocations that lead to cancer In the eukaryotic nucleus, genes are transcribed in transcription factories Based on this analysis, we propose that transcription factories result from the aggregation of RNA polymerase II-containing pre-initiation complexes assembled next to each other in the nuclear space. Such an aggregation can be triggered by the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II molecules and their interaction with various transcription factors. Individual transcription factories would thus incorporate tissue-specific, co-regulated as well as housekeeping genes based only on their initial proximity to each other in the nuclear space active polymerases cluster into replication and transcription ""factories"" in both pro- and eukaryotes. We conclude that the second law of thermodynamics acts through nonspecific entropic forces between engaged polymerases to drive the self-organization of genomes into loops containing several thousands (and sometimes millions) of basepairs Since the advent of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), there have been major advances in our understanding of how the genome is organized in interphase nuclei. Indeed, this organization is found to be non-random and individual chromosomes occupy discrete regions known as territories  in proliferating cells, there is evidently a correlation between radial positioning and gene density. Indeed, gene-poor chromosomes tend to be located towards the nuclear edge, while those that are more gene-rich are positioned more internally Recently described active chromatin hubs and transcription factories also involve long-range interactions The transcription factory model has implications for the regulation of transcription initiation and elongation, for the organization of genes in the genome, for the co-regulation of genes and for genome instability."
Could hypophosphatemic rickets cause craniosynostosis?,yes,"This study examines a series of patients with hypophosphatemic rickets and craniosynostosis to characterize the clinical course and associated craniofacial anomalies.  Hypophosphatemic rickets and craniosynostosis: a multicenter case series. A 20-year retrospective review identified patients with hypophosphatemic rickets and secondary craniosynostosis at 3 major craniofacial centers.  Secondary craniosynostosis develops postnatally due to metabolic or mechanical factors. The most common metabolic cause is hypophosphatemic rickets, which has a variety of etiologies. Head shape changes occur later and with a more heterogeneous presentation compared with that of primary craniosynostosis. Patients with multisutural involvement or X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets had a significant delay in presentation for craniosynostosis.  Craniosynostosis can be gene-linked, or caused by metabolic diseases, such as rickets, which results from a deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus or calcium leading to hypomineralization of the bone. X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (XLHR) is the most prevalent genetic type of hypophosphatemic rickets and is caused by germ line mutations in the PHEX-gene. In XLHR, only few case reports of craniosynostosis were described. Papilledema in the setting of x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets with craniosynostosis. Case report of a 3-year-old female presenting with papilledema resulting from craniosynostosis secondary to XLH. X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets and craniosynostosis. X-linked hypophosphatemic (XLH) rickets is the most common form of metabolic rickets, and there have been reports linking XLH rickets to craniosynostosis. A clinical report of a patient with XLH rickets and craniosynostosis is presented with a review of literature.  This may be the reason for the common association of craniosynostosis and XLH rickets.  Craniosynostosis and associated craniofacial deformities, such as frontal bossing, often occur as symptoms of vitamin D-resistant rickets in children. Similar skull deformities develop in mice with X-linked dominant hypophosphatemia, the most common form of vitamin D-resistant rickets.  The x-linked hypophosphatemic mouse is an animal model that can be used to study the role of vitamin D-resistant rickets in the development of craniosynostosis, to relate craniosynostosis to the development of associated skull deformities, and to test new treatment procedures. Craniosynostosis secondary to rickets is rarely reported, but since neither rickets nor craniosynostosis is a reportable disease, the exact incidence of both diseases is unknown. X-linked hypophosphatemic (XLH) rickets is the most common form of metabolic rickets, and there have been reports linking XLH rickets to craniosynostosis.

Doesn't do a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,yes,"An East African population that gave rise to non-Africans underwent a selective sweep affecting the subcentromeric region where MTMR8 is located. This and similar sweeps in four other regions of the X chromosome, documented in the literature, effectively reduced genetic diversity of non-African chromosomes a selective sweep that has removed genetic variation from much of the drive X chromosome. evidence of reduced diversity and an excess of fixed replacement sites, consistent with a species-wide selective sweep. recent independent selective sweeps in AGO2 have reduced genetic variation episodes of natural selection (likely a selective sweep) predating the coalescent of human lineages, within the last 25 million years, account for the observed reduced diversity reduced variation or deviations from neutrality that might indicate a recent selective sweep Consider a genetic locus carrying a strongly beneficial allele which has recently fixed in a large population. As strongly beneficial alleles fix quickly, sequence diversity at partially linked neutral loci is reduced. This phenomenon is known as a selective sweep. a local selective sweep or demographic process that reduced variability reduced variation (a selective sweep) the mtDNA diversity, but not the nuclear DNA diversity, has been reduced relative to the neutral expectation of molecular evolution, suggesting the action of a selective sweep Furthermore, the amount of genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations. Our observation of reduction in variation at both intragenic and flanking loci of mutant pfcrt gene confirmed the selective sweep model of natural selection in chloroquine resistant P. A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection. In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at OsAMT1;1 in rice was caused by a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice. A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection"
Is vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,yes,"Vortioxetine is the most recently approved medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).  [Vortioxetine: a new antidepressant to treat depressive episodes]. Vortioxetine is a new antidepressant, which mechanism of action is multimodal, targeting the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT3, 5-HT7 receptors and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT).  In short-term studies (8 weeks), vortioxetine is more efficacious than placebo in decreasing depressive symptoms as measured by the MADRS total score, response rate (vortioxetine: 53.2% vs placebo: 35.2%) and remission rate (vortioxetine: 29.2% vs placebo: 19.3%). In a long-term study (52 weeks), vortioxetine is also superior to placebo in preventing relapses and recurrences. Moreover, in second line treatment, after failure of a first line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), vortioxetine is superior to agomelatine in improving depressive symptoms and achieving response and remission.  Against this background, we feature the novel antidepressants vortioxetine, vilazodone and milnacipran/levomilnacipran with regard to their serotonin receptor targets such as the 5-HT1A, 5-HT3 and 5-HT7 which may account for their specific effects on certain symptoms of depression (e.g. cognition and anxiety) as well as a characteristic side-effect profile. CONCLUSION: Vortioxetine dominated venlafaxine XR in South Korea and is a relevant treatment option for MDD patients initiating or switching therapy. Vortioxetine: a New Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. INTRODUCTION: Vortioxetine is a structurally novel medication that has recently been approved for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). EXPERT OPINION: Results of placebo-controlled trials suggest efficacy and an overall safety profile comparable to existing first-line antidepressants.  The authors suggest that vortioxetine is currently a good second-line antidepressant option and shows promise, pending additional long-term data, to become a first-line antidepressant option. Clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than was placebo, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.118 (95% CIs, -0.203 to -0.033, P = 0.007).

Vortioxetine (Lu-AA-21004; 1-[2-(2,4-dimethylphenylsulfanyl)phenyl]piperazine hydrobromide) is a novel orally active molecule that is being investigated by Lundbeck and Takeda for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorders. Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a multi-modal antidepressant in clinical development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). A randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine 2.5 and 10 mg in acute treatment of adults with generalized anxiety disorder. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. Secondary endpoints included response and remission rates, anxiety symptoms(Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), Clinical Global Impression, overall functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale), health-related quality of life(EuroQol 5 Dimensions), productivity (work limitation questionnaire) and family functioning (Depression and Family Functioning Scale).RESULTS: Primary endpoint noninferiority was established and vortioxetine (n = 252) was superior to agomelatine (n = 241) by 2.2 MADRS points (p<0.01). Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is an antidepressant with a mechanism of action thought to be related to a combination of 2 pharmacologic actions: direct modulation of several receptors and inhibition of the serotonin transporter.To evaluate the efficacy of vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg once daily in outpatients with major depressive disorder.This 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted from July 2010 to January 2012 among adults with a primary diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder (DSM-IV-TR).Eligible subjects were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms: vortioxetine 10 mg, vortioxetine 20 mg, or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a new antidepressant that combines a number of neurotransmitter reuptake and receptor effects that have been thought to predict efficacy as a treatment for depressive and anxiety disorders.This review summarizes the pharmacology and neurobiology of vortioxetine In the study of elderly patients, vortioxetine 5 mg (n = 136) improved 12-item Health Status Questionnaire scores significantly more than placebo (n = 148) for the domains of health perception (10.4, P &lt; 0.0001, SES of 0.54), mental health (7.9, P &lt; 0.001, SES of 0.44), and energy (6.4, P &lt; 0.05, SES of 0.28) (FAS, mixed model for repeated measures).Vortioxetine yielded significant, meaningful HRQoL improvements in 6 MDD studies of 6 to 8 weeks duration. All references included were published between 1999 and 2014.All studies that included humans and were published in English, with data describing vortioxetine for the treatment of MDD, were reviewed.Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal antidepressant agent, which inhibits the 5-HT transporter protein, acts as a 5-HT3 antagonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day Vortioxetine is an antidepressant with multimodal activity which has shown efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in six of ten short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (completed end 2012).We performed meta-regression analyses to indirectly compare vortioxetine to seven marketed antidepressants with different mechanisms of action Data were available from 51 human trials involving vortioxetine, and included a total of 7,666 healthy volunteers and patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder who were exposed to at least 1 dose of vortioxetine for a total of 2,743 patient-years.Vortioxetine was effective in treating MDD in the United States at a dose of 20 mg/d Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.Subjects (n = 457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10 mg once daily There was a significant difference for nausea between the two groups (OR=3.01, 95 % CI=2.22-4.09, Z=7.08, P=0.00001), but no significant differences were observed for the other four adverse effects.CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of major depressive disorder, our results show that a dose of 5 mg/day vortioxetine was more effective, but more easily induced nausea, compared to placebo. The efficacy and safety of 5 mg/d Vortioxetine compared to placebo for major depressive disorder: A meta-analysis. Vortioxetine: a meta-analysis of 12 short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Vortioxetine in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind controlled trials. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day.  Clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was significantly higher in the duloxetine group than in the vortioxetine group.Duloxetine was more effective but less well-tolerated than vortioxetine in MDD. There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates between vortioxetine and comparators owing to inefficacy (OR 0.983, 95% CI 0.585 to 1.650), whereas discontinuation owing to AEs was significantly less common in the vortioxetine than in the comparator group (OR 0.728, 95% CI 0.554 to 0.957).Studies examining the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD are limited.Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a l We performed a meta-analysis to increase the statistical power of these studies and enhance our current understanding of the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD.We performed an extensive search of databases and the clinical trial registry. BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.METHODS: Subjects (n = 457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10 mg once daily. Vortioxetine significantly improved objective and subjective measures of cognitive function in adults with recurrent MDD and these effects were largely independent of its effect on improving depressive symptoms. Furthermore, a statistically significant number of patients with MDD who were on vortioxetine have achieved a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in depression symptoms from baseline. BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal compound that has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a limited number of heterogeneous RCTs.. Vortioxetine is an effective agent for the treatment of MDD, but it does not have any clear advantages over other available treatment options.. Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than placebo for acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Duloxetine was more effective but less well-tolerated than vortioxetine in MDD."
Are there methods for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries?,yes,"A method for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries. The barcoding of next generation sequencing libraries has become an essential part of the experimental design. Barcoding not only allows the sequencing of more than one sample per lane, but also reduces technical bias. However, current barcoding strategies impose significant limitations and/or technical barriers in their implementation for ChIP-sequencing.FINDINGS: Converting Y-shaped sequencing adapters to double stranded DNA prior to agarose gel size selection reduces adapter dimer contamination and quantitating the number of cycles required for amplification of the library with qPCR prior to library amplification eliminates library over-amplification.CONCLUSIONS: We describe an efficient and cost effective method for making barcoded ChIP-seq libraries for sequencing on the Illumina platform.

Aren't long non coding RNAs as conserved in sequence as protein coding genes?,yes,"Most lncRNAs are under lower sequence constraints than protein-coding genes and lack conserved secondary structures, making it hard to predict them computationally. hey are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. bout one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage."
Doesn't smoking increase risk for glioblastoma?,yes,"Glioma risk has consistently been inversely associated with allergy history but not with smoking history despite putative biologic plausibility. No relation was observed between glioma risk and smoking (odds ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 1.10; P = 0.37), and there were no interactions for glioma risk of smoking history with any of the risk alleles.  Non-smokers with G/A and A/A genotype showed increased glioma risk compared with G/G genotype (adjusted OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.29-2.30, p = 0.0002 and adjusted OR = 1.81, 95%CI: 1.10-2.99, p = 0.020, respectively). This association was not found in ever- or current-smokers.  There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use.  RESULTS: We found no associations between the GSTM3, GSTP1, NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, or GSTT1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk with the possible exception of a weak association between the G-C (Val-Ala) GSTP1 105/114 haplotype and glioma [odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.54, 0.99], nor was there an interaction between the effects of the GSTM3 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and cigarette smoking. We did not find any evidence for an association with life-style characteristics such as cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, use of drugs of any kind, or dietary intake of cured or smoked meat or fish. No relation was observed between glioma risk and smoking (odds ratio = 0 Glioma risk has consistently been inversely associated with allergy history but not with smoking history despite putative biologic plausibility Compared with nonsmokers, duration of cigarette smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day and pack-years of smoking were associated with increased glioma risk, although the increases in risk were relatively modest Among ever smokers, women who reported having quit smoking had a 51% increase in risk of glioma compared with never smokers (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.97-2.34), while current smokers did not appear to have an increase in risk"

Is imatinib an antidepressant drug?,no,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. Surgery remains the elective treatment. We retrospectively compared two group of patients, who underwent surgery for GIST before and after Imatinib advent in order to analyze the recurrence and survival rate. Adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for 3 years duration is a standard treatment in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs R1 surgery (versus R0) alone is not an indication for adjuvant imatinib in low-risk GIST. Treatment is not recommended in an imatinib-insensitive D842V-mutated GIST Prognostic factors such as tumor size, mitotic rate and presence of metastases may provide an indication for adjuvant imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment. Here we present a young patient with a large GIST with high-risk features who is in complete remission after surgical excision and adjuvant IM treatment. This patient is the only colon-located CD117-positive case where IM was administered. Imatinib mesylate is the sole BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as first-line treatment of accelerated-phase (AP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). imatinib mesylate could be a therapeutic target of strategies against osteosarcoma tumors. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is well-established as a potentially curative treatment for patients who have chronic myeloid leukemia. The success of imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as initial therapy has changed the treatment paradigm for this disease. Imatinib plus hydroxyurea is well tolerated among patients with meningioma but has modest anti-tumor activity for this indication. Ki67 correlated with time to recurrence (p=0.022). Ki67 >11% was taken as the indication to start imatinib chemotherapy (sensitivity 61.5%, specificity 92.0%, p=0.022). Significant pharmacokinetic interactions have already been shown between St. John's Wort (SJW) and the anticancer drugs imatinib and irinotecan. for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. Imatinib mesylate, an orally administered kinase inhibitor that targets the Kit (CD117) protein, currently has 10 approved indications including treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The drugs were assessed according to clinical evidence on efficacy and safety, based on Micromedex categorization, on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Indications present in the legal documentation were compared to the indications approved by regulatory agencies. RESULTS: Bevacizumab, capecitabine, cetuximab, erlotinib, rituximab, imatinib, and temozolomide Bcr-Abl, an oncogene responsible for CML Bcr-Abl-expressing cells showed resistance to death activated by spindle defects, reversed by imatinib. Imatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is first-line treatment in patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST. Surgical indication for metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) treated with imatinib is not yet established. Surgery of residual disease upon best clinical response seems associated with survival benefit compared with historical controls in similar patient collectives treated with imatinib alone. To explore the effect of preoperative imatinib mesylate (IM) in patients with unresectable or locally advanced primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) The patient had been diagnosed 14 months earlier and had been submitted to surgery, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemotherapy. On clinical suspicion of recurrence 5 months later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion at the site of preceded surgery, which was treated by imatinib mesylate Radical surgery remains the most effective method of GIST treatment. In inoperable/metastatic lesion the treatment of choice is tyrosinase kinase inhibitor--imatinib. Imatinib mesylate (STI571), a specific Bcr-Abl inhibitor, has shown a potent antileukemic activity in clinical studies of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Imatinib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit, was used as an adjuvant chemotherapy in two patients who underwent curative surgery for recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for 3 years duration is a standard treatment in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs."
Is gastro esophageal reflux related to burning mouth syndrome?,no,"Our results suggest that there is no causal connection between LPR episodes and the occurrence of intraoral burning sensations in the examined patients. As reported below, although this symptom may well be diagnostically misleading, careful diagnosis based on clinical signs may distinguish patients with BMS from those with reflux disease, and successful management of burning mouth is often enables."

A graphics processing unit was used to greatly reduce the training time of our models with millions of parameters. We show that the deep architecture surpasses the performance of the previous Bayesian method for predicting AS patterns. With the proper optimization procedure and selection of hyperparameters, we demonstrate that deep architectures can be beneficial, even with a moderately sparse dataset.

Doesn't HuR protein regulate the splicing process?,no,"HuR and TIA1/TIAL1 are involved in regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA Here we describe experiments showing that HuR and TIA1/TIAL1, two kinds of RNA-binding proteins, were involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA under normal and stress circumstances HuR increased SIRT1-∆Exon8 by promoting SIRT1 exon 8 exclusion, whereas TIA1/TIAL1 inhibition of the exon 8 exclusion led to a decrease in SIRT1-∆Exon8 mRNA levels.  HuR regulates alternative splicing of the TRA2β gene in human colon cancer cells under oxidative stress Hu antigen R (HuR) regulates stress responses through stabilizing and/or facilitating the translation of target mRNAs We show here that the RBP embryonic lethal abnormal vision like 1 (ELAVL1, also know as HuR) regulates the alternative splicing of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E nuclear import factor 1 (Eif4enif1), which encodes an eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E transporter (4E-T) protein and suppresses the expression of capped mRNAs Further, endothelial-specific Elavl1 knockout mice exhibited reduced revascularization after hind limb ischemia and tumor angiogenesis in oncogene-induced mammary cancer, resulting in attenuated blood flow and tumor growth, respectively.  Changes in cellular mRNA stability, splicing, and polyadenylation through HuR protein sequestration by a cytoplasmic RNA virus Furthermore, significant changes can be observed in nuclear alternative polyadenylation and splicing events on cellular pre-mRNAs as a result of sequestration of HuR protein by the 3' UTR of transcripts of this cytoplasmic RNA virus. Here we demonstrate that expression of 2A(pro) induces a selective nucleo-cytoplasm translocation of several important RNA binding proteins and splicing factors. Subcellular fractionation studies, together with immunofluorescence microscopy revealed an asymmetric distribution of HuR and TIA1/TIAR in 2A(pro) expressing cells, which modulates splicing of the human Fas exon 6 knockdown of HuR or overexpression of TIA1/TIAR, leads to Fas exon 6 inclusion in 2A(pro)-expressing cells The differential expression levels of T-cell intracellular antigens (TIA) and Hu antigen R (HuR) are concomitant with a splicing switch in apoptosis receptor Fas in HCT-116 cells overexpression and knockdown of HuR led to Fas exon 6 skipping and inclusion, respectively. These results suggest that the TIA and HuR cellular ratio influences cell-type specific Fas exon 6 splicing pattern. Hu antigen R (HuR) functions as an alternative pre-mRNA splicing regulator of Fas apoptosis-promoting receptor on exon definition antiapoptotic regulator Hu antigen R (HuR, ELAVL1), a member of the embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila-like (ELAVL) family, promotes Fas exon 6 skipping by binding to an exonic splicing silencer ELAV/Hu proteins bind to AU-rich elements (ARE) in mRNAs and regulate their stability from splicing to translation, and the ubiquitous HuR protein has been implicated in cancerous cell growth. The HuR protein regulates the expression of thousands of cellular transcripts by modulating mRNA splicing, trafficking, translation, and stability. Hu antigen R (HuR) functions as an alternative pre-mRNA splicing regulator of Fas apoptosis-promoting receptor on exon definition. I report that antiapoptotic regulator Hu antigen R (HuR, ELAVL1), a member of the embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila-like (ELAVL) family, promotes Fas exon 6 skipping by binding to an exonic splicing silencer.  Changes in cellular mRNA stability, splicing, and polyadenylation through HuR protein sequestration by a cytoplasmic RNA virus. Further, the silencing capacity of HuR as splicing regulator resides in the RRM1 and hinge-RRM3 domains.  HuR and TIA1/TIAL1 are involved in regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA. HuR regulates alternative splicing of the TRA2β gene in human colon cancer cells under oxidative stress. The HuR protein regulates the expression of thousands of cellular transcripts by modulating mRNA splicing, trafficking, translation, and stability.  Further, the silencing capacity of HuR as splicing regulator resides in the RRM1 and hinge-RRM3 domains. Taken together, these results support a functional link between HuR as repressor of alternative Fas splicing and the molecular mechanisms modulating programmed cell death. We are interested in interactions involving hnRNP proteins participating in several steps of mRNA processing (mainly pre-mRNA splicing) and HuR with an established role in stability/translation of associated mRNAs. hnRNP and HuR proteins have a major nucleoplasmic localization and ability to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. We report here on interactions between hnRNP and HuR proteins that were identified in the context of isolated hnRNP and mRNP complexes.  Despite the fact that HuR sites are observed in intronic regions, our data do not support a role for HuR in regulating splicing."
Is there a role of regorafenib for sarcoma treatment?,yes,"Regorafenib has been approved for third-line therapy. Study protocol of REGOSARC trial: activity and safety of regorafenib in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II trial. DISCUSSION: The design of this trial allows an assessment of regorafenib activity over placebo in four sarcoma strata and might provide evidence for launching a phase III trial. This case provides rationale for adding a Ewing sarcoma arm to SARC024, a phase II study of regorafenib, another multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, in patients with liposarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing and Ewing-like sarcomas (NCT02048371). Thus, the Phase III studies with pazopanib, regorafenib, muramyl tripeptide (MTP) and ridaforolimus are extensively discussed as well as the biological rationale for the use of these compounds. Currently, regorafenib is examined in several clinical trials (mostly phase II) in different tumor entities, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Analysis of primary human sarcoma samples revealed direct cytotoxicity following exposure to sorafenib and regorafenib with a corresponding increase in ALDHbright cells (P<0.05). Parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were performed as appropriate.RESULTS: After functionally validating the CSC phenotype of ALDHbright sarcoma cells, we observed that sorafenib and regorafenib were cytotoxic to sarcoma cell lines (P<0.05), with a corresponding 1.4 - 2.8 fold increase in ALDHbright cells from baseline (P<0.05). We evaluated survival and CSC phenotype in mice harboring sarcoma metastases after TKI therapy. We exposed dissociated primary sarcoma tumors to sorafenib, regorafenib, and pazopanib, and we used tissue microarray (TMA) and primary sarcoma samples to evaluate the frequency and intensity of CSC markers after neoadjuvant therapy with sorafenib and pazopanib.

Doesn't nifedipine inhibit L-type calcium channels?,no,"Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, reduced the expression of synaptogamin and syntaxin and blocked the suppressive effect of vecuronium, suggesting that both agents inhibit presynaptic L-type calcium channels. Treatment with nifedipine to inhibit calcium influx via the L-type channel Cav1.2 (alpha(1C)) inhibited the TGFbeta stimulated increase in ANK expression at all phases of chondrogenesis. Finally, we found that PKCepsilon-induced stellation was significantly reduced by the specific L-type channel blocker nifedipine, indicating that calcium influx through VGCC mediates the change in astrocyte morphology induced by PKCepsilon. However, APV and nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, failed to inhibit LTP when administered following the slow increase in ethanol. Both the metallic ions Cd2+ and Ni2+, known to inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels and T-type channels, respectively, and verapamil and nifedipine, typical blocker of L-type calcium channels completely prevented the hypoxic neuronal NO generation. Further, the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, was able to inhibit the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that at least this phase of the TMT effect was mediated by calcium channels, although nifedipine had no significant effect on the time to reach the maximal [Ca2+]i level Treatment with omega-conotoxin GVIA (3 microM) or nifedipine (10 microM) to inhibit Ca(2+) influx through N- or L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), respectively, also decreased the rate of AP repolarization and increased AP duration Concentrations of nifedipine (10 microM) and nimodipine (3 microM) that maximally inhibit L-type calcium channels reduced the sI(AHP) by 30 and 50%, respectively Consequently, it was demonstrated in the present study that nimodipine and nitrendipine inhibit both L- and N-type calcium channels and thus seem to be unique among the dihydropyridines examined in their effects on calcium channels in dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG 108-15 cells, whereas nifedipine and niguldipine appear to block mainly L-type calcium channels However, APV and nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, failed to inhibit LTP when administered following the slow increase in ethanol Calcium-channel antagonists, omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx GVIA; N-type), nifedipine (L-type), and omega-conotoxin MVIIC (omega-CmTx MVIIC; P/Q type), were used to characterize the voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels (VOCCs) involved in this release The T- and L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) mibefradil attenuates leg edema induced by the L-type CCB nifedipine in the spontaneously hypertensive rat: a novel differentiating assay. L-type calcium channel antagonist nifedipine reduces neurofilament restitution following traumatic optic nerve injury. Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, restores the hypnotic response in rats made tolerant to the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine. Comparison of L-type calcium channel blockade by nifedipine and/or cadmium in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Nifedipine inhibits picrotoxin-induced seizure activity: further evidence on the involvement of L-type calcium channel blockers in epilepsy."
Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling?,yes,"The aim of this brief paper is to highlight new developments in understanding the cardioprotective role of thyroid hormone in reverting regulatory networks involved in adverse cardiac remodeling. Thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1) is shown to be critical for the maturation of cardiomyocytes and for the cellular response to stress. TRα1 is altered during post ischemic cardiac remodeling but the physiological significance of this response is not fully understood.  AMI induces downregulation of thyroid hormone signaling and pharmacological inhibition of TRα1 further depresses post-ischemic cardiac function. These findings reveal crucial roles for Dio3 in heart function and remodeling, which may have pathophysiologic implications for human restrictive cardiomyopathy. TH administration after AMI prevented tissue hypothyroidism and resulted in decreased beta-MHC expression, increased wall thickening and normalized wallstress, while stretch-induced p38 MAPK activation was increased. We conclude that diabetes exacerbates post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and that tissue hypothyroidism may be involved in this response. Thyroid hormone can favorably remodel the diabetic myocardium after acute myocardial infarction. It has been previously shown that regulators of physiological growth such as thyroid hormone (TH) can favorably remodel the post ischaemic myocardium. Acute myocardial infarction in diabetic rats results in TH receptor down-regulation with important physiological consequences. TH treatment prevents this response and improves cardiac hemodynamics. TH affects cardiac remodeling by limiting reperfusion injury, and, at later states, by inducing distinct changes in cardiac chamber geometry in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, administration of TH can convert pathologic to physiologic hypertrophy. These effects are the result of favorable cellular remodeling. Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical in cardiac cell differentiation (regulating contractile proteins and cell geometry) and this effect could be potentially exploited therapeutically in reversing the process of de-differentiation which underlies postischemic cardiac remodeling.  TH treatment partially reverses cardiac dysfunction in rats with old myocardial infarction by favorably changing cardiac chamber geometry and expression of myosin isoforms. Thyroid hormone, unlike current treatments, appears to be a paradigm of therapeutic intervention which aims at restoring cardiac geometry and may prove new effective treatment for heart failure. Changes in thyroid hormone (TH)-TH receptors (TRs) axis occur in the course of post-infarction cardiac remodeling and seem to contribute to cardiac fetal phenotype. TH can ""rebuild"" the post-infarcted heart by preventing the fetal-like pattern of contractile proteins expression, normalizing wall tension, and optimizing cardiac chamber geometry.  TH, apart from its ""classical"" actions on cardiac contractility and heart rhythm, appears to regulate various intracellular signaling pathways related to stress responses and cardiac remodelling. More importantly, experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that TH can limit ischaemic injury, attenuate cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac hemodynamics.  Thyroid hormone attenuates cardiac remodeling and improves hemodynamics early after acute myocardial infarction in rats. Thyroid hormone administration early after infarction attenuates cardiac remodeling and significantly improves myocardial performance. It has previously been shown that thyroid hormone can reverse cardiac remodeling in failing hearts by reducing myocardial wall stress due to the unique changes induced in cardiac myocyte shape."
Is there an association between borna virus and brain tumor?,no,"Borna disease virus (BDV), a nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus, infects a wide variety of mammalian species and readily establishes a long-lasting, persistent infection in brain cells.  To investigate the biological characteristics of field isolates of Borna disease virus (BDV), as well as to understand BDV infections outside endemic countries, we isolated the virus from brain samples of a heifer with Borna disease in Japan. Neonatal Borna disease virus (BDV) infection of the rat brain is associated with microglial activation and damage to the certain neuronal populations. In addition, compared to uninfected mixed cultures, activation of microglia in BDV-infected mixed cultures was associated with a significantly greater lipopolysaccharide-induced release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 10. Taken together, the present data are the first in vitro evidence that persistent BDV infection of neurons and astrocytes rather than direct exposure to the virus or dying neurons is critical for activating microglia. Usually, Borna disease virus is not cleared from the brain but rather persists in neural cells. Varied persistent life cycles of Borna disease virus in a human oligodendroglioma cell line. Borna disease virus (BDV) establishes a persistent infection in the central nervous system of vertebrate animal species as well as in tissue cultures.  Thus, our findings show that BDV may have established a persistent infection at low levels of viral expression in OL cells with the possibility of a latent infection. These results suggested that BDV infection may cause direct damage in the developing brain by inhibiting the function of amphoterin due to binding by the p24 phosphoprotein. We describe a model for investigating disorders of central nervous system development based on neonatal rat infection with Borna disease virus, a neurotropic noncytolytic RNA virus.  Borna disease virus (BDV) replicates in brain cells. The neonatally infected rat with BDV exhibits developmental-neuromorphological abnormalities, neuronal cytolysis, and multiple behavioral and physiological alterations.  Borna disease virus (BDV) causes central nervous system (CNS) disease in several vertebrate species, which is frequently accompanied by behavioral abnormalities. Intrinsic responses to Borna disease virus infection of the central nervous system. Immune cells invading the central nervous system (CNS) in response to Borna disease virus (BDV) antigens are central to the pathogenesis of Borna disease (BD).  We report here the partial purification and characterization of cell-free BDV from the tissue culture supernatant of infected human neuroblastoma SKNSH cells. We have used the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique to gain insight into the pathogenesis of encephalitis caused by Borna disease virus (BDV).  In contrast, in the BDV-infected primary mixed cultures, we observed proliferation of microglia cells that acquired the round morphology and expressed major histocompatibility complex molecules of classes I and II."
Is miR-126 involved in heart failure?,yes,"he miRNAs miR-126 and miR-508-5p are associated with the outcome of ICM and NICM patients with CHF. These two miRNAs could be useful in the diagnosis of CHF patients, and might provide novel targets for prevention and treatment of CHF. The plasma concentration of miR-126 was negatively correlated with age and NYHA class, and could be a useful biomarker for heart failure. In 10 patients with heart failure, plasma concentrations of miR-126 were up-regulated with improvement of the NYHA class from IV to III."
Can't the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,no,"6-Shogaol reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and released cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol via Bax activation.  Moreover, overexpression of ERβ prevented Bax activation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage during apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that EV71 infection altered Bax conformation and triggered its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria in RD cells. Subsequently, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria to cytosol. associated with translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation.  Once activated, BAK and BAX form proteolipid pores in the OMM leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and the release of inner membrane space proteins, such as cytochrome c, which promotes caspase activation.   Our results showed that OC induced a caspase-dependent apoptosis by triggering a series of events in HeLa cells including Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, chromosome fragmentation followed by caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage and eventually cell death.  Bax plays a key role in intrinsic apoptotic signaling in neurons by allowing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c."
Is polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?,no,"The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation.  Most eukaryotic genes express mRNAs with alternative polyadenylation sites at their 3' ends Polyadenylation is the non-template addition of adenosine nucleotides at the 3'-end of RNA, which occurs after transcription and generates a poly(A) tail up to 250-300 nucleotides long. Polyadenylation is a process of endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, followed by addition of up to 250 adenosine residues to the 3' end of the mRNA. Plant mitochondrial polyadenylated mRNAs are degraded by a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity, which proceeds unimpeded by stable secondary structures. We show that a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity is responsible for the preferential degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs as compared with non-polyadenylated mRNAs, and that 20-30 adenosine residues constitute the optimal poly(A) tail size for inducing degradation of RNA substrates in vitro. The diversity of polyadenylation sites suggests that mRNA polyadenylation in prokaryotes is a relatively indiscriminate process that can occur at all mRNA's 3'-ends and does not require specific consensus sequences as in eukaryotes. Polyadenylation of premessenger RNAs occurs posttranscriptionally in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells by cleavage of the precursor and polymerization of adenosine residues. However, under certain conditions, poly(A) tracts may lead to mRNA stabilization. From these results, we propose that in plant mitochondria, poly(A) tails added at the 3' ends of mRNAs promote an efficient 3'- to 5'- degradation process.. Auxiliary downstream elements are required for efficient polyadenylation of mammalian pre-mRNAs. Transcription in these cells is polycistronic. Tens to hundreds of protein-coding genes of unrelated function are arrayed in long clusters on the same DNA strand. Polycistrons are cotranscriptionally processed by trans-splicing at the 5' end and polyadenylation at the 3' end, generating monocistronic units ready for degradation or translation We have devised a simple chromatographic procedure which isolates five polyadenylation factors that are required for polyadenylation of eukaryotic mRNA.  During mammalian oocyte maturation, protein synthesis is mainly controlled through cytoplasmic polyadenylation of stored maternal mRNAs. Identification and characterization of a polyadenylated small RNA (s-poly A+ RNA) in dinoflagellates. Thus, polyadenylation seems to be a major component of the RNA editing machinery that affects overlapping genes in animal mitochondria. Pre-mRNA 3'-end processing, the process through which almost all eukaryotic mRNAs acquire a poly(A) tail is generally inhibited during the cellular DNA damage Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs possess 3' ends with a polyadenylate (poly(A)) tail. We previously demonstrated, by limited mutagenesis, that conserved sequence elements within the 5' end of influenza virus virion RNA (vRNA) are required for the polyadenylation of mRNA in vitro. Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors by poly(A) polymerase depends on two specificity factors and their recognition sequences The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed by 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation Formation of mRNA 3' termini involves cleavage of an mRNA precursor and polyadenylation of the newly formed end.  The polyadenylation of RNA is a near-universal feature of RNA metabolism in eukaryotes. The mechanism of RNA degradation in Escherichia coli involves endonucleolytic cleavage, polyadenylation of the cleavage product by poly(A) polymerase, and exonucleolytic degradation by the exoribonucleases,  The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a process common to almost all organisms.  The addition of poly(A) tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to all organisms examined so far.  The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to almost all organisms.  Polyadenylation contributes to the destabilization of bacterial mRNA."
Is thrombophilia related to increased risk of miscarriage?,yes,"Thrombophilia does hardly increase the risk of IUGR/PMPC or if so, it can be prevented by LMWH for illustrative purposes, a patient presenting with combined thrombophilia--both genetic and acquired--will be discussed. This patient had suffered severe gestational complications that led to devastating obstetrical outcome Thrombophilias have been implicated in complications related to ischemic placental disease including recurrent pregnancy loss, intrauterine fetal demise, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and preterm delivery Further information about the combined risk of aPC resistance and pregnancy is needed before guidance on the management of affected women can be formulated. Thrombotic risk during pregnancy and the puerperium is higher in asymptomatic women with than without thrombophilia Further studies are required to assess the thrombotic risk in women with preeclampsia as well as early or late recurrent pregnancy loss. Risk of pregnancy-related venous thrombosis in carriers of severe inherited thrombophilia In conclusion, homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and, to a lesser extent, double heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and of the prothrombin mutation have an increased risk of venous thrombosis during pregnancy, particularly high during the postpartum period Careful diagnosis, observation and monitoring can add significant benefit to LMWH therapy during pregnancy Pregnancy in healthy women is accompanied by hypercoagulable changes that may interact with thrombophilia risk factors and threaten pregnancy. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies) mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the postpartum period When counseling white women with a history of preeclampsia, screening for thrombophilia can be useful for preconceptional counseling and pregnancy management. knowledge combined with the appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis and treatment in women who have objectively confirmed VTE continue to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes The risk of having thrombophilia is doubled in men who have fathered pregnancies which ended in perinatal death as well as in the mothers of such pregnancies. The prevalence of thrombophilic variants is of possible public health significance for other morbidity; but perhaps not in relation to preeclampsia This study suggests that thrombophilia ""mediates"" in lowering of cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia"
Aren't Alu elements transcribed?,no,"Alu RNAs in the human transcriptome Alu elements can be transcribed in two different ways, by two independent polymerases 'Free Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol III from their own promoter 'embedded Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol II as part of protein- and non-protein-coding RNAs Recent studies have demonstrated that both free and embedded Alu RNAs play a major role in post transcriptional regulation of gene expression Alu RNAs transcribed from these elements are present at low levels at normal cell growth but various stress conditions increase their abundance Alu RNAs are known to bind the cognate proteins SRP9/14 Increased level of polymerase III transcribed Alu RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue we used primer extension analysis to determine the level of polymerase III directed Alu RNA and found an increased expression of Alu RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma Widespread RNA editing of embedded alu elements in the human transcriptome Transcribed Alu sequences can alter splicing patterns by generating new exons In the vast majority of edited RNAs, A-to-I substitutions are clustered within transcribed sense or antisense Alu sequences Alu-associated RNA editing may be a mechanism for marking nonstandard transcripts, not destined for translation the case of transcribed Alus Differential levels of Alu RNA during different conditions of stress also await clear functional understanding Alu expression in human cell lines and their retrotranspositional potential Alu expression likely varies by cell type, growth conditions and transformation state The vast majority of Alu loci potentially transcribed by RNA pol III lack important sequence features for retrotransposition and the majority of potentially active Alu loci in the genome (scored high ERP) belong to young Alu subfamilies We suggest that the genomic sequences upstream from most Alu elements and 7SL pseudogenes do not contain this element, and consequently that only a small subset of such sequences can be transcribed in vivo. These similarities suggest that some Alu family sequences are mobile genetic elements that can transpose to new chromosomal loci using as an intermediate a cDNA copy of an RNA transcribed from the Alu family element by RNA polymerase III. Primate and rodent genomes are populated with hundreds of thousands copies of Alu and B1 elements dispersed by retroposition, i.e., by genomic reintegration of their reverse transcribed RNAs. Members of this family are readily transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase III, but RNA corresponding to only a small sub-set of Alu elements has been found in vivo. Alu interspersed repetitive elements possess internal RNA polymerase III promoters which are strongly transcribed in vitro, yet these elements are nearly silent in somatic cells. The amplification of genomic Alu elements by retroposition, i.e. by reintegration of reverse-transcribed RNA, suggests that Alu RNA plays an important role in this process. We report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of Alu RNAs transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed Alu elements. The results of this study indicate that Alu and 7SL RNA gene sequences interact with cellular factors that are important for HeLa cell proliferation and suggest that these pol III-transcribed elements may be involved in the regulation of cellular growth. Then we used primer extension analysis to determine the level of polymerase III directed Alu RNA and found an increased expression of Alu RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma Alu interspersed repetitive elements possess internal RNA polymerase III promoters which are strongly transcribed in vitro, yet these elements are nearly silent in somatic cells 'Free Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol III from their own promoter, while 'embedded Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol II as part of protein- and non-protein-coding RNAs We report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of Alu RNAs transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed Alu elements Transcribed Alu sequences can alter splicing patterns by generating new exons, but other impacts of intragenic Alu elements on their host RNA are largely unexplored Both 7SL genes and Alu elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and we show here that the internal 7SL promoter lies within the Alu-like part of the 7SL gene Each group revealed a divergent pattern of transcribed Alu elements"
Doesn't do the human lncRNA LINC-PINT promote tumorigenesis?,yes,"The human lncRNA LINC-PINT inhibits tumor cell invasion through a highly conserved sequence element. Here we characterize the function of the p53-regulated human lncRNA LINC-PINT in cancer. We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. A cross-species analysis identifies a highly conserved sequence element in LINC-PINT that is essential for its function. This sequence mediates a specific interaction with PRC2, necessary for the LINC-PINT-dependent repression of a pro-invasion signature of genes regulated by the transcription factor EGR1. We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. These results thus indicate that low plasma Linc-pint expression could serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for early PCa detection, and that low Linc-pint levels in PCa tumors could be used for predicting patient prognosis. Our data demonstrate that Linc-pint expression is lower in plasma samples from PCa patients than from healthy individuals, and indicate that plasma Linc-pint levels are more sensitive than CA19-9 for detecting PCa. Low plasma Linc-pint levels correlate with tumor recurrence, while low tumor Linc-pint levels correlate with poor prognosis for PCa patients after pancreatectomy. We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.

Aren't stress granules membraneous?,yes,"PMLOs are different in size, shape, and composition, and almost invariantly contain intrinsically disordered proteins (e.g., eIF4B and TDP43 in stress granules, Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RNA-binding proteins plays an important role in the formation of multiple membrane-less organelles involved in RNA metabolism, including stress granules. Stress granules (SG) are membrane-less compartments involved in regulating mRNAs during stress.  In addition to membrane delimited organelles, proteins and RNAs can organize themselves into specific domains. Some examples include stress granules and subnuclear bodies."
Isn't Dicer part of the RISC loading complex?,no,"Dicer is a component of the protein machinery (the RNA Induced Silencing Complex [RISC]) which is involved in catalyzing the formation of mature microRNAs from their precursors in the process of microRNA biogenesis. RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) Proteins PACT, TRBP, and Dicer are SRA binding nuclear receptor coregulators. The cytoplasmic RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) contains dsRNA binding proteins, including protein kinase RNA activator (PACT), transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP), and Dicer, that process pre-microRNAs into mature microRNAs (miRNAs) that target specific mRNA species for regulation.   Although the major RNAi pathway proteins are found in most subcellular compartments, the miRNA- and siRNA-loaded Ago2 populations co-sediment almost exclusively with the rER membranes, together with the RISC loading complex (RLC) factors Dicer, TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) and protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT). RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are liberated from double-stranded (ds)RNA precursors by Dicer and guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to targets. . Dicer, an RNase III enzyme, plays a central role in the RNAi pathway by cleaving precursors of both of these classes of RNAs to form mature siRNAs and miRNAs, which are then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).  Canonical siRNAs are 21 nucleotides (nt) in length and are loaded to the RNA Induced Silencing Complex when introduced into the cells, while longer siRNA molecules are first processed by endogenous Dicer and thus termed Dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA)."
Are chromomethylases present in animal genomes?,no,"Many plant, animal, and fungal genomes contain cytosine DNA methylation in asymmetric sequence contexts (CpHpH, H = A, T, C). However, at the SUPERMAN locus, asymmetric methylation was only completely abolished in drm1 drm2 chromomethylase 3 (cmt3) triple mutant plants. Although neither the drm1 drm2 double mutants nor the cmt3 single mutants show morphological defects, drm1 drm2 cmt3 triple mutant plants show pleiotropic effects on plant development. Arabidopsis cmt3 chromomethylase mutations block non-CG methylation and silencing of an endogenous gene. The lack of CMT homologs in animal genomes could account for the observation that in contrast to plants, animals maintain primarily CG methylation. Dual binding of chromomethylase domains to H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes directs DNA methylation in plants. A role for CHROMOMETHYLASE3 in mediating transposon and euchromatin silencing during egg cell reprogramming in Arabidopsis. During embryogenesis there is a major switch from dependence upon maternally-deposited products to reliance on products of the zygotic genome. Expression analysis of eight putative tomato DNA methyltransferases encoding genes showed that one chromomethylase (CMT) and two rearranged methyltransferases (DRMs) are preferentially expressed in the pericarp during fruit growth and could be involved in the locus-specific increase of methylation observed at this developmental phase in the pericarp. Natural variation for alleles under epigenetic control by the maize chromomethylase zmet2. Arabidopsis has two types of methyltransferases with demonstrated maintenance activity: MET1, which maintains CpG methylation and is homologous to mammalian DNMT1, and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), which maintains CpNpG (N = A, T, C, or G) methylation and is unique to the plant kingdom. Maize chromomethylase Zea methyltransferase2 is required for CpNpG methylation. A cytosine DNA methyltransferase containing a chromodomain, Zea methyltransferase2 (Zmet2), was cloned from maize. The sequence of ZMET2 is similar to that of the Arabidopsis chromomethylases CMT1 and CMT3, with C-terminal motifs characteristic of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases. We have detected a chromodomain embedded within the catalytic region of a predicted Arabidopsis DNA methyltransferase that is diverged from other eukaryotic enzymes. The 791 residue ""chromomethylase"" (CMT1) is encoded by a floral transcript that is spliced from 20 exons and is present at only approximately 1/10(-7) of total mRNA."

This genetic defect shows sex linked inheritance and a marked heterogeneity. G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in the world.  Study of the deficiency pattern amongst family members of the enzyme deficient subjects confirmed the X-linked inheritance of G-6-PD deficiency.

Is pregabalin effective for treatment of patients with restless leg syndrome?,yes,"CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated improvements in objective and subjective measures of sleep maintenance and sleep architecture with pregabalin compared with placebo and pramipexole. Effects of pregabalin on periodic limb movement arousal index were comparable to pramipexole.  CONCLUSIONS: Pregabalin provided significantly improved treatment outcomes as compared with placebo, and augmentation rates were significantly lower with pregabalin than with 0.5 mg of pramipexole. The alpha-2-delta ligands, including gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin, are effective for RLS without known occurrence of augmentation or impulse control disorders, although sedation and dizziness can occur.  Pregabalin has been established as effective for up to 1 year in treating RLS/WED (Level A evidence).  In the group of anticonvulsants, only the trials performed with α₂δ ligands such as gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin showed good efficacy.  Alternative or additional pharmacologic treatment with a lower level of overall quality of evidence includes opioids (codeine, tramadol, and oxycodone) and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin).  There is sufficient evidence to conclude that dopamine agonists such as rotigotine transdermal patch, pramipexole, ropinirole, gabapentin enacarbil, pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in the short-term treatment of RLS and rotigotine, followed by gabapentin enacarbil, ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin for long-term treatment. Calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin) provide alternative therapies for RLS especially in patients with augmentation, impulse control disorders, or hypersomnia induced by dopamine agonists.  Alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin, and pregabalin) increased the number of IRLS responders (RR=1.66; [95% CI: 1.33 to 2.09], k=3, high strength of evidence) and mean change in IRLS symptom scores (k=3, high strength of evidence).  RECOMMENDATIONS: Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment for RLS. Therapies with an OPTION level of recommendation include carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, clonidine, and for patients with low ferritin levels, iron supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-week phase 2b study, pregabalin reduced RLS symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe idiopathic RLS CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that pregabalin is effective for the treatment of restless legs syndrome and improves sleep architecture and periodic limb movements in placebo-unresponsive patients. In severe, refractory or neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used. The alpha-2-delta ligands, including gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin, are effective for RLS without known occurrence of augmentation or impulse control disorders, although sedation and dizziness can occur This study provides Class II evidence that pregabalin is effective for the treatment of restless legs syndrome and improves sleep architecture and periodic limb movements in placebo-unresponsive patients. Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment for RLS"
Isn't arimoclomol a co-inducer of the heat shock response?,no,"Arimoclomol is a hydroxylamine derivative, a group of compounds which have unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression, but only under conditions of cellular stress.  In this review we summarize the evidence for the neuroprotective effects of enhanced heat shock protein expression by Arimoclomol and other inducers of the Heat Shock Response.  arimoclomol, a co-inducer of the heat shock stress response, The heat-shock response (HSR) was activated in P23H retinae, and this was enhanced with arimoclomol treatment.   We also assessed these functions in mice treated with a known heat shock protein inducer, arimoclomol.  Under conditions of excessive stress, arimoclomol induces amplification of the cytoprotective heat shock response in order to protect motor neurons from death.  Although both arimoclomol and celastrol induced the expression of Hsp70 Arimoclomol, an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in cellular stress response, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in recent years. The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression.  Arimoclomol is an investigational drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that amplifies heat shock protein gene expression during cell stress. Arimoclomol, a coinducer of heat shock proteins, delayed progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a mouse model in which motor neurons in the spinal cord and motor cortex degenerate."
Are there plasma membrane receptors for thyroid hormones?,yes,"ntegrins are heterodimeric structural components of the plasma membrane whose ligands include a large number of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  Recently, integrin αvβ3 has been shown to have a panel of previously unappreciated small molecule receptor sites for thyroid hormone and hormone analogues, for dihydrotestosterone, and for resveratrol, a polyphenol that has certain estrogen-like features. The integrin receptor activation by T4 may take a role in plasma membrane processes involved in the male reproductive system. Rapid signaling via this plasma membrane binding site appears to be responsible for many nongenomic effects of thyroid hormones, independent of the classic nuclear receptors."
Do plant genomes contain CpG islands?,yes,"This study represents the first systematic genome-scale analysis of DNA curvature, CpG islands and tandem repeats at the DNA sequence level in plant genomes, and finds that not all of the chromosomes in plants follow the same rules common to other eukaryote organisms, suggesting that some of these genomic properties might be considered as specific to plants In plant genomes, there exist discrete regions rich in CpG dinucleotides, namely CpG clusters. In rice, most of these CpG clusters are associated with genes. Rice genes are grouped into one of the five classes according to the position of an associated CpG cluster. Among them, class 1 genes, which harbor a CpG cluster at the 5'-terminus, share similarities with human genes having CpG islands Segmental distribution of genes harboring a CpG island-like region on rice chromosomes Highly-expressed Arabidopsis genes had overall a more marked GC-skew in the TSS compared to genes with low expression levels. We therefore propose that the GC-skew around the TSS in some plants and fungi is related to transcription. It might be caused by mutations during transcription initiation or the frequent use of transcription factor-biding sites having a strand preference. In addition, GC-skew is a good candidate index for TSS prediction in plant genomes, where there is a lack of correlation among CpG islands and genes Preliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward. Nevertheless, because the landscape of CpG/CpNpG islands differs considerably between promoters and introns on the one side and exons (whether coding or not) on the other, more sophisticated approaches can probably be developed for the successful detection of ""putative"" CpG and CpNpG islands in plants This study represents the first systematic genome-scale analysis of DNA curvature, CpG islands and tandem repeats at the DNA sequence level in plant genomes, and finds that not all of the chromosomes in plants follow the same rules common to other eukaryote organisms, suggesting that some of these genomic properties might be considered as specific to plants. These plant CpG-rich clusters satisfied the criteria used for identifying human CpG islands, which suggests that these CpG clusters may be regarded as plant CpG islands.

Is there association of matrix metalloproteinases with behaviour of pituitary adenomas?,yes,"While detailed histological subtyping remains the best independent predictor of aggressive behavior in the majority of cases, evidence suggests that the additional analyses of FGFR4, MMP, PTTG, Ki-67, p53, and deletions in chromosome 11 may contribute to decisions concerning management of aggressive pituitary adenomas. We observed elevation of MMP-2 and -9 expression and consequent 3-D cell invasion in cells under-expressing RECK.   Based on the significance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for tumor growth and angiogenesis, we have studied the effect of batimastat (BB-94), a synthetic MMPs inhibitor (MMPI) on the progression of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma in rats.  Inhibition of estrogen-induced pituitary tumor growth and angiogenesis in Fischer 344 rats by the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat. The results of our study provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of batimastat, a synthetic MMPI, on the growth and angiogenesis in an experimental model of human prolactinoma. In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis. Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  We found no correlation of MMP-9 expression and tumour invasion. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes. CONCLUSIONS: TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasive pituitary adenomas to biological behavior. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-containing endopeptidases that are able to degrade the extracellular matrix and allow angiogenesis and tumor invasion.  MMP-9 expression did not differ between noninvasive tumors and normal pituitary gland, or between different sized prolactinomas. MMP-9 expression was related to aggressive tumor behavior. It was higher in invasive macroprolactinomas (P = 0.003) when compared with noninvasive macroprolactinomas or the normal anterior pituitary gland. In addition, although there was no difference in whether MMP-9 was present or not when nonfunctioning adenomas that recurred were compared with those that did not, samples of recurrent tumor at the second presentation were more likely to express MMP-9 (P = 0.01). Pituitary carcinomas were significantly more likely to be MMP-9 positive compared with normal anterior pituitary gland (P = 0.05), but there was no difference from invasive adenomas. Angiogenesis assessed by vascular density was related to MMP-9 expression (P<0.05). In summary, we have shown the presence of MMP-9 expression in some invasive and recurrent pituitary adenomas, and in the majority of pituitary carcinoma. The mechanisms whereby MMP-9 expression influences tumor recurrence and invasiveness, and its association with angiogenesis, remains to be elucidated.  Beside the digestion of the extracellular matrix during tumor invasion and metastasis, more recently, new functions for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been proposed.  CONCLUSION: No correlation could be established between the invasive potential of tumors and MMP-1, -2, and -3 expression levels.  Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.  We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0.039) or the expression of VEGF (P &lt; 0.001) and MMP-9 (P &lt; 0.001). But c-myc LI and bcl-2 expression have no association with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas (P = 0.061 vs. nm23 and MMP-9 have associations with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas, Matrix metalloproteinase secreted by pituitary cells can release growth factors from the extracellular matrix that, in turn, control pituitary cell proliferation and hormone secretion. In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis. There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0.039) or the expression of VEGF (P &lt; 0.001) and MMP-9 (P &lt; 0.001). Although our study has shown that MVD and the expression of VEGF, Ki-67, nm23 and MMP-9 have associations with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas, they are lack of specificity."
Is Solanezumab effective for Alzheimer's Disease?,no,"An analysis of publicly available data from the Phase II studies for bapineuzumab and solanezumab indicates that neither compound produced compelling evidence of drug-like behavior that would justify their progression into pivotal trials.  Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid β monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.  For example, Eli Lilly announced a major change to its closely watched clinical trial for the Alzheimer's drug solanezumab which failed to reach statistical significance.  Areas covered: This contradiction prompted us to review all study phases of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), Bapineuzumab, Solanezumab, Avagacestat and Dimebolin to shed more light on these recent failures.   Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing. Subsequent analysis of pooled data from both phase III trials with solanezumab showed a reduction in cognitive decline in patients with mild AD. Secondary analyses of EXPEDITION studies suggested a smaller functional effect of solanezumab relative to cognition. An increasing effect of solanezumab over 18 months was shown for cognition and function. RESULTS: In the mild AD population, less cognitive and functional decline was observed with solanezumab (n = 659) versus placebo (n = 663), measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale Instrumental ADLs.  The promising results obtained with aducanumab and solanezumab against Alzheimer's disease (AD) strengthen the vaccine approach to prevent AD, despite of the many clinical setbacks.  CONCLUSIONS: Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid, failed to improve cognition or functional ability.  Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing."
Isn't autosomal dominant inheritanced form of Osteogenesis imperfecta caused by mutations in the genes associated with collagen production?,no,"steogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous bone disorder characterized by recurrent fractures. Although most cases of OI have heterozygous mutations inCOL1A1orCOL1A2and show autosomal dominant inheritance, Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk. The majority of OI cases have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are usually caused by mutations in genes encoding type I collagen  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by low bone mass and recurrent fractures. Most OI cases follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are attributed to mutations in genes encoding type I collagen (COL1A1/COL1A2).  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterised by low bone mineral density resulting in fractures. 85-90% of patients with OI carry a variant in the type 1 collagen genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, which follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by susceptibility to bone fractures, and range in severity from a subtle increase in fracture frequency to death in the perinatal period. Most patients have defects in type I collagen biosynthesis with autosomal-dominant inheritance, but many autosomal-recessive genes have been reported. To investigate mutation of COL1A1 gene and analyze the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in a family with osteogenesis imperfecta Dominant inheritance of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes that encode type I collagen, Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of bone formation, resulting in low bone mass and an increased propensity to fracture. It exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from multiple fractures in utero and perinatal death, to normal adult stature and low fracture incidence. Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I is characterized by bone fragility without significant deformity, osteopenia, normal stature, blue sclerae, and autosomal dominant inheritance. Dermal fibroblasts from most affected individuals produce about half the expected amount of type I collagen, suggesting that the OI type I phenotype results from a variety of mutations which alter the apparent expression of either COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes encoding the chains of type I collagen. Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the COL1A2 and COL1A1 genes of type I collagen.  Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by dominant autosomal mutations in the type I collagen coding genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) in about 85% of individuals, affecting collagen quantity or structure. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders of connective tissue, mainly caused by mutations in the collagen type I genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2). Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. In approximately 90% of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta, mutations in either of the genes encoding the pro-alpha1 or pro-alpha2 chains of type I collagen (COL1A1 or COL1A2) can be identified. Autosomal dominant OI is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. ext-generation sequencing technology was used to screen a panel of known OI genes.RESULTS: In 41 probands, we identified 28 different disease-causing variants of 9 different known OI genes. Eleven of the variants are novel. Ten of the 28 variants are located in COL1A1, five in COL1A2, three in BMP1, three in FKBP10, two in TMEM38B, two in P3H1, and one each in CRTAP, SERPINF1, and SERPINH1.  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures after minimal trauma. OI type V has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and is not caused by mutations in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2.  Detection of a high frequency RsaI polymorphism in the human pro alpha 2(I) collagen gene which is linked to an autosomal dominant form of osteogenesis imperfecta. Osteogenesis imperfecta due to recurrent point mutations at CpG dinucleotides in the COL1A1 gene of type I collagen. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), commonly known as ""brittle bone disease"", is a dominant autosomal disorder characterized by bone fragility and abnormalities of connective tissue. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies have shown that the vast majority of affected individuals have mutations in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes that encode the chains of type I procollagen.  Osteogenesis imperfecta is normally caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2."
Do orphan and gene related CpG islands follow power-law-like distributions?,yes,"Orphan and gene related CpG Islands follow power-law-like distributions in several genomes: evidence of function-related and taxonomy-related modes of distribution. Here, an investigation of their distributional characteristics in a variety of genomes is undertaken for both whole CGI populations as well as for CGI subsets that lie away from known genes (gene-unrelated or ""orphan"" CGIs). In both cases power-law-like linearity in double logarithmic scale is found.  Our results on power-law-like linearity found in orphan CGI populations suggest that the observed distributional pattern is independent of the analogous pattern that protein coding segments were reported to follow.

Does neuroglobin has neuroprotective properties in the setting of traumatic brain injury?,yes,"Neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral hypoxia, and therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Neuroglobin (Ngb) is proposed to be a neuron-specific, hypoxia-responsive, neuroprotective protein.  CONCLUSION: The increased expression of neuroglobin in traumatic brain injury informed us that neuroglobin had anti-apoptosis action in post-injury neuron. It could protect the neuron from traumatic stress and secondary ischemia and hypoxia insults during ultra-early and acute stages. Neuroglobin-overexpression reduces traumatic brain lesion size in mice. BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that over-expression of Neuroglobin (Ngb) is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic brain injuries.  CONCLUSION: Ngb over-expression reduced traumatic lesion volume, which might partially be achieved by decreasing oxidative stress. Neuroglobin upregulation offers neuroprotection in traumatic brain injury. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate rat neuroglobin (rNGB) expression level after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and further study its neuroprotective effects in TBI when it was overexpressed in adenoviral vector. CONCLUSIONS: NGB was upregulated in TBI and overexpressed rNGB had a significant neuroprotection in TBI.  This study suggested that rNGB overexpression may be a new strategy for treating of TBI. Neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral hypoxia, and therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to investigate rat neuroglobin (rNGB) expression level after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and further study its neuroprotective effects in TBI when it was overexpressed in adenoviral vector. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that over-expression of Neuroglobin (Ngb) is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic brain injuries. Various studies seem to indicate that neuroglobin is a neuroprotective agent when overexpressed, acting as a potent inhibitor of oxidative and nitrosative stress."
Isn't pesticide exposure associated with polyneuropathy?,no,"As the syndrome occurred after the acute cholinergic syndrome but before organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy, the syndrome was called 'intermediate syndrome'. The characteristic features of the IMS are weakness of the muscles of respiration (diaphragm, intercostal muscles and accessory muscles including neck muscles) and of proximal limb muscles. Accompanying features often include weakness of muscles innervated by some cranial nerves. It is now emerging that the degree and extent of muscle weakness may vary following the onset of the IMS.  Electrophysiological studies following OP poisoning have revealed three characteristic phenomena: (i) repetitive firing following a single stimulus; (ii) gradual reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential followed by an increase with repetitive stimulation (the 'decrement-increment response'); and (iii) continued reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential with repetitive simulation ('decrementing response').  Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy is a sensory-motor distal axonopathy which usually occurs after exposure of certain OP insecticides. Neuropathies due to ingestion of OPs have rarely been reported in the literature. We report a patient with serious organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy due to malathion injection. The patient was a 32-year-old female who self-injected undetermined amounts of malathion over the median nerve trace on the forearm crease in a suicide attempt which resulted in peripheral neuropathy.  Acutely, these patients present with cholinergic crisis; intermediate syndrome and delayed polyneuropathy are other sequel of this form of poisoning. There was no strong evidence of irreversible peripheral nerve damage following acute OP poisoning, however further studies are required. Particular interactions are also addressed, such as those of pesticides acting as endocrine disruptors, the cumulative toxicity of organophosphates and organochlorines resulting in estrogenic effects and the promotion of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy. The multivariate analyses showed that the population living in areas with high pesticide use had an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and suicide attempts and that males living in these areas had increased risks for polyneuropathies, affective disorders and suicide attempts.  These compounds cause four important neurotoxic effects in humans: the cholinergic syndrome, the intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND).  An 18-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man were admitted to the hospital with weakness, paresthesia, and gait disturbances at 35 and 22 days, respectively, after ingesting dimethyl-2,2-dichloro vinyl phosphate (DDVP). Neurological examination revealed weakness, vibration sense loss, bilateral dropped foot, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilaterally positive Babinski sign. Electroneurography demonstrated distal motor polyneuropathy with segmental demyelination associated with axonal degeneration prominent in the distal parts of both lower extremities. Sensory complaints and electrodiagnostic findings consistent with polyneuropathy were found in a minority (3/7) of subjects 28 years after an acute toxic arsenic exposure. Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a rare toxicity resulting from exposure to certain organophosphorus (OP) esters.  Therefore, OPIDP may develop only after very large exposures to insecticides, causing severe cholinergic toxicity. Several studies have reported the occurrence of sensory neuropathy with exposure to chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus insecticides, at levels not associated with overt toxicity.  We found no evidence of sensory neuropathy or isolated peripheral abnormalities among subjects with long-term chlorpyrifos exposure at levels known to be associated with the manufacturing process. Persistent, mainly motor, impairment of the peripheral nervous system was found in men two years after OP poisoning, in particular in severe occupational and intentional poisonings with neuropathic OPs. This finding is possibly due to remaining organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy. Besides the well known acute cholinergic toxicity, these compounds may cause late-onset distal polyneuropathy occurring two to three weeks after the acute exposure.  Electromyography demonstrated motor weighed sensory-motor polyneuropathy with axonal degeneration significant in the distal parts of bilateral lower extremities.  The two cases are presented here since organophosphate poisonings are common in our country, and since late-onset polyneuropathy is not a well known clinical presentation as acute toxicity. The course of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) in humans has not been quantitatively measured in epidemiologic studies. The persistence of deficits in motor strength in all severely poisoned patients regardless of pesticide type was unexpected, and may reflect persistent cholinergic blockade or intermediate syndrome, neuropathy, or a combination of these. The findings showed a strong association between exposure to OP concentrate and neurological symptoms, but a less consistent association with sensory thresholds.  Following accidental or suicidal exposure, these anticholinesterases lead to three well defined neurological syndromes i.e. initial life threatening acute cholinergic crisis which often requires management in intensive care unit, intermediate syndrome in which cranial nerve palsies, proximal muscle weakness and respiratory muscle weakness are common and patients often require respiratory support and delayed organophosphate induced polyneuropathy. [Late onset polyneuropathy due to exposure to organophosphates].  Less often a polyneuropathic syndrome of late onset may occur. On electromyography there was sensomotor peripheral polyneuropathy, which was primarily axonal and predominantly motor and distal. Peripheral nerve biopsy confirmed the presence of 'dying back' type axonopathy.  Agricultural workers chronically exposed to organophosphate insecticides, without adequate protection, have an increased risk of developing late onset neuropathy due to organophosphates.  Epidemiologic studies on pesticides have found associations with long-term effects on health mainly in three fields: cancer (especially hematological cancer), neurotoxic effects (polyneuropathy, neuro-behavioral hazards, Parkinson's disease), and reproductive disorders (infertility, birth defects, adverse pregnancy outcomes, perinatal mortality).  EMG studies showed evidence of partial denervation of the anterior tibial group of muscles and flexor digiti minimi in 2 of the 30 workers (6.7%) who underwent EMG examination. Neurological symptoms consist in cerebro-organic disfunctions, locomotory disorders reminiscent of multiple sclerosis or M. Parkinson, and sensory, motoric and vegetative polyneuropathy, leading, for instance, to cardiovascular regulatory disorder like sympathicotonia or, orthostatic hypotonia.  Thirty percent of patients had definite or possible exposure to organophosphate pesticides, and the peak use coincides with the peak incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome. These results suggest that previously reported cases of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy may represent only the worst disease in a spectrum of impairment, a sequela of exposure that may be much more common than previously thought. It is suggested that the main cause of nervous lesions in these cases was the complex effect of pesticides. Delayed polyneuropathy develops within 1 to 3 weeks and abates after 6 to 12 months.  Isolated case reports have circumstantially linked the use of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to polyneuropathy. Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that 2,4-D is an unlikely cause of polyneuropathy. A patient is reported presenting a cerebellar disorder developing about 5 weeks after acute exposure to an organophosphate insecticide.  Less well known, but more complex and idiosyncratic, is the potential for some agents to produce a delayed and progressive polyneuropathy--Organophosphorus Induced Delayed Neurotox-icity (OPIDN).  It is also quite probable that human neurotoxicity may be a potential hazard from exposure to more than the handful of organophosphorus pesticides that have been described in the literature. In the present study the electroencephalograms of 3 of a group 10 workmen, who had been continually exposed to hexachlorcyclohexane, show pathological findings. The electromyograms of 8 of these 10 workman demonstrate a disturbance of the peripherical motoneuron. All probands, who exhibit o pathological EEG, also show a polyneuropathy. Many organophosphorus compounds, including the organophosphate insecticides, may cause polyneuropathy of delayed onset. Nevertheless, we describe a patient with delayed polyneuropathy after suicidal ingestion of parathion. Following acute organophosphorus (OP) poisoning patients complain of numbness without objective sensory abnormalities or other features of OP induced delayed polyneuropathy."
Doesn't PU.1 (SPI1) affect NF-kB binding?,no,"Recent data demonstrate that developmental transcription factors like the macrophage fate-determining Pu.1 set the stage for the activity of ubiquitous transcription factors activated by inflammatory stimuli, like NF-kB, AP-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Within 1217 bp of upstream sequence, 3 sites for NF-kB, 10 sites for NF-IL6, 15 sites for AP1, 6 sites for AP4, 2 sites for CHOP/CEBP alpha and 1 site for SP1 and PU.1 were identified. As little as 82 bp of upstream sequence gave relatively strong luciferase activity, a region containing both a PU.1 and NF-kB site. Potential transcription regulatory elements, AP1, AP2, AP3, NF-kB and GATA recognition sequences, are located within 523 bp upstream of the p35 gene; however, no TATA box was identified. The p40 subunit gene consists of eight exons. A TATA box is located 30 bp upstream from the transcription start site, and AP1, AP3, GATA, and Pu.1 recognition sequences are located within 690 bp upstream of the p40 gene. Several putative binding sequences for ubiquitous (Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and NF-kB) and leukocyte-specific (PU.1) transcription factors have been identified in the proximal region of the CD11c promoter which may participate in the regulation of the expression of p150,95. PU.1 is regulated by NF-kappaB through a novel binding site in a 17 kb upstream enhancer element."
Is there a mouse model for Fanconi anemia?,yes,"Cyclophosphamide promotes engraftment of gene-modified cells in a mouse model of Fanconi anemia without causing cytogenetic abnormalities We compared Cy preconditioning with fludarabine (Flu) or cytarabine (AraC) or no conditioning as a control in fanca ( -/- ) mutant mice receiving gene-modified bone marrow cells We conclude that Cy is an effective and superior preparative regimen with respect to engraftment of lentivirus-transduced cells and functional correction in fanca ( -/- ) mice To study whether there is a causal relationship between FA pathway defects and tumour development, we have generated a mouse model with a targeted disruption of the FA core complex gene Fancf Fancf-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed a phenotype typical for FA cells: they showed an aberrant response to DNA cross-linking agents as manifested by G(2) arrest, chromosomal aberrations, reduced survival, and an inability to monoubiquitinate FANCD2 Fancf homozygous mice were viable, born following a normal Mendelian distribution, and showed no growth retardation or developmental abnormalities. The gonads of Fancf mutant mice functioned abnormally, showing compromised follicle development and spermatogenesis as has been observed in other FA mouse models and in FA patients In a cohort of Fancf-deficient mice, we observed decreased overall survival and increased tumour incidence To provide further experimental access to the FA-M complementation group we have generated Fancm-deficient mice by deleting exon 2 FANCM deficiency caused hypogonadism in mice and hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), thus phenocopying other FA mouse models Fancm(Delta2/Delta2) mice also showed unique features atypical for FA mice, including underrepresentation of female Fancm(Delta2/Delta2) mice and decreased overall and tumor-free survival Fancm-deficient mice reveal unique features of Fanconi anemia complementation group M Fancf-deficient mice are prone to develop ovarian tumours In vivo proliferation advantage of genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells in a mouse model of Fanconi anemia FA-D1 Using an FA mouse model with a marked hematopoietic phenotype, the FA-D1 (Brca2(Delta27/Delta27)) mice, we demonstrate that the lentivirus-mediated gene therapy of FA HSCs results in the progressive expansion of genetically corrected clones in mild-conditioned FA-D1 recipients Consistent with these data, hematopoietic progenitors from FA recipients progressively became mitomycin C resistant and their chromosomal instability was reverted Hematopoietic dysfunction in a mouse model for Fanconi anemia group D1 We have investigated the hematopoietic phenotype of mice with a hypomorphic mutation in the Brca2/Fancd1 gene (Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) mutation) Conventional BM competition experiments showed a marked repopulation defect in Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), compared to wild-type HSCs Moreover, we have observed for the first time in a DNA repair disease model a very significant proliferation defect in Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) HSCs maintained in their natural physiological environment The hematopoietic phenotype associated with the Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) mutation suggests that this FA-D1 mouse model will constitute an important tool for the development of new therapies for FA, including gene therapy In vitro phenotypic correction of hematopoietic progenitors from Fanconi anemia group A knockout mice In this study we characterized the hematopoietic phenotype of a Fanca knockout mouse model and corrected the main phenotypic characteristics of the bone marrow (BM) progenitors using retroviral vectors The hematopoiesis of these animals was characterized by a modest though significant thrombocytopenia, consistent with reduced numbers of BM megakaryocyte progenitors As observed in other FA models, the hematopoietic progenitors from Fanca(-/-) mice were highly sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC) Aiming to correct the phenotype of Fanca(-/-) progenitors, purified Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and human FANCA genes. Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells from Fanca(-/-) mice were transduced with an efficiency similar to that of samples from wild-type mice. More significantly, transductions with FANCA vectors corrected both the MMC hypersensitivity as well as the impaired ex vivo expansion ability that characterized the BM progenitors of Fanca(-/-) mice  The Btbd12 knockout mouse therefore establishes a disease model for Fanconi anemia and genetically links a regulator of nuclease incision complexes to the Fanconi anemia DNA crosslink repair pathway.

Five of these genes have been deleted or mutated in the mouse, as well as a sixth key regulatory gene, to create mouse models of Fanconi anemia. This review summarizes the phenotype of each of the Fanconi anemia mouse models and highlights how genetic and interventional studies using the strains have yielded novel insight into therapeutic strategies for Fanconi anemia and into how the Fanconi anemia pathway protects against genomic instability. To study FA complementation group A using the mouse as a model system, we cloned and characterized the mouse homolog of the human FANCA cDNA.

Doesn't a linker histone exist in the yeast genome?,no,"Hho1p is a bona fide linker histone In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, HHO1 encodes a putative linker histone with very significant homology to histone H1 HHO1p may play a similar role to linker histones, but at restricted locations in the chromatin The putative linker histone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hho1p, has two regions of sequence (GI and GII) that are homologous to the single globular domains of linker histones H1 and H5 in higher eukaryotes.  The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of the linker histone H1, Hho1p, has two domains that are similar in sequence to the globular domain of H1 (and variants such as H5) Two homologous domains of similar structure but different stability in the yeast linker histone, Hho1p Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single linker histone, Hho1p, with two globular domains.  The Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p, with two globular domains, can simultaneously bind to two four-way junction DNA molecules Here, we show in yeast, that the presence of yeast linker histone Hho1p represses expression of a pol II transcribed gene (MET15) embedded in the rDNA. Yeast linker histone Hho1p is required for efficient RNA polymerase I processivity and transcriptional silencing at the ribosomal DNA Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p is not essential for cell viability, and very little is known about its function in vivo.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p functionally interacts with core histone H4 and negatively regulates the establishment of transcriptionally silent chromatin  Unlike canonical linker histones in higher eukaryotes that have a single conserved globular domain, Hho1p possesses two globular domains. We show that the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of Hho1p is dispensable for its function, suggesting that the mode of Hho1p action is similar to that of canonical linker histones To identify new proteins involved in spore nuclear organization, we purified chromatin from mature spores and discovered a significant enrichment of the linker histone (Hho1) Hho1 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed increased genome-wide binding in mature spores and provides novel in vivo evidence of the linker histone binding to nucleosomal linker DNA One of the peculiarities of S. cerevisiae cells is the unusual and less abundant linker histone, Hho1p. Hho1p, the linker histone of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is important for the proper chromatin organization in vivo Characteristically, linker histone depleted chromatin generally exhibited longer chromatin loops than the wild-type.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone-Hho1p maintains chromatin loop organization during ageing. Database homology searching against the complete yeast genome has identified a gene, HHO1, (or YPL127C, formerly LPI17) which encodes a protein that has two regions that show similarity to the pea histone H1 globular domain. Database homology searching against the complete yeast genome has identified a gene, HHO1, (or YPL127C, formerly LPI17) which encodes a protein that has two regions that show similarity to the pea histone H1 globular domain.

Is Turcot syndrome associated with glioblastoma?,yes,"Turcot syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary tumors of the central nervous system and adenomatous colonic polyps during the first or second decades of life, with a spectrum of clinical features such as ""café-au-lait"" spots, axillary freckling, and hyperpigmented spots.  We present the case of a 20-year-old male with a clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme and multiple adenomatous colonic polyps.  Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare hereditary disorder clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary tumors of the colon and the central nervous system (CNS). Here we present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a synchronous clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and colonic adenocarcinoma. Based on this case study, the synchronous presentation of glioblastoma multiforme and adenocarcinoma of the colon might suggest a shorter survival rate for patients with Turcot syndrome.  A 15-year-old boy was admitted with the diagnosis of colonic polyposis, and during a 2-year follow-up, he underwent operation for right parieto-occipital anaplastic astrocytoma, left-side colonic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and cerebella glioblastoma which were all confirmed by histology. Although cases of Turcot's syndrome (TS) (colonic polyposis and primary brain tumour occurring in the same patient) have been previously described, association with haematological malignancy is rare. We hereby report such a case with TS. Type A microsatellite instability in pediatric gliomas as an indicator of Turcot syndrome.  Biallelic mutations of MMR genes are associated with pediatric cancers, including glial tumors, in Turcot syndrome type 1 (TS1). Glioblastomas with giant cell and sarcomatous features in patients with Turcot syndrome type 1: a clinicopathological study of 3 cases. Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare genetic disorder of DNA mismatch repair predisposing to glioblastoma (GBM) in the type 1 variant.  We report the clinicopathological and genetic features of 3 gliomas in TS type 1 patients. We conclude that 1) the giant cell variant of GBM is overrepresented in TS; 2) gliosarcomas may also be encountered; and 3) survival is often favorable, despite histological anaplasia and exuberant proliferation. Malignant transformation of high-grade astrocytoma associated with neurocysticercosis in a patient with Turcot syndrome. A 45-year-old woman with anaplastic astrocytoma was clinically diagnosed with Turcot syndrome, and subsequently developed simultaneous neurocysticercosis and malignant transformation to glioblastoma.  Familial glioblastoma multiforme is a rather uncommon entity, being in most cases associated to known genetic disorders (as Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, etc.).  Turcot syndrome (MIM276300) has been described as the association of central nervous system malignant tumors and familial colorectal cancer and has been reported to be both a dominant and recessive disorder. We report here the first identification of a homozygous mutation in MSH6 in a family with childhood-onset brain tumor, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, and neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotype.  Of the 21 patients, 12 have died (10 after relapse, with a median time to progression for the whole series of 14 months; one with intratumoral bleeding at 40 months after diagnosis; and one affected by Turcot syndrome for duodenal cancer relapse). [Glioblastoma multiforme as a manifestation of Turcot syndrome]. In the present case, a 60-year-old patient with glioblastoma multiforme and a history of hereditary malignomas is described as an example of a HNPCC-associated Turcot's syndrome. Computed tomography brain scan and computed tomography-guided biopsy revealed a left frontoparietal glioblastoma multiforme. This case illustrates the rare presentation of Turcot syndrome-a hereditary colorectal polyposis syndrome-in an older adult. Turcot syndrome is the association of colorectal polyposis with primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma.  Brain tumor is mainly diagnosed as glioblastoma or astrocytoma and mismatch repair genes might be involved.  Patients with Turcot syndrome (TS) are predisposed to colon tumors and primary brain tumors, typically glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. The authors describe a patient with TS featuring a known germline mutation of exon 5 of the hPMS2 mismatch repair gene who developed two metachronous glioblastomas, both with distinct oligodendroglial features. Because this patient had an unusual underlying condition and his tumor had a unique histological appearance for TS, it was hypothesized that this genetic defect may predispose to malignant gliomas with oligodendroglial features.  Turcot Syndrome caused by APC gene develops medulloblastoma and Turcot Syndrome caused by mismatch repair gene develops glioblastoma.  It is characterized by central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms and gastrointestinal polyposis. Seven months after resection of this Dukes' C2 adenocarcinoma, she presented with a second primary CNS tumor, a glioblastoma multiforme. The Turcot syndrome has been defined as the simultaneous presence of multiple polyposis of the colon and a malignant brain tumor. The case of a 47-year-old man submitted to a right hemicolectomy for cancer and polyposis, following a series of endoscopic polypectomies and, finally, removal of left temporal glioma is here presented.  Two of 13 showed microsatellite instability, one of which in a patient with Turcot syndrome, the other in gliomatosis cerebri. The Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare, probably autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by development of primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps.  However, no somatic mutations in APC were found among 91 neuroepithelial tumors (medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma), whether sporadic or associated with TS.  Such syndromes include neurofibromatosis type 2, neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, as well as von Hippel-Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Turcot syndrome.  This patient's case deals with the association between a glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma (WHO Grade III) and colonic adenocarcinoma based on familial polyposis coli.  The authors describe two patients with the association of polyposis-coli and central nervous system tumor (Turcot's syndrome).  We report a case of Turcot's syndrome in a 20-year old man with multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and glioblastoma multiforme.  Another unusual autopsy case of the Turcot syndrome is reported in a 23-year-old woman with polyposis coli, who developed primary carcinoma of the jejunum and glioblastoma multiforme of the left frontal lobe.  Turcot syndrome represents the unique and discrete occurrence of polyposis coli with glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, or both."
Doesn't replication timing affect the rate of somatic mutations?,no,"Here we observe that mutation rate, as reflected in recent evolutionary divergence and human nucleotide diversity, is markedly increased in later-replicating regions of the human genome ll classes of substitutions are affected, suggesting a generalized mechanism involving replication time-dependent DNA damage We show that mutation rate varies 6-fold across a single chromosome, that this variation is correlated with replication timing, and we propose a model to explain this variation that relies on the temporal separation of two processes for replicating past damaged DNA: error-free DNA damage tolerance and translesion synthesis. Recent studies revealed a long suspected replication-timing effect on mutation rate, but the mechanisms that regulate the increase in mutation rate as the genome is replicated remain unclear.  DNA repair systems, in general, are less efficient in late replicating heterochromatic regions compared to early replicating euchromatic regions of the genome. The mutational profile of the yeast genome is shaped by replication the mutation rate increases with the replication timing by more than 30% between the earliest and the latest replicating regions. Thus, we show that the leading replicating strands present an excess of C over G and of A over T in the genome of S. cerevisiae (reciprocally an excess of G + T over C + A in lagging strands) Late-replicating domains have higher divergence and diversity in Drosophila melanogaster Recent evidence also suggests that late replication is associated with high mutability in yeast. Limited evidence from one chromosome arm in Drosophila melanogaster suggests the opposite pattern, with regions overlapping early-firing origins showing increased levels of diversity and divergence The mutation rate for DNA mismatch repair null strains was approximately 1 mutation per genome per generation, 225-fold greater than the wild-type rate. The mutations were distributed randomly throughout the genome, independent of replication timing. Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors in DNA replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified. Here we propose that DNA replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and cancer genomes Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves In addition, certain chromosome rearrangements found in cancer cells and in cells exposed to ionizing radiation display a significant delay in replication timing of >3 hours that affects the entire chromosome(2,3). Recent work from our lab indicates that disruption of discrete cis-acting autosomal loci result in an extremely late replicating phenotype that affects the entire chromosome(4). A conservative estimate is that at least 1-2% of new deleterious mutations affect some aspect of DNA replication, repair, or chromosome segregation. Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. Drake calculates that lytic RNA viruses display spontaneous mutation rates of approximately one per genome while most have mutation rates that are approximately 0.1 per genome (Drake 1993). This constancy of germline mutation rates among microbial species need not necessarily mean constancy of the somatic mutation rates. A recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (RT) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer. DNA replication timing, genome stability and cancer: late and/or delayed DNA replication timing is associated with increased genomic instability. Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. In addition, this method allows for the unambiguous identification of chromosomal rearrangements that correlate with changes in replication timing that affect the entire chromosome."
Don't carmustine wafers improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,no,"At recurrence, treatment options include repeat surgery (with or without Gliadel wafer placement), reirradiation or systemic therapy.  DISCUSSION: Carmustine wafers for primary HGG surgery in accordance with the NICE TA121 were associated with a median survival of 15.3 months; this is improved compared with previously reported randomised trials. Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival. Gliadel wafer is a new approach to the treatment of glioblastoma, which involves controlled release delivery of carmustine from biodegradable polymer wafers. It has shown promising results and provides a silver lining for glioblastoma patients. For patient with and without Gliadel, median and 1-year RFS were 12.9 months and 52% vs. 14 months and 42%, respectively (p = 0.89). According to pathology, Gliadel did not influence OS of patients with Grade III or glioblastoma CONCLUSION: In patients with high-grade gliomas, adding Gliadel before performing a Stupp protocol did not improve survival. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma.  CONCLUSIONS: The combination of aggressive resection, Gliadel wafer implantation, and GKS in addition to standard fractionated RT in selected patients resulted in increased local control and increased survival compared with a historical control group treated with surgery and involved-field RT alone. OBJECT: Gliadel (BCNU) wafer and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) therapy, when used individually as adjuvant therapies, extend survival from that achieved by resection and radiation therapy (XRT) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  BACKGROUND: Gliadel (polifeprosan 20 with carmustine [BCNU] implant) is commonly used for local delivery of BCNU to high-grade gliomas after resection and is associated with increased survival. Temozolomide administered according to this protocol produced a median survival benefit of 2 months in glioblastomas, and carmustine a similar benefit in high-grade gliomas. Analysis of a large trial by Westphal and colleagues (n = 240) showed a 29% risk reduction (P = 0.03) in the BCNU wafer-treated group over the course of the 30-month trial. Median survival of patients treated with BCNU wafers was 13.8 months vs 11.6 months in placebo-treated patients (P = 0.017) with a hazard ratio of 0.73 (P = 0.018), representing a 27% significant risk reduction. This survival advantage was maintained at 1, 2, and 3 years and was statistically significant (P = 0.01) at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Malignant glioma patients treated with BCNU wafers at the time of initial surgery in combination with radiation therapy demonstrated a survival advantage at 2 and 3 years follow-up compared with placebo. OBJECTIVE: Recently a randomized placebo-controlled phase III trial of biodegradable polymers containing carmustine has demonstrated a significant survival benefit for patients treated with local chemotherapy.  CONCLUSION: In this subgroup analysis of a phase III trial population both the clinical progression and radiological progression were significantly delayed in patients treated with local chemotherapy, resulting in an increased survival time. A previous placebo-controlled trial has shown that biodegradable 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers. Median survival in the intent-to-treat group was 13.9 months for the BCNU wafer-treated group and 11.6 months for the placebo-treated group (log-rank P -value stratified by country = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death in the treatment group. When adjusted for factors affecting survival, the treatment effect remained positive with a risk reduction of 28% ( P = 0.03).  Controlled release delivery of carmustine from biodegradable polymer wafers was approved as an adjunct to surgical resection in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme after it was shown in clinical trials to be well tolerated and effective.  Clinical trials have demonstrated significant improvements in survival and quality of life for patients after complete tumour resection and BCNU wafer implantation. BCNU wafers are an effective means of increasing survival and quality of life in patients diagnosed with malignant glioma, and are a valuable addition to the overall multimodal treatment strategy for these tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Carmustine wafer with concurrent TMZ and radiation followed by rotational chemotherapy is a well tolerated, effective therapy, and has a survival benefit compared with radiation alone. Median overall survival in 14 studies of newly-diagnosed patients suggested a modest improvement versus resection followed by Stupp protocol or resection with BCNU wafers, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile. The efficacy of carmustine wafers for older patients with glioblastoma multiforme: prolonging survival. DISCUSSION: Older patients with GBM may benefit from carmustine wafers. The survival for older patients who received carmustine wafers is significantly longer than matched patients who did not receive carmustine wafers. For glioblastoma patients who received ≥90% resection in the BCNU wafer study, median survival increased for BCNU wafer versus placebo (14.5 versus 12.4 months, respectively; P = 0.02), but no survival increase was found for <90% resection (11.7 versus 10.6 months, respectively; P = 0.98). A wafer impregnated with carmustine, for use as an implant after surgical removal of recurrent GBM showed a prolongation in the median survival time of only 2 mo, from 20 to 28 wk in a study with a total of 222 patients.  No clear survival benefit associated with wafer implantation was identified. In three of the trials, patients with GBM who received carmustine wafers had significantly longer median survival than patients who did not receive wafers.  TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials .  The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events.  For patients undergoing repeat resection for malignant glioma, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated a median survival for 110 patients who received carmustine polymers of 31 weeks compared with 23 weeks for 122 patients who only received placebo polymers. Median survival was improved from 11.6 to 13.9 months (P = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death. When patients with glioblastoma multiforme alone were analyzed, the median survival improved from 11.4 to 13.5 months, but this improvement was not statistically significant.  OBJECT: Locoregional chemotherapy with carmustine wafers, positioned at surgery and followed by radiation therapy, has been shown to prolong survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, as has concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival. The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events. However, patients with carmustine wafers demonstrated prolonged survival as compared to patients without wafers. The median survival for patients with carmustine wafers was 8.7 months, while median survival for patients without wafers was 5.5 months (P=0.007). Likewise, in subgroup analysis, patients older than 70 years (P=0.0003) and 75 years (P=0.04) who had carmustine wafers had significantly longer survival than matched patients without wafers. Implantation of carmustine wafers did not significantly improve progression-free survival In three of the trials, patients with GBM who received carmustine wafers had significantly longer median survival than patients who did not receive wafers A previous placebo-controlled trial has shown that biodegradable 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials"
Don't conserved noncoding elements co-occur with matrix-attachment regions?,no,"We hypothesized that some of these regions might be matrix-scaffold attachment regions, MARs (or S/MARs). MARs comprise one of the few classes of eukaryotic noncoding DNA with an experimentally characterized function, being involved in the attachment of chromatin to the nuclear matrix, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the co-occurrence of predicted MARs with highly conserved noncoding DNA regions in human-mouse genomic alignments. We found that 11% of the conserved noncoding DNA consists of predicted MARs. Conversely, more than half of the predicted MARs co-occur with one or more independently identified conserved sequence blocks. An excess of conserved predicted MARs is seen in intergenic regions preceding 5' ends of genes, suggesting that these MARs are primarily involved in transcriptional control A significant fraction of conserved noncoding DNA in human and mouse consists of predicted matrix attachment regions. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the co-occurrence of predicted MARs with highly conserved noncoding DNA regions in human-mouse genomic alignments.

Hasn't IVIG been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease?,no,"Clinical trials of intravenous immunoglobulin for Alzheimer's disease. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that IVIG has anti-amyloid and immune modulatory properties relevant to treating neurodegenerative disorders. In early stage AD clinical trials, IVIG was found to reduce cognitive decline and increase brain glucose metabolism. Unfortunately, IVIG failed to meet primary outcome objectives in the North American Phase 3 clinical trial in mild to moderate AD. While the results of clinical trials to date do not provide support for the use of IVIG to treat AD at the doses tested, additional studies of IVIG's mechanisms are warranted and may guide the development of more effective therapies for AD in the future."
Isn't the ACE inhibitor indicated for lung cancer treatment?,yes,"The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used widely as antihypertensive agents, and it has been suggested that they decrease the risk of some cancers, although available data are conflicting.  Using cell viability and fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis tests, we demonstrated that captopril inhibited the viability of LNM35 cells by inducing apoptosis, providing insight about the mechanisms underlying its antitumorigenic activities. In view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer. In order to determine the mechanism by which captopril inhibited tumor growth, we investigated the impact of this drug on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that captopril treatment significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells (Ki-67) in the tumor samples but was not associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (CD31). Using this model, we demonstrated that daily IP administration of captopril (2.8 mg/mouse) for 3 weeks resulted in a remarkable reduction of tumor growth (58%, P < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (50%, P= 0.088).  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to mitigate radiation-induced lung injury in preclinical models ACE inhibitors may decrease the incidence of radiation pneumonitis in patients receiving thoracic radiation for lung cancer."
Is Vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,yes,"Vortioxetine is an orally administered small molecule developed by Lundbeck A/S for the once-daily treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Vortioxetine received its first global approval for MDD in the USA in September 2013 and regulatory approval for its use in this indication in the EU (where it has received a positive opinion) and Canada is awaited.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of vortioxetine leading to this first approval for MDD. Vortioxetine was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. On the primary efficacy endpoint, both vortioxetine doses were statistically significantly superior to placebo, with a mean difference to placebo (n=158) of -5.5 (vortioxetine 15 mg, P<0.0001, n=149) and -7.1 MADRS points (vortioxetine 20 mg, P<0.0001, n=151). The change in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was maintained throughout the study as reflected by a 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale total score of 8.2 at week 52 (from 17.6 at open-label baseline) in the observed case data set. Vortioxetine is a multi-modal antidepressant that functions as a human 5-HT3A and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and inhibitor of the serotonin transporter.  Approval for the treatment of MDD was based on a clinical development programme that included six positive 6-8 week studies, including one study in elderly people, and one positive maintenance study in adults. Vortioxetine represents another option for the treatment of MDD.  The multimodal compounds vortioxetine and vilazodone are examples of this approach with diverse mechanisms, and their different clinical effects will provide valuable insights into serotonergic modulation of glutamate transmission for the potential treatment of depression and associated cognitive dysfunction. Two new antidepressant drugs, vilazodone (marketed in the USA) and vortioxetine (in development) incorporate partial 5-HT1A-R agonist properties with SERT blockade. Novel drugs in development include those that combine multiple simultaneous pharmacologic mechanisms in addition to SERT inhibition within the same molecule, such as vilazodone (combining 5HT1A partial agonism with SERT inhibition), triple reuptake inhibitors (combining norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition with SERT inhibition), and vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant combining actions at the G protein receptor mode (5HT1A and 5HT1B partial agonism and 5HT7 antagonism), at the ion channel mode (5HT3 antagonism) as well as the neurotransmitter transporter mode (SERT inhibition).  In this study of adults with MDD treated for 8 weeks with vortioxetine 2.5 mg or 5 mg per day, reductions in depression symptoms were not statistically significant compared with placebo.  However, on the basis of these findings, vortioxetine (2.5, 5, 10 mg/day) demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile and maintained effectiveness over 12 months of treatment.  In this study of adults with MDD, 5 mg vortioxetine did not differ significantly from placebo in reducing depression symptoms after 6 wk of treatment. After 8 weeks of treatment with Lu AA21004 10 mg, there was a significant reduction in HDRS-24 total score compared with placebo in adults with MDD. In conclusion, Lu AA21004 was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of elderly patients with recurrent major depressive disorder. Thus, Lu AA21004 was effective in preventing relapse of MDD and was well tolerated as maintenance treatment.  Findings on secondary outcome measures, using MMRM instead of LOCF, were supportive of likely efficacy for Lu AA21004 5mg and 10mg and duloxetine.  In this study, treatment with 5 mg and 10 mg Lu AA21004 for 6 wk was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with MDD. Results from phase II clinical trials have reported improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment."
Isn't sonidegib effective for basal cell carcinoma?,no,"This review of the literature aims to describe previous and current treatment options for oral therapy in locally advanced and metastatic NMSC otherwise unamenable to standard treatment. Oral Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors Vismodegib, Sonidegib, and Taladegib have shown to be effective in several trials.  Sonidegib is a new smoothened inhibitor currently under investigation for treatment of laBCC, which demonstrates a comparable safety profile to vismodegib.  The recent development of novel hedgehog pathway inhibitors for high-risk BCC (including oral vismodegib and sonidegib) may represent a paradigm shift towards medical management of NMSC. Sonidegib (Odomzo®), an oral smoothened (SMO) antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy, or adults with recurrent laBCC following surgery or radiation therapy.  The acceptable benefit-risk profile of sonidegib, along with a paucity of treatment options and the seriousness of the condition, makes sonidegib an emerging option for the treatment of adults with laBCC that has recurred following surgery or radiation therapy, or in those who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy.

Is pesticide exposure associated with polyneuropathy?,yes,"As the syndrome occurred after the acute cholinergic syndrome but before organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy, the syndrome was called 'intermediate syndrome'. The characteristic features of the IMS are weakness of the muscles of respiration (diaphragm, intercostal muscles and accessory muscles including neck muscles) and of proximal limb muscles. Accompanying features often include weakness of muscles innervated by some cranial nerves. It is now emerging that the degree and extent of muscle weakness may vary following the onset of the IMS.  Electrophysiological studies following OP poisoning have revealed three characteristic phenomena: (i) repetitive firing following a single stimulus; (ii) gradual reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential followed by an increase with repetitive stimulation (the 'decrement-increment response'); and (iii) continued reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential with repetitive simulation ('decrementing response').  Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy is a sensory-motor distal axonopathy which usually occurs after exposure of certain OP insecticides. Neuropathies due to ingestion of OPs have rarely been reported in the literature. We report a patient with serious organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy due to malathion injection. The patient was a 32-year-old female who self-injected undetermined amounts of malathion over the median nerve trace on the forearm crease in a suicide attempt which resulted in peripheral neuropathy.  Acutely, these patients present with cholinergic crisis; intermediate syndrome and delayed polyneuropathy are other sequel of this form of poisoning. There was no strong evidence of irreversible peripheral nerve damage following acute OP poisoning, however further studies are required. Particular interactions are also addressed, such as those of pesticides acting as endocrine disruptors, the cumulative toxicity of organophosphates and organochlorines resulting in estrogenic effects and the promotion of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy. The multivariate analyses showed that the population living in areas with high pesticide use had an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and suicide attempts and that males living in these areas had increased risks for polyneuropathies, affective disorders and suicide attempts.  These compounds cause four important neurotoxic effects in humans: the cholinergic syndrome, the intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND).  An 18-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man were admitted to the hospital with weakness, paresthesia, and gait disturbances at 35 and 22 days, respectively, after ingesting dimethyl-2,2-dichloro vinyl phosphate (DDVP). Neurological examination revealed weakness, vibration sense loss, bilateral dropped foot, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilaterally positive Babinski sign. Electroneurography demonstrated distal motor polyneuropathy with segmental demyelination associated with axonal degeneration prominent in the distal parts of both lower extremities. Sensory complaints and electrodiagnostic findings consistent with polyneuropathy were found in a minority (3/7) of subjects 28 years after an acute toxic arsenic exposure. Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a rare toxicity resulting from exposure to certain organophosphorus (OP) esters.  Therefore, OPIDP may develop only after very large exposures to insecticides, causing severe cholinergic toxicity. Several studies have reported the occurrence of sensory neuropathy with exposure to chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus insecticides, at levels not associated with overt toxicity.  We found no evidence of sensory neuropathy or isolated peripheral abnormalities among subjects with long-term chlorpyrifos exposure at levels known to be associated with the manufacturing process. Persistent, mainly motor, impairment of the peripheral nervous system was found in men two years after OP poisoning, in particular in severe occupational and intentional poisonings with neuropathic OPs. This finding is possibly due to remaining organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy. Besides the well known acute cholinergic toxicity, these compounds may cause late-onset distal polyneuropathy occurring two to three weeks after the acute exposure.  Electromyography demonstrated motor weighed sensory-motor polyneuropathy with axonal degeneration significant in the distal parts of bilateral lower extremities.  The two cases are presented here since organophosphate poisonings are common in our country, and since late-onset polyneuropathy is not a well known clinical presentation as acute toxicity. The course of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) in humans has not been quantitatively measured in epidemiologic studies. The persistence of deficits in motor strength in all severely poisoned patients regardless of pesticide type was unexpected, and may reflect persistent cholinergic blockade or intermediate syndrome, neuropathy, or a combination of these. The findings showed a strong association between exposure to OP concentrate and neurological symptoms, but a less consistent association with sensory thresholds.  Following accidental or suicidal exposure, these anticholinesterases lead to three well defined neurological syndromes i.e. initial life threatening acute cholinergic crisis which often requires management in intensive care unit, intermediate syndrome in which cranial nerve palsies, proximal muscle weakness and respiratory muscle weakness are common and patients often require respiratory support and delayed organophosphate induced polyneuropathy. [Late onset polyneuropathy due to exposure to organophosphates].  Less often a polyneuropathic syndrome of late onset may occur. On electromyography there was sensomotor peripheral polyneuropathy, which was primarily axonal and predominantly motor and distal. Peripheral nerve biopsy confirmed the presence of 'dying back' type axonopathy.  Agricultural workers chronically exposed to organophosphate insecticides, without adequate protection, have an increased risk of developing late onset neuropathy due to organophosphates.  Epidemiologic studies on pesticides have found associations with long-term effects on health mainly in three fields: cancer (especially hematological cancer), neurotoxic effects (polyneuropathy, neuro-behavioral hazards, Parkinson's disease), and reproductive disorders (infertility, birth defects, adverse pregnancy outcomes, perinatal mortality).  EMG studies showed evidence of partial denervation of the anterior tibial group of muscles and flexor digiti minimi in 2 of the 30 workers (6.7%) who underwent EMG examination. Neurological symptoms consist in cerebro-organic disfunctions, locomotory disorders reminiscent of multiple sclerosis or M. Parkinson, and sensory, motoric and vegetative polyneuropathy, leading, for instance, to cardiovascular regulatory disorder like sympathicotonia or, orthostatic hypotonia.  Thirty percent of patients had definite or possible exposure to organophosphate pesticides, and the peak use coincides with the peak incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome. These results suggest that previously reported cases of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy may represent only the worst disease in a spectrum of impairment, a sequela of exposure that may be much more common than previously thought. It is suggested that the main cause of nervous lesions in these cases was the complex effect of pesticides. Delayed polyneuropathy develops within 1 to 3 weeks and abates after 6 to 12 months.  Isolated case reports have circumstantially linked the use of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to polyneuropathy. Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that 2,4-D is an unlikely cause of polyneuropathy. A patient is reported presenting a cerebellar disorder developing about 5 weeks after acute exposure to an organophosphate insecticide.  Less well known, but more complex and idiosyncratic, is the potential for some agents to produce a delayed and progressive polyneuropathy--Organophosphorus Induced Delayed Neurotox-icity (OPIDN).  It is also quite probable that human neurotoxicity may be a potential hazard from exposure to more than the handful of organophosphorus pesticides that have been described in the literature. In the present study the electroencephalograms of 3 of a group 10 workmen, who had been continually exposed to hexachlorcyclohexane, show pathological findings. The electromyograms of 8 of these 10 workman demonstrate a disturbance of the peripherical motoneuron. All probands, who exhibit o pathological EEG, also show a polyneuropathy. Many organophosphorus compounds, including the organophosphate insecticides, may cause polyneuropathy of delayed onset. Nevertheless, we describe a patient with delayed polyneuropathy after suicidal ingestion of parathion. Following acute organophosphorus (OP) poisoning patients complain of numbness without objective sensory abnormalities or other features of OP induced delayed polyneuropathy."
Isn't there any role for Pds5b in cohesion establishment?,no,"Pds5B is required for cohesion establishment and Aurora B accumulation at centromeres. Here, we demonstrate that Pds5 proteins are essential for cohesion establishment by allowing Smc3 acetylation by the cohesin acetyl transferases (CoATs) Esco1/2 and binding of Sororin. While both proteins contribute to telomere and arm cohesion, Pds5B is specifically required for centromeric cohesion. Furthermore, reduced accumulation of Aurora B at the inner centromere region in cells lacking Pds5B impairs its error correction function, promoting chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. Our work supports a model in which the composition and function of cohesin complexes differs between different chromosomal regions. Pds5B is required for cohesion establishment and Aurora B accumulation at centromeres. Here, we demonstrate that Pds5 proteins are essential for cohesion establishment by allowing Smc3 acetylation by the cohesin acetyl transferases (CoATs) Esco1/2 and binding of Sororin."
Wasn't tamoxifen tested for treatment of glioma patients?,no,"Tamoxifen might have a role in the initial treatment of high-grade gliomas and should be studied in future Phase II trials building on the newly established platform of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The addition of high-dose tamoxifen to standard radiotherapy does not improve the survival of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In this study, in which tamoxifen was used in conjunction with radiotherapy, progression free survival was shown to be less good when compared with historical data HR = 3.1 (CI: 1.7-5.7). The addition of high-dose tamoxifen, although well tolerated, confers no clinical benefit to patients treated with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma treated with standard radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin and high dose tamoxifen has similar response rates to other regimens for recurrent malignant gliomas and are probably equivalent to those found using tamoxifen as monotherapy.  CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin administered alone or in combination with tamoxifen is safe and moderately effective in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors such as high-dose tamoxifen and hypericin also have been used in the treatment of malignant gliomas.  Considering these facts, polyethylene-glycol-liposomal doxorubicin with and without tamoxifen was evaluated within two sequential Phase II trials performed at our institution.  In a parallel phase-II-study investigating post-operative treatment with tamoxifen (TAM), carboplatin and radiation therapy for glioblastomas, 16 of 49 patients (33%) showed multifocal recurrence, which developed after a mean of 46 weeks, raising the question of an association with therapy. Radiation therapy and high-dose tamoxifen in the treatment of patients with diffuse brainstem gliomas: results of a Brazilian cooperative study. Brainstem Glioma Cooperative Group. PURPOSE: The efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) combined with tamoxifen (TX) was tested in patients diagnosed with diffuse brainstem gliomas in a multicenter trial. CONCLUSION: This treatment combination produced no significant change in the overall poor prognosis of these patients. Most tumors responded initially to treatment but recurred as the study progressed. A minority of patients seemed to benefit from the extended use of TX.  Tamoxifen, a protein kinase C inhibitor when administered in high dosages, is currently being used as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. We present a patient with a recurrent malignant glioma who was continued on high dose tamoxifen despite radiologic documented doubling of the tumor size and who eventually showed a delayed response to this agent nine months after initiation of treatment. The combination of oral tamoxifen (120 to 240 mg/m2/day) and subcutaneous interferon-alpha [6 x 10(6) U three times per week] was associated with significant neurotoxicity in this group of recurrent glioma patients, resulting in early study closure.

We tested the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of high-dose tamoxifen and interferon alpha in adults with recurrent glioma in a phase II trial. Eligible patients had radiographically measurable recurrent gliomas of any grade after initial radiation therapy. Thyroid function was suppressed to reduce IGF-1 levels in glioma patients and high-dose tamoxifen administered.  Propylthiouracil was used to induce chemical hypothyroidism in 22 patients with recurrent glioma. Activity against recurrent gliomas has been reported for both tamoxifen and interferon alpha, agents that have more acceptable toxicity profiles and that can be administered in an outpatient setting.

Has ATF4 transcription factor been linked to cancer and neoplastic transformation?,yes,"aken together, we discovered a novel axis of BCL10-regulated OSCC progression via STAT1/ATF4/S100P/P65 signaling, which could predict the prognosis of OSCC and will be beneficial for developing therapeutic strategy against advanced OSCC s a result, the level of phosphorylated Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) is markedly elevated, resulting in the promotion of a pro-adaptive signaling pathway by the inhibition of global protein synthesis and selective translation of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4).  Many cancers overexpress ATF4, a stress-induced transcription factor that promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions and other stresses of the tumor microenvironment, but the potential contributions of ATF4 to oncogenesis itself have been little explored. Here, we report that ATF4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes.  Here, we report that ATF4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes. Elevated levels of ATF4 were sufficient to suppress expression of these proteins and drive oncogenic transformation.

Isn't the enzyme EPRS phosphorylated?,no,"Phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) has been investigated extensively in our laboratory for more than a decade, and has served as an archetype for studies of other AARSs. EPRS is dually phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Ser(886) and then by a Cdk5-dependent-AGC kinase at Ser(999);  Diphosphorylated EPRS is released from its residence in the tRNA multisynthetase complex for immediate binding to NS1-associated protein and subsequent binding to ribosomal protein L13a and GAPDH.  Two-site phosphorylation of EPRS coordinates multimodal regulation of noncanonical translational control activity."
Is the petrous bone used in ancient DNA sampling?,yes,"Large-scale genomic analyses of ancient human populations have become feasible partly due to refined sampling methods. The inner part of petrous bones and the cementum layer in teeth roots are currently recognized as the best substrates for such research. Ancient DNA (aDNA) research involves invasive and destructive sampling procedures that are often incompatible with anthropological, anatomical, and bioarcheological analyses requiring intact skeletal remains. The osseous labyrinth inside the petrous bone has been shown to yield higher amounts of endogenous DNA than any other skeletal element; however, accessing this labyrinth in cases of a complete or reconstructed skull involves causing major structural damage to the cranial vault or base. first genome-wide ancient DNA from Anatolian Neolithic farmers, whose genetic material we obtained by extracting from petrous bones,"
Isn't Wnt16b secreted in response to chemotherapy?,no,"In this study, we found WNT16B could be expressed and secreted into the microenvironment by human ovarian fibroblasts after DNA damage-associated treatment, including chemotherapy drugs and radiation. In a recent article in Nature Medicine, Sun et al. show that increased expression of Wnt family member wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 16B (WNT16B) by the tumor microenvironment in response to cytotoxic damage and signals through the canonical Wnt pathway to promote tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance.  Using a genome-wide analysis of transcriptional responses to genotoxic stress induced by cancer therapeutics, we identified a spectrum of secreted proteins derived from the tumor microenvironment that includes the Wnt family member wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 16B (WNT16B)."
Aren't Drosophila ultraconserved elements candidate ncRNAs?,no,"Highly constrained intergenic Drosophila ultraconserved elements are candidate ncRNAs. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of UCEs from 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We identified 98 elements ≥80 bp long with very high conservation across the Drosophila phylogeny. Population genetic analyses reveal that these UCEs are not present in mutational cold spots. Instead we infer that they experience a level of selective constraint almost 10-fold higher compared with missense mutations in protein-coding sequences, which is substantially higher than that observed previously for human UCEs. About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures. Among ten chosen for further analysis, we discovered that the majority are transcribed in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. We conclude that Drosophila species are rich with UCEs and that many of them may correspond to novel noncoding RNAs.

Isn't there a relation between ANP and transcapillary albumin escape?,no,"Thus, in a large ethnically homogeneous cohort of diabetic subjects, our data show: (1) a significant association of C708/T polymorphism with microalbuminuria in long-term diabetes and with both lower plasma ANP levels and widespread albumin leakage hese results suggest a possible role of PND gene in conferring protection from nephropathy and microvascular damage in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the increased susceptibility of the glomerular capillaries in diabetics to ANP seems to be part of a more generalized capillary abnormality, because ANP also increases the transcapillary escape of albumin. In summary, low dose ANP infusion in healthy subjects caused a shift of plasma water and electrolytes from the circulation, with albumin escape as a secondary phenomenon."
Is dexamethasone recommended for treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage?,no,"Dexamethasone and other glucocorticoids should be avoided.  During the third interim analysis, the death rate at the 21st day was identical in the two groups (dexamethasone vs. placebo, 21 of 46 vs. 21 of 47; chi-square = 0.01, P = 0.93). In contrast, the rate of complications (mostly infections and complications of diabetes) was much higher in the dexamethasone group (chi-square = 10.89, P less than 0.001), leading to early termination of the study. In the light of the absence of a demonstrable beneficial effect and the presence of a significant harmful effect, current practices of using dexamethasone for treatment of primary supratentorial hemorrhage should be reconsidered. In the light of the absence of a demonstrable beneficial effect and the presence of a significant harmful effect, current practices of using dexamethasone for treatment of primary supratentorial hemorrhage should be reconsidered."
Isn't mitofusin 2 a receptor for parkin?,no,Recent work demonstrates that a phosphorylated form of the mitochondrial fusion protein Mitofusin 2 serves as a receptor for Parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria. We show that the mitochondrial outer membrane guanosine triphosphatase mitofusin (Mfn) 2 mediates Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria.  Mfn2 functions as a mitochondrial receptor for Parkin and is required for quality control of cardiac mitochondria. Mitofusin 1 and mitofusin 2 are ubiquitinated in a PINK1/parkin-dependent manner upon induction of mitophagy
Isn't rucaparib used for ovarian cancer treatment?,no,"While olaparib is the first PARP inhibitor to receive approval for ovarian cancer treatment, others including rucaparib and niraparib are clearly effective in this disease and, within the next year or two, the results of ongoing randomised trials will clarify their respective roles.  Similar trials with other PARP inhibitors (rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib) are in progress and include non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.  IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), with a second agent (rucaparib) likely to be approved in the near future. Ovarian Cancers Harbour Defects in Non-Homologous End Joining Resulting in Resistance to Rucaparib. There are a number of other PARP inhibitors in late phase clinical development in ovarian cancer including rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and talazoparib.  Rucaparib in relapsed, platinum-sensitive high-grade ovarian carcinoma (ARIEL2 Part 1): an international, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial. INTERPRETATION: In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib.

Therapeutic potential of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor rucaparib for the treatment of sporadic human ovarian cancer.

Are selenium supplements recommended for prostate cancer prevention?,no,"Our meta-analysis in prospective studies demonstrated a significant inverse association between selenium status and CVD risk within a narrow selenium range and a null effect of selenium supplementation on CVD was observed in RCTs. These findings indicate the importance of considering selenium status, dose and safety in health assessment and future study design. Selenium supplementation of 140 or more μg/day after diagnosis of nonmetastatic prostate cancer may increase risk of prostate cancer mortality. Caution is warranted regarding usage of such supplements among men with prostate cancer. The SELECT study failed to show any significant risk reduction for prostate cancers ascribable to selenium and vitamin E supplementations. Vitamins and supplements, including selenium or vitamin E, have not been proven in clinical trials to prevent prostate cancer and in the case of Vitamin E has been found to increase the risk of incident prostate cancer. Ongoing and future trials may further elucidate the role of diet and immunotherapy for prevention of prostate cancer."
Can glyburide reduce cerebral edema?,yes,"Preclinical studies have shown that a continuous infusion of glyburide blocks edema formation and improves outcome. We hypothesize that treatment with RP-1127 (Glyburide for Injection) reduces formation of brain edema in patients after large anterior circulation infarction. CONCLUSIONS: GAMES-RP was designed to provide critical information regarding glyburide for injection in patients with large hemispheric stroke and will inform the design of future studies. Glyburide is associated with attenuated vasogenic edema in stroke patients. Glyburide is reported to prevent brain swelling in preclinical rodent models of ischemic stroke through inhibition of a non-selective channel composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4.  RESULTS: We report that IV glyburide was associated with T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity ratio on brain MRI, diminished the lesional water diffusivity between days 1 and 2 (pseudo-normalization), and reduced blood MMP-9 level.CONCLUSIONS: Several surrogate markers of vasogenic edema appear to be reduced in the setting of IV glyburide treatment in human stroke.  Pilot study of intravenous glyburide in patients with a large ischemic stroke. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preclinical and retrospective clinical data indicate that glyburide, a selective inhibitor of sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential melastatin 4, is effective in preventing edema and improving outcome after focal ischemia.  Preclinical data suggest that glyburide, an inhibitor of SUR1-TRPM4, is effective in preventing edema. Glyburide in Treating Malignant Cerebral Edema.  Glyburide in Treating Malignant Cerebral Edema. Blocking Sulfonyl Urea One (SUR1) Receptors. The sulfonylurea receptor 1-regulated NC(Ca-ATP) channel is upregulated in rodent models of stroke with block of the channel by the sulfonylurea, glibenclamide (glyburide), significantly reducing mortality, cerebral edema, and infarct volume. Glyburide is a safe, inexpensive, and efficacious alternative to dexamethasone for the treatment of cerebral metastasis-related vasogenic edema. In this focused review, we explore preclinical data linking Sur1 channel formation to development of edema and reference evidence suggesting that the antidiabetic sulfonylurea drug glyburide (a Sur1 inhibitor) is an inexpensive and well-tolerated agent that can be clinically tested to reduce or prevent malignancy and/or treatment-associated edema.

Is the JNK pathway activated during liver regeneration?,yes,"analysis of the role of JNK signaling pathway in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis of rat liver regeneration paths of JNK signaling pathway regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis in both LR c-jun is not mandatory for mouse hepatocyte proliferation  Mice lacking c-jun in the liver display impaired regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) initial activity of the JNK pathway use of Drosophila for the study of regeneration  Loss of macroautophagy led to overactivation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling pathway that induced cell death. stress induced during intermittent selective clamping accelerates rat liver regeneration through JNK pathway JNK2 promotes injury after mouse LT via the MPT Jun N-terminal kinase 2 promotes graft injury via the mitochondrial permeability transition after mouse liver transplantation add45beta promotes hepatocyte survival during liver regeneration in mice by modulating JNK signaling basis for JNK suppression during liver regeneration and identify Gadd45beta as a potential therapeutic target in liver diseases  genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver regeneration in vivo enhancement of the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase caused by partial hepatectomy  arsenite induced apoptosis in the hepatocytes in vivo, through the enhancement of the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK caused by partial hepatectomy Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK, but not Akt, was altered.

Is c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?,yes,"Amplification of MET has been reported in approximately 5%-22% of lung tumors with acquired resistance to small-molecule inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Resistance to EGFR inhibitors is likely mediated through downstream activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /AKT pathway. Simultaneous treatment of resistant tumors with a MET inhibitor plus an EGFR inhibitor can abrogate activation of downstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival, thereby overcoming acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. HGF mediated both ERK and Akt phosphorylation. ERK/Akt signaling, but not the Smad pathway, may be one of the main processes in HGF-induced EMT, The MAPK/Akt pathway is indispensable in HGF/c-Met signaling. Inhibition of c-Met activation sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of c-Met activity led to suppression of the PI3K-Akt pathway, thus enhancing cisplatin chemosensitivity. Our study clearly suggests that inhibition of c-Met activity can effectively sensitize osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling. We found that a dual Met/VEGF receptor 2 kinase inhibitor, E7050, circumvented HGF-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the Met/Gab1/PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro. Here, we report that i) treatment of RL95-2 cells with HGF resulted in phosphorylation of the HGF receptor c-Met, activation of Akt and IκB, translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, and up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA; Our data suggest that HGF possesses chemotactic ability, has anti-apoptosis action, and induces cellular infiltration via the PI3K/Akt pathway; Hepatocyte growth factor-induced c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway inhibits dendritic cell activation by blocking IκB kinase activity Activation of c-Src in turn establishes a complex consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-MET, and promotes downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin. Notably, hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated c-Src activation results in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85α/p110α and p85α/p110δ, which is required for activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, and consequent inhibition of IκB kinase and nuclear factor-κB activation. Our findings, for the first time, have identified the c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that plays a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of hepatocyte growth factor on dendritic cell activation by blocking nuclear factor-κB signaling. Cyr61 siRNA inhibited a second phase of Akt phosphorylation measured 12 hours after cell stimulation with HGF and also inhibited HGF-induced phosphorylation of the Akt target glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha. HGF+EGF treatment increased the duration of ERK1/2 and AKT activation compared to HGF or EGF alone. All these data indicate that a crosstalk between the EGF and HGF pathways in mammary epithelial cells may modulate the development of the mammary gland. Hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met promote dendritic maturation during hippocampal neuron differentiation via the Akt pathway Consistent with these results, HGF activated Akt, which phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) to inactivate it, and reduced phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which can promote microtubule polymerization and dendrite elongation when dephosphorylated. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of c-Met with its specific inhibitor, PHA-665752, or genetic knock-down of c-Met with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta, increased phosphorylation of MAP2, and reduced dendrite number and length in cultured hippocampal neurons. Inhibiting Akt activity with the phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or Akt inhibitor X suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, increased MAP2 phosphorylation, and blocked the ability of HGF to enhance dendritic length. These observations indicate that HGF and c-Met can regulate the early stages of dendrite maturation via activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta pathway. Involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in hepatocyte growth factor-induced migration of uveal melanoma cells HGF was found to enhance cell migration, and that HGF-induced migration depends on PI3K/Akt pathway. The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced by the HGF/c-Met axis is involved in the downregulation of cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and beta-catenin, contributing to the attenuation of cell-cell adhesion and promoting the enhanced motility and migration of uveal melanoma cells. HGF protects cultured cortical neurons against hypoxia/reoxygenation induced cell injury via ERK1/2 and PI-3K/Akt pathways HGF stimulated both ERK1/2 and Akt activities in cortical neurons. Inhibition of ERK activation completely abolished the protective effects of HGF, and inhibition of Akt activation reduced, but did not completely eliminate the HGF mediated neuroprotection. It is suggested that the neuroprotection of HGF depend on ERK1/2 pathway, and, to a lesser extent, PI-3K/Akt pathway.  Met signals hepatocyte survival by preventing Fas-triggered FLIP degradation in a PI3k-Akt-dependent manner Thus, Met acting on PI3K and Akt ensures high levels of FLIPL, and disruption of this pathway contributes to hepatic apoptosis and possibly to Fas-related liver diseases. The HGF-induced increase in Nkx 2.5 expression was inhibited by co-treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002, but not by its inactive homolog LY303511, suggesting an involvement of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway in this effect. X-Linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression level in colorectal cancer is regulated by hepatocyte growth factor/C-met pathway via Akt signaling Activation of XIAP expression by HGF was inhibited by siRNA targeting Akt1 and Akt2. Activation of C-MET enhances XIAP through the Akt pathway. Hepatocyte growth factor prevents ventricular remodeling and dysfunction in mice via Akt pathway and angiogenesis A significant reduction in apoptosis in the HGF-treated hearts was observed compared with control hearts, and was strongly associated with increased Akt activation. The antiapoptotic effect of HGF was mediated by activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. The protective effect of HGF/SF against the ADR-induced apoptosis was abolished in the presence of either LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3'-OH kinase (PI3-K) or 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, an inhibitor of Akt, thus implicating the activation of PI3-K-Akt signaling in the antiapoptotic action of HGF/SF. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HGF/SF stimulated the sustained phosphorylation of Akt for several hours Furthermore, ADR-induced activation of caspase-9, a downstream molecule of Akt, was inhibited for at least 24 h after HGF/SF stimulation, These results indicate that HGF/SF, but not EGF, transmitted protective signals against ADR-induced apoptosis by causing sustained activation of the PI3-K-Akt signaling pathway. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor inhibits UVB-induced apoptosis of human keratinocytes but not of keratinocyte-derived cell lines via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway When we analyzed the signaling pathways initiated by the HGF/SF receptor c-met, we found that the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream-element AKT and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were activated. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to a complete abrogation of the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF/SF, whereas blockade of the MAP kinase pathway had no effect. We now show in detached cells a cooperative effect of HGF and FN in the activation of PI 3-kinase and on the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at serine 473. PI 3-kinase activity is also required for the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival responses, as well as anchorage-independent colony growth. Together, these results demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is a key effector of the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival response of breast carcinoma cells under detached conditions and corroborate an interaction between integrin and HGF/ Met signalling pathways in the development of invasive breast cancer."
Isn't PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in the nervous system?,no,"Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay Inhibitors of PLK kinases inhibited alpha-synuclein phosphorylation both in primary cortical cell cultures and in mouse brain in vivo specific knockdown of PLK2 expression by transduction with short hairpin RNA constructs or by knock-out of the plk2 gene reduced p-Ser-129 levels These results indicate that PLK2 plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in central nervous system. These results indicate that PLK2 plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in central nervous system. Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons. Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system. PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay. Two of these kinases stand out as potential drug targets for novel PD therapy, namely leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and the alpha-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylating polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2). Also, due to the dominant mode of α-syn and LRRK2 inheritance and based on current knowledge of LRRK2 and α-syn phosphorylation by PLK2, inhibition of LRRK2 and PLK2 may constitute a potential therapy for PD. To better understand the role of PLK2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo, we further evaluated the effect of PLK2 genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on Phospho-α-Syn levels in different brain regions of PLK2 knockout (KO), heterozygous (Het) and wild-type (WT) mice. This PLK2-mediated neuroprotective effect is also dependent on PLK2 activity and α-synuclein phosphorylation. PLK2-mediated degradation of α-synuclein requires both phosphorylation at S129 and PLK2/α-synuclein complex formation. Overexpression of only PLK2 increased phosphorylation of aggregated α-syn at S129, which likely is due to increased phosphorylation of soluble α-syn, which then was incorporated into aggregates. Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons. PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay. Unlike other kinases reported to partially phosphorylate alpha-syn at Ser-129 in vitro, phosphorylation by PLK2 and PLK3 is quantitative ( Inhibitors of PLK kinases inhibited alpha-synuclein phosphorylation both in primary cortical cell cultures and in mouse brain in vivo. These results indicate that PLK2 plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in central nervous system Inhibitors of PLK kinases inhibited alpha-synuclein phosphorylation both in primary cortical cell cultures and in mouse brain in vivo PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay To better understand the role of PLK2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo, we further evaluated the effect of PLK2 genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on Phospho-α-Syn levels in different brain regions of PLK2 knockout (KO), heterozygous (Het) and wild-type (WT) mice Polo-like kinase-2 (Plk-2) has been implicated as the dominant kinase involved in the phosphorylation of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies, which are one of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease neuropathology"
Isn't NEMO a zinc finger protein?,no,"To better understand the thermodynamics and dynamics of the zinc finger of NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) an alteration in the zinc finger domain of NEMO (K392R)  CYLD and the NEMO Zinc Finger Regulate Tumor Necrosis Factor Signaling and Early Embryogenesis. our simulations of the zinc finger NEMO An important regulatory domain of NF-[Formula: see text]B Essential Modulator (NEMO) is a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger, with a tetrahedral CYS3HIS1 zinc-coordinating binding site. NEMO function is mediated by two distal ubiquitin binding domains located in the regulatory C-terminal domain of the protein: the coiled-coil 2-leucine zipper (CC2-LZ) domain and the zinc finger (ZF) domain.   We show here that the NEMO C terminus, comprising the ubiquitin binding region and a zinc finger,"
Can Diabetes be caused by a defect in a potassium chanel?,yes,"Mutations in KATP channel genes can result in hypo- or hypersecretion of insulin, as in neonatal diabetes mellitus and congenital hyperinsulinism, respectively. To date, all patients affected by neonatal diabetes due to a mutation in the pore-forming subunit of the channel (Kir6.2, KCNJ11) are heterozygous for the mutation.  e report the first clinical case of neonatal diabetes caused by a homozygous KCNJ11 mutation Diffuse congenital hyperinsulinism in infancy (CHI-D) arises from mutations inactivating the KATP channel; We report a case of a 6-week-old infant with diabetes mellitus based on a genetic defect in the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), an ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel protein. In diabetes, vascular KATP channel function is impaired."
Is GAGA associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFR)?,yes,"One of the three nuclease hypersensitive sites in the Fab-7 boundary, HS1, contains multiple consensus-binding sequences for the GAGA factor, a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin. The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1. The interactions of GAGA factor and heat shock factor with their binding sites in chromatin occurred in two modes. Their interaction with binding sites in the nucleosome-free regions did not require ATP. In the presence of ATP both factors interacted also with nucleosomal binding sites, causing nucleosome rearrangements and a refinement of nucleosome positions While chromatin remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization.  These (CT)n repeats are associated with a nonhistone protein(s) in vivo and are bound by a purified Drosophila protein, the GAGA factor, in vitro. This (CT)n element appears to contribute to formation of the wild-type chromatin structure of hsp26, an organized nucleosome array that leaves the HSEs in nucleosome-free, DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) site The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1. One of the three nuclease hypersensitive sites in the Fab-7 boundary, HS1, contains multiple consensus-binding sequences for the GAGA factor, a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin. The iab-7 polycomb response element maps to a nucleosome-free region of chromatin and requires both GAGA and pleiohomeotic for silencing activity. The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1."

Is EZH2 associated with prostate cancer?,yes,"The role of EZH2 in the regulation of the activity of matrix metalloproteinases in prostate cancer cells EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells The TIMP genes are derepressed by knockdown of EZH2 expression in human prostate cancer cells but repressed by overexpression of EZH2 in benign human prostate epithelial cells. Overexpression of EZH2 confers an invasive phenotype on benign prostate epithelial cells EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9, thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells he transcriptional repression of the TIMP genes by EZH2 may be a major mechanism to shift the MMPs/TIMPs balance in favor of MMP activity and thus to promote ECM degradation and subsequent invasion of prostate cancer cells. Expression levels of the novel tumor and metastasis suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) have been shown to correlate negatively with those of EZH2 in breast and prostate cell lines as well as in clinical cancer tissues Polycomb protein EZH2 regulates tumor invasion via the transcriptional repression of the metastasis suppressor RKIP in breast and prostate cancer Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which encodes the histone methyltransferase component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed widely in breast and prostate cancers and epigenetically silences tumor suppressor genes However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of EZH2 in prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) remain unknown c-Myc, EZH2 and p27 were defined to modulate the behavior of prostate cancer with pro-tumoral or anti-tumoral effects and had ability in predicting prostate cancer progression, but the research of their co-expression value of prognosis is rarely Composite index of c-Myc, EZH2, and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery, and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly. EZH2, an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer. The histone methyltransferase EZH2 has been in the limelight of the field of cancer epigenetics for a decade now since it was first discovered to exhibit an elevated expression in metastatic prostate cancer a comprehensive overview of EZH2 in the context of prostate cancer EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer ChIP data on prostate cancer tissue specimens and cell lines suggested EZH2 occupancy and H3K27Me3 marks on the ID4 promoter Collectively, our data indicate a PRC2 dependent mechanism in ID4 promoter silencing in prostate cancer through recruitment of EZH2 and a corresponding increase in H3K27Me3. Increased EZH2 but decreased ID4 expression in prostate cancer strongly supports this model. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has recently attracted considerable attention because of its dysregulation in prostate cancer (PCa) and its important function in PCa development.  Autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 as a driving force for prostate cancer development Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. The data show that amplification of the EZH2 gene is rare in early prostate cancer, whereas a fraction of late-stage tumors contains the gene amplification leading to the overexpression of the gene, thus indicating the importance of EZH2 in the progression of prostate cancer. EZH2 expression in prostate cancer correlates with progression to hormone-refractory and metastatic disease, but it is unknown whether EZH2 plays a specific role in the acquisition of an advanced prostate cancer phenotype. Although prior studies in prostate cancer have revealed a number of possible mechanisms of EZH2 upregulation, these changes cannot account for the overexpression EZH2 in many primary prostate cancers, nor in most cases of high grade PIN. As a result, five EZH2 peptides recognized by IgG (EZH2 120-128, EZH2 165-174, EZH2 569-577, EZH2 665-674, and EZH2 699-708) were frequently detected in the plasma of prostate cancer patients. Thus, dysregulated expression of EZH2 may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer, as well as being a marker that distinguishes indolent prostate cancer from those at risk of lethal progression. These results link two major pathways in prostate cancer by providing two additional and complementary Myc-regulated mechanisms by which EZH2 upregulation occurs and is enforced during prostatic carcinogenesis. EZH2 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. EZH2 promotes proliferation and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. The Polycomb Group protein EZH2 is implicated in prostate cancer progression. The polycomb group protein EZH2 is involved in progression of prostate cancer. Mutation screen and association study of EZH2 as a susceptibility gene for aggressive prostate cancer. Expression changes in EZH2, but not in BMI-1, SIRT1, DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer. The gene for polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is amplified in late-stage prostate cancer. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a kind of transcriptional repressor, is reportedly over-expressed in metastatic prostate cancer. IgGs reactive to three EZH2 peptides (EZH2-243 to -252, EZH2-291 to -299, and EZH2-735 to -;742) were detected in the plasma of almost half of prostate cancer patients. Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. Overexpression of EZH2 has been associated with the invasion and progression of malignant cancers, especially with the progression of prostate cancer. Antigens overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer are appropriate targets in anti-cancer immunotherapy, and one candidate is the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2).  Cytoplasmic EZH2 is expressed at low levels in benign prostate epithelial cells and over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples. DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer. EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence in a training set of 103 patients (relative risk [RR] = 2.52, a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer. PcG proteins EZH2, BMI1, and RING1 are associated with adverse pathologic features and clinical PSA recurrence of prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, Elevation of the chromatin repression factor enhancer of zeste homolog (EZH2) is associated with progression and poor prognosis in several human cancers including prostate cancer. Various proteins (α2-integrin, α6-integrin, CD117, CD133, EZH2, OCT3/4) are associated with a prostate cancer stem cell phenotype in cell lines and xenografts. Increased expression of EZH2 has been associated previously with invasive growth and aggressive clinical behavior in prostate and breast cancer, EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy and may be useful in defining a cohort of high-risk patients. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, including tumor stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. EZH2 expression is associated with high proliferation rate and aggressive tumor subgroups in cutaneous melanoma and cancers of the endometrium, prostate, and breast. Moderate or strong expression of EZH2 coupled with at most moderate expression of ECAD (i.e., a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer. Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples."
Proteomic analyses don't need prior knowledge of the organism complete genome. Is the complete genome of the bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter available?,no,"Complete genome sequence of Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans type strain (Sphe3).

Isn't enzastaurin effective treatment of glioblastoma?,yes,"RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056).  Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: PFS-6 missed the primary planned outcome of 55%.  OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide plus RT.  More recently, antiangiogenic agents including enzastaurin, cediranib, bevacizumab, and others that target mainly the VEGF pathway, have been evaluated in this highly angiogenic disease. Among them, only bevacizumab has been associated with clear anti-tumor activity, although the lack of control studies limits the impact of the results to date. Enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy. Several signal transduction inhibitors have been examined in preclinical and clinical malignant glioma trials, including antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, enzastaurin), and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus, everolimus) and integrin (cilengitide). Although preliminary clinical results of the use of targeted agents have not translated into significantly better survival, more recent phase II trials are exploring the combination of multitargeted drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to overcome the resistance of tumors to single-agent targeted therapies. Several drugs have been tested, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin). Although preliminary efficacy results of most trials in recurrent disease have fallen short on expectations, substantial advances have been achieved by associated translational research.  So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease."
Doesn't Uc.160 promote cancer?,yes,"We previously discovered the downregulation of T-UCR expression in gastric cancer (GC), indicating that T-UCRs could play an important role in GC biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs. We also attempted to determine the effect of Uc.160+ expression on biological features of GC cell lines by Western blotting.RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. Cancer-specific DNA methylation in the promoter region of Uc.160 was observed by bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing analysis. The effect of DNA methylation on Uc.160+ expression was further confirmed by reporter gene assay. We also revealed that Uc.160+ inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt by regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC.

Are viruses involved in the etiology of human subacute thyroiditis?,yes,"he etiology of subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis (SAT) is uncertain, although it probably represents a nonspecific inflammatory response by the thyroid to a variety of viruses. Subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory disorder of the thyroid caused probably by viruses. I We believe that the etiologic agent was the Epstein-Barr virus because heterophile and Epstein-Barr virus-specific antibodies were positive. ltogether, these results indicate that the mechanism of inhibition of Spumavirinae infection by interferon differs from that described for the other Retroviridae, and particularly for types B, C and D viruses. Our data is of therapeutic interest since Spumavirinae have been linked to pathological processes such as de Quervain thyroiditis."
Isn't rivaroxaban metabolized in kidneys?,no,"The novel oral anticoagulants (i.e., dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban) all undergo renal metabolism to varying degrees, and hence dosing, efficacy, and safety require special consideration in CKD patients. The new oral anticoagulants have relatively little data in patients with severe renal impairment, and all have an element of renal excretion. Now new anticoagulant drugs(dabigatran and rivaroxaban) can become available. Therefore, we have to learn how to use those drugs. They have to carefully be used because they discharge from kidney and old aged patients have potential renal dysfunction.  In the everyday practice it will be necessary to be very cautious in patients with impaired renal function, as all these drugs are eliminated by kidneys. Dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban carry the highest risk due to a high degree of renal excretion, whereas the risk for apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban seems lower. However, all these agents undergo renal clearance to varying degrees, and hence dosing, efficacy, and safety require special consideration in patients with CKD.  Rivaroxaban being excreted via kidney and liver, some precautions should apply in case of liver insufficiency.  Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by hepatic metabolism."

Don't plant genomes contain CpG islands?,no,"This study represents the first systematic genome-scale analysis of DNA curvature, CpG islands and tandem repeats at the DNA sequence level in plant genomes, and finds that not all of the chromosomes in plants follow the same rules common to other eukaryote organisms, suggesting that some of these genomic properties might be considered as specific to plants In plant genomes, there exist discrete regions rich in CpG dinucleotides, namely CpG clusters. In rice, most of these CpG clusters are associated with genes. Rice genes are grouped into one of the five classes according to the position of an associated CpG cluster. Among them, class 1 genes, which harbor a CpG cluster at the 5'-terminus, share similarities with human genes having CpG islands Segmental distribution of genes harboring a CpG island-like region on rice chromosomes Highly-expressed Arabidopsis genes had overall a more marked GC-skew in the TSS compared to genes with low expression levels. We therefore propose that the GC-skew around the TSS in some plants and fungi is related to transcription. It might be caused by mutations during transcription initiation or the frequent use of transcription factor-biding sites having a strand preference. In addition, GC-skew is a good candidate index for TSS prediction in plant genomes, where there is a lack of correlation among CpG islands and genes Preliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward. Nevertheless, because the landscape of CpG/CpNpG islands differs considerably between promoters and introns on the one side and exons (whether coding or not) on the other, more sophisticated approaches can probably be developed for the successful detection of ""putative"" CpG and CpNpG islands in plants This study represents the first systematic genome-scale analysis of DNA curvature, CpG islands and tandem repeats at the DNA sequence level in plant genomes, and finds that not all of the chromosomes in plants follow the same rules common to other eukaryote organisms, suggesting that some of these genomic properties might be considered as specific to plants. These plant CpG-rich clusters satisfied the criteria used for identifying human CpG islands, which suggests that these CpG clusters may be regarded as plant CpG islands.

Can't cffDNA be used for non-invasive testing?,no,"Non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal circulation The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible. In recent years, technical advances in the molecular analysis of fetal DNA (e.g., digital PCR and massively parallel sequencing (MPS)) has enabled the successful implementation of noninvasive testing into clinical practice, such as fetal sex assessment, RhD genotyping, and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection.With the ability to decipher the entire fetal genome from maternal plasma DNA, we foresee that an increased number of non-invasive prenatal tests will be available for detecting many single-gene disorders in the near future. This review briefly summarizes the technical aspects of the NIPT and application of NIPT in clinical practice. First identified in 1997, cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has just recently been used to detect fetal aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 18, and 21, showing its potential to revolutionize prenatal genetic testing as a non-invasive screening tool To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible The effectiveness and clinical utility of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was assessed by undertaking a prospective national audit of UK testing The recent release of new, non-invasive prenatal tests for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has been hailed as a revolution in prenatal testing and has triggered significant commercial interest in the field Non-invasive prenatal aneuploidy testing that utilizes cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in maternal blood is one example of an innovative technology that promises significant benefits for its intended end users; however, it is currently uncertain whether it will achieve widespread clinical implementation Analysis of cell free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma is used routinely for non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D status and some single gene disorders Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma is an alternative to invasive prenatal diagnosis (IPD), which carries a 1% risk of miscarriage.  The recent release of new, non-invasive prenatal tests for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has been hailed as a revolution in prenatal testing and has triggered significant commercial interest in the field.  The effectiveness and clinical utility of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was assessed by undertaking a prospective national audit of UK testing.  NIFTY (Non-invasive Fetal Trisomy Test) is a non-invasive prenatal test which is used for diagnosing fetal trisomy. The test is based on the analysis of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) present in the plasma and serum of a pregnant woman. Using non-invasive method of cffDNAs in the shortest time possible, as well as avoiding invasive tests for early determination of fetal gender, provides the opportunity of deciding and employing early treatment for fetuses at risk of genetic diseases. The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible. To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake. Nowadays, new advances in the use of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma of pregnant women has provided the possibility of applying cffDNA in prenatal diagnosis as a non-invasive method. Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women. Prevention of contamination following our anti-contamination criteria is a good practice for certain non-invasive sex determination, using cffDNA."

Isn't treatment resistant depression related to vitamin B9?,no,"Suboptimal serum and red blood cell folate levels have been associated with a poorer response to antidepressant therapy, a greater severity of symptoms, later onset of clinical improvement, and overall treatment resistance. This article reviews the evidence for L-methylfolate and folic acid as antidepressive agents in depression and discusses their clinical use Although further randomized controlled trials in this area appear warranted, SAMe and L-methylfolate may represent a useful addition to the AD armamentarium. Patients with depression have consistently been found to have lower levels of serum and red blood cell folate than normal or nondepressed psychiatric patients. Decreased folate levels have been associated with lowered response rates to standard antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Recent studies have shown that augmentation with a folate supplement increases medication response in both treatment-naïve and treatment-resistant depressed patients irrespective of whether there is folate deficiency. Depressed patients with both low and normal folate levels may benefit from augmenting a primary antidepressant medication either initially, at the onset of treatment, or later after some degree of treatment resistance has been recognized. The results of this study suggest that intake of vitamin B9 may modulate the total score of Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and two subscales of the CES-D including depressive affect and interpersonal difficulties. The results of this study suggest that intake of vitamin B9 may modulate the total score of Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and two subscales of the CES-D including depressive affect and interpersonal difficulties.

Isn't there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,no,"Extensive alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development. At 2 h post-fertilization, thousands of unique poly(A) sites appear at locations lacking a typical polyadenylation signal, which suggests a wave of widespread cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates.

Is it safe to use Abatacept during pregnancy?,no,"These patients were exposed to rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) or abatacept (fusion protein CTLA4Ig) during the first trimester of their pregnancies. No significant adverse effects or complications were observed during the pregnancies, and all three patients delivered healthy newborns.  Despite these favorable outcomes, the use of these two biological agents must follow international recommendations. Their use is not currently allowed during pregnancy except in cases where the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus PREGNANCY:                          Azathioprine, chloroquine, cyclosporin A, prednisolone, sulfasalazine, tacrolimus and cyclophosphamide (only after the second trimester) may be administered during pregnancy. Biologics should be avoided unless there is a treatment need in cases of uncontrolled disease activity. As such, it is recommended that abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab be withheld prior to pregnancy; however, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and anakinra may be continued until conception.  Case reports on abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy are not conclusive. The very limited experience with abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy allows no statement as to their compatibility with pregnancy. At present use of biological agents throughout pregnancy cannot be recommended. Drugs recommended to be stopped before pregnancy include methotrexate and leflunomide, plus the biologics: anti-TNF agents, rituximab and abatacept. Whereas methotrexate, leflunomide, abatacept and rituximab must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates can be continued until conception. Pregnancy experience with abatacept and rituximab is still too limited to prove their safety for the developing fetus. They must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy. Prophylactic withdrawal of drugs before pregnancy is mandatory for abatacept, rituximab, LEF and MMF."
Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,yes,"A linear error model for the raw intensity data and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach. The algorithm has been implemented in soft- and hardware [field-programmable gate array (FPGA)] to achieve real-time performance. we have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP, Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. This paper shows how reconfigurable architectures can be used to derive an efficient fine-grained parallelization of the dynamic programming calculation. We describe how this technique leads to significant runtime savings for HMM database scanning on a standard off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array (FPGA). We have constructed a linear systolic array to perform pairwise sequence distance computations using dynamic programming. This results in an implementation with significant runtime savings on a standard FPGA. in this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm by modifying the computationally repeated portion of the algorithm by FPGA hardware custom instructions. We present a reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate array). This results in an implementation of ClustalW with significant runtime savings on a standard off-the-shelf FPGA. The accelerator implements a version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for nucleotide sequence alignment. Sequence lengths are constrained only by available memory; the product of sequence lengths in the current implementation can be up to 2(22). The machine is implemented as two NuBus boards connected to a Mac IIf/x, using a mixture of TTL and FPGA technology clocked at 10 MHz."
Aren't Ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) enriched in segmental duplications?,yes,"Here we address the process by which CNVs become depleted of UCEs. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state.  ULEs are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications. Interestingly, human UCEs have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs). In addition, here we show that these elements are preferentially found in pathogenic deletions (enrichment ratio 3.6 vs. 0.5 in duplications), and that this association is not related with a higher content of genes. In contrast, pathogenic CNVs lacking UCEs showed almost a threefold higher content in genes We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. Mammalian ultraconserved elements are strongly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Notably, of the UCEs that are found in segmental duplications or copy number variants, the majority overlap exons, indicating, along with other findings presented, that UCEs overlapping exons represent a distinct subset. Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are strongly depleted from segmental duplications and copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome, suggesting that deletion or duplication of a UCE can be deleterious to the mammalian cell. Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants.

Isn't polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?,yes,"The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation.  Most eukaryotic genes express mRNAs with alternative polyadenylation sites at their 3' ends Polyadenylation is the non-template addition of adenosine nucleotides at the 3'-end of RNA, which occurs after transcription and generates a poly(A) tail up to 250-300 nucleotides long. Polyadenylation is a process of endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, followed by addition of up to 250 adenosine residues to the 3' end of the mRNA. Plant mitochondrial polyadenylated mRNAs are degraded by a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity, which proceeds unimpeded by stable secondary structures. We show that a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity is responsible for the preferential degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs as compared with non-polyadenylated mRNAs, and that 20-30 adenosine residues constitute the optimal poly(A) tail size for inducing degradation of RNA substrates in vitro. The diversity of polyadenylation sites suggests that mRNA polyadenylation in prokaryotes is a relatively indiscriminate process that can occur at all mRNA's 3'-ends and does not require specific consensus sequences as in eukaryotes. Polyadenylation of premessenger RNAs occurs posttranscriptionally in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells by cleavage of the precursor and polymerization of adenosine residues. However, under certain conditions, poly(A) tracts may lead to mRNA stabilization. From these results, we propose that in plant mitochondria, poly(A) tails added at the 3' ends of mRNAs promote an efficient 3'- to 5'- degradation process.. Auxiliary downstream elements are required for efficient polyadenylation of mammalian pre-mRNAs. Transcription in these cells is polycistronic. Tens to hundreds of protein-coding genes of unrelated function are arrayed in long clusters on the same DNA strand. Polycistrons are cotranscriptionally processed by trans-splicing at the 5' end and polyadenylation at the 3' end, generating monocistronic units ready for degradation or translation We have devised a simple chromatographic procedure which isolates five polyadenylation factors that are required for polyadenylation of eukaryotic mRNA.  During mammalian oocyte maturation, protein synthesis is mainly controlled through cytoplasmic polyadenylation of stored maternal mRNAs. Identification and characterization of a polyadenylated small RNA (s-poly A+ RNA) in dinoflagellates. Thus, polyadenylation seems to be a major component of the RNA editing machinery that affects overlapping genes in animal mitochondria. Pre-mRNA 3'-end processing, the process through which almost all eukaryotic mRNAs acquire a poly(A) tail is generally inhibited during the cellular DNA damage Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs possess 3' ends with a polyadenylate (poly(A)) tail. We previously demonstrated, by limited mutagenesis, that conserved sequence elements within the 5' end of influenza virus virion RNA (vRNA) are required for the polyadenylation of mRNA in vitro. Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors by poly(A) polymerase depends on two specificity factors and their recognition sequences The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed by 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation Formation of mRNA 3' termini involves cleavage of an mRNA precursor and polyadenylation of the newly formed end.  The polyadenylation of RNA is a near-universal feature of RNA metabolism in eukaryotes. The mechanism of RNA degradation in Escherichia coli involves endonucleolytic cleavage, polyadenylation of the cleavage product by poly(A) polymerase, and exonucleolytic degradation by the exoribonucleases,  The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a process common to almost all organisms.  The addition of poly(A) tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to all organisms examined so far.  The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to almost all organisms.  Polyadenylation contributes to the destabilization of bacterial mRNA."
Is Sarcolipin a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Calcium ATPase SERCA?,yes,"The activity of SERCA is regulated by two small, homologous membrane proteins called phospholamban (PLB, also known as PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Detailed structural information explaining this regulatory mechanism has been lacking, and the structural features defining the pathway through which cytoplasmic Ca(2+) enters the intramembranous binding sites of SERCA have remained unknown. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) pump activity is modulated by phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Recent data suggest that SLN could play a role in muscle thermogenesis by promoting uncoupling of the SERCA pump Here we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) pump, is necessary for muscle-based thermogenesis. Sarcolipin (SLN) is a 3 kD membrane protein found in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It has 31 amino acid residues; SLN and phopholamban (PLB) are belong to the same protein family, so they have similar physiological functions. SLN inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) activity and reduces its affinity of Ca(2+), resulting in dysfunction of myocardial contraction and heart failure. Sarcolipin (SLN) is a key regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium. Together, these findings indicate that ablation of SLN results in increased SERCA activity and SR Ca(2+) load, which, in turn, could cause abnormal intracellular Ca(2+) handling and atrial remodeling. Sarcolipin (SLN) inhibits sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) pumps. These results show that 1) SLN regulates Ca(2+)-ATPase activity thereby regulating contractile kinetics in at least some skeletal muscles, 2) the functional significance of SLN is graded to the endogenous SLN expression level, and 3) SLN inhibitory effects on SERCA function are relieved in response to repeated contractions thus enhancing relaxation rates. The SERCA pump was constitutively activated in both atrial and ventricular chambers of the mouse heart by ablating its key regulators, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). The double-knockout (dKO) mice for PLN and SLN showed increased SERCA pump activity, Ca(2+) transients and SR Ca(2+) load, and developed cardiac hypertrophy. Our findings also emphasize the need for dynamic regulation of the SERCA pump by PLN and/or SLN to maintain cardiac contractility in normal conditions and during pathophysiological states. Sarcolipin (SLN) has emerged as an important regulator of the atrial sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ transport. The inhibitory effect of SLN on cardiac SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump can be relieved by beta-adrenergic stimulation, which indicates that SLN is a reversible inhibitor.  Sarcolipin is a novel regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and is expressed abundantly in atria. Our study documented that sarcolipin is a key regulator of SERCA2a in atria. Importantly, our data demonstrate the existence of distinct modulators for the SERCA pump in the atria and ventricles. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane protein that catalyzes the ATP-dependent transport of Ca(2+) from the cytosol to the SR. The activity of SERCA is inhibited by phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), and all these proteins participate in maintaining the normal intracellular calcium handling.  Sarcolipin (SLN) is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it inhibits SERCA (calcium ATPase) by lowering its apparent Ca2+ affinity in a manner similar to that of its homologue phospholamban (PLN). Remarkably, each domain of SLN behaves in a manner similar to that of the corresponding domains in PLN, supporting the hypothesis that both SLN and PLN bind SERCA in the same groove and with similar mechanisms. The role of sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac physiology was critically evaluated by generating a transgenic (TG) mouse model in which the SLN to sarco(endoplasmic)reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) ratio was increased in the ventricle. Overexpression of SLN decreases SR calcium transport function and results in decreased calcium transient amplitude and rate of relaxation. SLN TG hearts exhibit a significant decrease in rates of contraction and relaxation when assessed by ex vivo work-performing heart preparations. We conclude that SLN is a novel regulator of SERCA pump activity, and its inhibitory effect can be reversed by beta-adrenergic agonists. Sarcolipin, a homologue of phospholamban, regulates Ca2+ uptake through the interaction with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and is predominantly expressed in the atrial muscle. Sarcolipin (SLN) and phospholamban (PLN) are effective inhibitors of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA).  These results show that NF-SLN expression impairs muscle contractile function by inhibiting SERCA function and diminishing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. Sarcolipin (SLN) is an inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs) in vitro, but its function in vivo has not been defined. NF-SLN cDNA (SLN tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope) was introduced into rat soleus muscle in one hindlimb by plasmid injection and electrotransfer. Sarcolipin (SLN), a regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase of fast-twitch skeletal muscle (SERCA1a), is also expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles where phospholamban (PLN) and SERCA2a are expressed. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by sarcolipin is encoded in its luminal tail. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) are two single-pass membrane proteins that regulate Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), an ATP-driven pump that translocates calcium ions into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating muscle relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) [Research progress of sarcolipin-a new regulatory protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase].

Can't NADPH oxidase be inhibited by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium?,no,"Ang II treatment also led to a significant increment in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, which could be fully abolished by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium, indicating that Ang II enhanced oxidative stress via a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. NOX inhibitors (diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or apocynin) were able to achieve similar results to that of ML-7 except no effect on MLCK activity and MLC20 phosphorylation.  Significant reductions of AII effects on podocyte TRPC6 were also observed after pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium (DPI).  Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation.  Remarkably, Ang-II induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism, as shown by inhibition of ROS production via the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin.  Moreover, NADPH oxidase activation by beta CD (145.5+/-9.0%; control: 98.6+/-1.6%) was also abrogated by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin (100.4+/-3.2%) and diphenylene iodonium (9.5+/-3.3%). We used structurally diverse NADPH oxidase inhibitors, aminoethyl-benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF, 100-1000microM), apocynin (100-1000microM), and diphenylene iodonium (DPI, 3-30microM), to inhibit intrinsic NADPH oxidase activity in N27 cells. Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium. The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin. The effects of diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, on key parameters of PSC activation were evaluated in vitro. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAâ. Diphenylene iodonium is an inhibitor of the respiratory burst-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes. NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAâ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. In addition, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium or apocynin) also prevented microglia proliferation, suggesting that this may be the source of hydrogen peroxide. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium, apocynin, D-(+)-neopterine) also significantly blunted the generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of K(+), Cl(-)-cotransport and apoptosis induced by N-ethylmaleimide. With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium. NADPH-dependent superoxide production by the solubilized oxidase of neutrophils was inhibited 36% by diphenylene iodonium at a 1:1 stoichiometry with the enzyme flavoprotein content. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65 Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38 Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186) The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin ANG II further increased superoxide production in LP only, and this was inhibited by coincubation with diphenylene iodonium or apocynin (inhibitor of NADPH oxidase complex) Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection with siRNAs of MyD88, PKCalpha, Src, p47(phox), p300, and HDAC4. Here we show that cAMP-dependent decidualization can be attenuated or enhanced upon treatment of primary cultures with a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor (diphenylen iodonium) or activator (apocynin), respectively.  With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium.  The inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, and of the mitochondrial electron transport system at complex II by thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), significantly inhibited both AGE-induced ROS production and VCAM-1 expression, whereas these effects were potentiated by rotenone and antimycin A, specific inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and III, respectively.  Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol.  Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects.  The G6PD inhibitor DHEA and the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) prevented both superoxide generation and capacitation in human spermatozoa, but whereas DPI and DHEA inhibited PPP, apocynin did not influence it, suggesting that PPP activation during capacitation is not a response to increased oxidative stress but exerts a role by supplying reducing equivalents to oxygen. Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium.  Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ. Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects. UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors. Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186). Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection w Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65. The use of diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, to investigate the antimicrobial action of human monocyte derived macrophages. NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAβ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation. We compared the pharmacological profiles of the commonly used NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin and 4-(2-amino-ethyl)-benzolsulphonyl-fluoride (AEBSF), as well as the novel triazolo pyrimidine VAS3947. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha rapidly stimulated the rate of hydrogen peroxide produced by isolated microglia, and this was inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, implying that the cytokines were acting directly on microglia to stimulate the NADPH oxidase. The fractions achieved the same effects that known NADPH oxidase inhibitors, such as diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, but they presented better hydrosolubility. Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium."
Aren't deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries associated with congenital disease?,no,Deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries are associated with congenital disease.

Is nimodipine recommended for prevention of vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,yes,"This article discusses some of these unresolved issues, including the use of medications such as nimodipine, antifibrinolytics, statins, and magnesium; coiling or clipping for aneurysm securement; and the prevention and treatment of potential complications. The results of this study were as follows: nimodipine demonstrated benefit following aneurysmal SAH; other calcium channel blockers, including nicardipine, do not provide unequivocal benefit; triple-H therapy, fasudil, transluminal balloon angioplasty, thrombolytics, endothelin receptor antagonists, magnesium, statins, and miscellaneous therapies such as free radical scavengers and antifibrinolytics require additional study. The present results suggest that fasudil is equally or more effective than nimodipine for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm and subsequent ischemic injury in patients undergoing surgery for SAH. Three studies (2 meta-analyses and 1 randomized controlled trial) demonstrated that nimodipine use confers benefits (reduced morbidity and mortality) for patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nimodipine is the only preventative treatment that can be recommended. Nimodipine (Nimotop), HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor (statins) and enoxaparin (Lovenox) were the only drugs with level-1 evidence available for the treatment of vasospasm from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as defined by the US Preventative Services Task Force. The calcium antagonist nimodipine has been shown to reduce the incidence of ischemic complications following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There was no significant difference in the incidence of DINDs (28 vs 30% in the peroral and intravenous groups, respectively) or middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (> 120 cm/second, 50 vs 45%, respectively). Clinical outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale was the same in both groups, and there was no difference in the number of patients with new infarctions on MR imaging. The results suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy between peroral and intravenous administration of nimodipine in preventing DINDs or cerebral vasospasm following SAH. the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia is reduced with nimodipine and avoiding hypovolemia A recommendations (standard) for the prophylaxis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm with oral Nimodipine in good grade patients. Of the 75 patients initially considered for active treatment, 83% underwent surgery within 48 hours of rupture, all received nimodipine, 16% received tissue plasminogen activator to lyse subarachnoid or intraventricular clots, 40% underwent hypertensive treatment, and 7% underwent transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm. All patients with aneurysmal SAH should be treated with the calcium antagonist nimodipine, and in certain circumstances patients should receive anticonvulsants. The following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms; the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists, hypervolaemic haemodilution, and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature. Seven placebo-controlled clinical studies have shown that nimodipine improves the outcome of patients with severe neurological damage due to cerebral vasospasm. In a series of 100 individuals with a ruptured supratentorial aneurysm, who were subjected to aneurysm operation in the acute stage and who subsequently received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, the occurrence of DID with FND was reduced to 5%. There are many possible successful treatment options for preventing vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, and poor neurologic outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, further multicenter RCTs need to be performed to determine if there is a significant benefit from their use. Nimodipine is the only treatment that provided a significant benefit across multiple studies. Absence of symptomatic vasospasm, occurrence of low density areas associated with vasospasm on CT, and occurrence of adverse events were similar between the two groups. The clinical outcomes were more favorable in the fasudil group than in the nimodipine group (p = 0.040). The proportion of patients with good clinical outcome was 74.5% (41/55) in the fasudil group and 61.7% (37/60) in the nimodipine group. Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus, poor outcome and occasionally death, after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Advances in diagnosis and treatment, principally nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations, and endovascular neuroradiology procedures, have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing. Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus to poor outcome and occasionally death. Advances in diagnosis and treatment-principally the use of nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations and endovascular neuroradiology procedures-have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing. Cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia remain common complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and yet therapies for cerebral vasospasm are limited. Despite a large number of clinical trials, only calcium antagonists have strong evidence supporting their effectiveness. The only proven therapy for vasospasm is nimodipine. nimodipine is indicated after SAH and tirilazad is not effective. Fasudil hydrochloride and nimodipine both showed inhibitory effects on cerebral vasospasm. The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm was five of 33 patients in the fasudil group and nine of 32 patients in the nimodipine group. Good recovery evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale was achieved by 23 of 33 patients in the fasudil group and 19 of 34 patients in the nimodipine group. Both drugs significantly improved consciousness levels and neurological deficits such as aphasia. However, fasudil hydrochloride improved motor disturbance more than nimodipine."

Is lumican a secreted protein?,yes,fibroblasts stimulated with the fibrocyte-secreted inflammatory signal tumor necrosis factor-α secrete the small leucine-rich proteoglycan lumican TNF-α-stimulated fibroblasts secrete lumican to promote fibrocyte differentiation. Secreted 70kDa lumican stimulates growth and inhibits invasion of human pancreatic cancer. the elevated level of lumican secretion to extracellular space leads to actin cytoskeletal remodeling followed by an increase in migration capacity of human colon LS180 cells Lumican is a secreted proteoglycan that regulates collagen fibril assembly. This is the first time that the synthesis and secretion of lumican in human melanoma cell lines is reported.
Isn't the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements disfavored in cancer cells?,yes,"Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state."
Isn't aganglionic megacolon a feature of Down syndrome?,no,"Down syndrome (DS) is recognized by characteristic facial features, intellectual disability, and an increased risk for cardiac malformations and duodenal atresia. Recently, Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, has been seen more often among patients with DS Of the 17 patients with HD who were studied, 10 were isolated (58.8%) and seven (41.1%) were associated to other structural abnormalities and psychomotor retardation. Three of the cases in this latter group were due to chromosome pathology (trisomy 21, Down syndrome) The authors report the case of a female infant with Down syndrome, aganglionic megacolon, severe diarrhea, and jejunal biopsy with ultrastructural changes consistent with microvillous atrophy. The patient condition improved after a colostomy performed in the setting of the treatment of Hirschprung disease Hirschsprung disease, or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is commonly assumed to be a sex-modified multifactorial trait. To test this hypothesis, complex segregation analysis was performed on data on 487 probands and their families. Demographic information on probands and the recurrence risk to relatives of probands are presented. An increased sex ratio (3.9 male:female) and an elevated risk to sibs (4%), as compared with the population incidence (0.02%), are observed, with the sex ratio decreasing and the recurrence risk to sibs increasing as the aganglionosis becomes more extensive. Down syndrome was found at an increased frequency among affected individuals but not among their unaffected sibs, and the increase was not associated with maternal age Intestinal microvillous atrophy in a patient with Down syndrome and aganglionic megacolon.

Does HER2 under-expression lead to favorable response to trastuzumab?,no,"over-expression of HER2 is reported in approximately 20% of gastric tumours, challenging the use of targeted therapies.  In patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer, addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy did not increase the incidence of adverse events. treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer: trastuzumab, Trastuzumab has demonstrated clinical activity in several types of HER2-overexpressing epithelial tumors, such as breast and metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.  An example is the established benefit of trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer; a clear definition of HER2-positivity and the assay reproducibility have, however, remained unanswered.  Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody targeted to the Her2 receptor and approved for treatment of Her2-positive breast cancer. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) is an important target for the treatment of the breast cancers in which it is overexpressed. However, no approved anti-HER2/neu therapy is available for the majority of breast cancer patients, who express HER2/neu at low levels (with scores of 1+ or 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-negative). The humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) is useful in the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers, HercepTestTM (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) is an immunohistochemical assay that detects HER2/neu gene products, and evaluates the overexpression status of the HER2/neu protein in determining eligibility for the Trastuzumab (HerceptinR, Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA) therapy."
Isn't myasthenia gravis associated with osteoporosis?,no,"We performed PVP in 4 patients with generalized MG associated with recent steroid-induced symptomatic VFs.  In this case report, we used tacrolimus to successfully treat a 13-year-old boy with ocular MG who had suffered from severe steroid complications, including a failure of thrive and osteoporosis.  INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk.  RESULTS: Compared to the control cohort, there was no statistically significant increased risk observed in patients with MG for any fracture (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.11; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.47) or osteoporotic fractures (AHR 0.98 [95 % CI 0.67-1.41]). Further, use of oral glucocorticoids up to a cumulative dose exceeding 5 g prednisolone equivalents did not increase risk of osteoporotic fracture (AHR 0.99 [95 % CI, 0.31-3.14]) compared with MG patients without glucocorticoid exposure. The RANKL/OPG ratio and indices of bone metabolisms are also not affected by THX, although THX increases the levels of IL-7 and RANKL. Both disorders had been controlled for around 15 years by oral prednisolone and a cholinesterase inhibitor following surgical removal of invasive thymoma and radiotherapy, but muscular weakness due to myalgia and an increase in serum levels of myogenic enzymes, mainly ascribable to the recurrence of PM, reappeared immediately after cessation of these drugs, which was done because the patient had multiple bone fractures and severe osteoporosis due to the long-term corticosteroid therapy.  We measured bone density in 36 patients (26 females and 10 males) who had undergone long-term prednisolone administration, and found a decrease in bone density in 31% of female patients and osteoporosis in only 11.5% (three cases). In conclusion, prednisolone-treated patients with myasthenia gravis have an acceptable risk of bone loss if prophylactic medication is administered. INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk. Alendronate should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis who have corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis In this paper we present two cases of young women who developed severe PAO with vertebral fractures: a 42-year-old woman with a family history of osteoporosis, and a 21-year-old woman affected with myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk"

Is paroxetine effective for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder?,yes,"To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the four medications with a US FDA-approved indication for PMDD: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and drospirenone plus ethinyl estradiol (DRSP/EE). All SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and clomipramine) were effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms. Paroxetine has been approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder (PD), generalised anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adults, whereas paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of MDD, SAD, PD and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of PMDD and are recommended as first-line agents when pharmacotherapy is warranted. Currently fluoxetine, controlled-release paroxetine, and sertraline are the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for this indication. When compared with placebo, patients treated with paroxetine 20 mg attained a significant reduction in irritability (difference in median percent change: -23.9, 95% CI = -51.3 to -6.2, p = .014; difference in mean absolute change: -18.6, 95% CI = -32.5 to -4.6, p = .007). A statistically significant difference was not observed when the patients treated with the lower dose of paroxetine (10 mg) were compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected side effects. Intermittent administration of paroxetine 20 mg significantly reduced irritability symptoms in patients with PMDD. All these women had significant improvements in the HAMA, HAMD, CGI, and PRISM calendar. The rate of response to paroxetine treatment lay between 50% and 78.6% in the continuous-treatment group, and 37.5-93.8% in the intermittent-treatment group, as determined at the study end-point. The present results indicate that paroxetine is effective in both continuous and intermittent treatment of oriental PMDD women, and that the effects of active treatment lasted for six consecutive treatment menstrual cycles. Paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of major depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. Continuous treatment with paroxetine reduced premenstrual symptoms effectively with a response rate of 85%. Intermittent treatment was as effective as continuous treatment in reducing irritability, affect lability, and mood swings, but had a somewhat weaker effect on depressed mood and somatic symptoms. Daily Record of Severity of Problems scores were lower in the paroxetine group compared with the placebo group, although the differences were not statistically significant. However, the mean on-treatment Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (clinician-rated) score for the paroxetine group was 17.9 +/- 8.3 compared with 31.5 +/- 11.2 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference = 13.6, P = 0.009). Response (Clinical Global Impressions Scale score of 1 or 2) occurred in 70% of subjects randomized to paroxetine CR and 10% of those assigned to placebo (chi2(1) = 7.5, P = 0.006). The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada recently approved paroxetine for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Patients treated with either dose of paroxetine CR demonstrated significantly greater improvements on the primary efficacy measure (change from baseline in mean luteal phase VAS-Mood scores) and on the majority of secondary efficacy measures compared with patients randomly assigned to placebo. For the treatment of PMDD, luteal phase dosing with 12.5 mg and 25 mg of paroxetine CR is effective and generally well tolerated. A statistically significant difference was observed in favor of paroxetine CR 25 mg versus placebo on the VAS-Mood (adjusted mean difference = -12.58 mm, 95% CI = -18.40 to -6.76; p < .001) and for paroxetine CR 12.5 mg versus placebo (adjusted mean difference = -7.51 mm, 95% CI = -13.40 to -1.62; p = .013). Paroxetine CR doses of 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day are effective in treating PMDD and are well tolerated. At end point, subjects treated with paroxetine CR (12.5 mg and 25 mg) demonstrated significant improvement in VAS-Mood scores compared with those who received placebo (paroxetine CR 12.5 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -8.7 mm; 95% CI, -15.7, -1.7; p =.015; paroxetine CR 25 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -12.1 mm; 95% CI, -18.9, -5.3; p <.001). Both doses of paroxetine CR 12.5 mg and 25 mg daily are effective and well tolerated in patients who suffer from PMDD. Of these agents, sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine (as an extended-release formulation) are approved by the US FDA for luteal phase, as well as continuous, administration. In well designed placebo-controlled trials in patients with major depressive disorder (including a study in the elderly), social anxiety disorder or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), paroxetine CR was consistently superior to placebo with regards to primary endpoints (i.e. mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score [major depressive disorder], Liebowitz social anxiety scale total score and Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement score [social anxiety disorder] and Visual Analogue Scale-Mood score [PMDD]). Paroxetine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive- compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. Studies having compared the efficiency of antidepressants according to their serotonin activity (paroxetine or sertraline versus maprotiline, that is a selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor), showed that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors were significantly more efficient on all symptoms than maprotiline, that was not more efficient than placebo. Paroxetine is a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with currently approved indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. Preliminary data suggest that paroxetine has potential in the treatment of social phobia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. The effects of active treatment were marked by the first active cycle with luteal phase 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores decreasing from 14.9 (+/- 5.3) to 8.2 (+/- 4.9) in the first, 7.8 (+/- 5.1) in the second, and 7.8 (+/- 6.8) in the third active treatment cycles (F[1,13] = 17.6; p < 0.0001). The most conservative measure, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), revealed that 7 of 14 patients had a complete response (CGI = 1 or 2) whereas 4 patients had a partial response (CGI = 3). These open trial findings are consistent with the notion that paroxetine is effective in the acute phase for the treatment of PDD. The rating of premenstrual irritability, depressed mood, increase in appetite, and anxiety/tension was markedly lower during treatment with paroxetine than before, and this reduction in symptomatology appeared unabated for the entire treatment period."
Are there any animal models for Niemann-Pick C1 disease?,yes,"Several animal models were used to analyze the impaired pathways.  We investigated components of the surfactant system in both NPC1 mutant mice and felines and in NPC2 mutant mice near the end of their expected life span.  Thus far, studies of NPC mice have been performed mainly to study the brain and neurodegeneration, because degeneration in the brain was known as the primary cause of death in NPC mice.  the NPC1(-/-) mouse is available serving as an appropriate animal model of the human disease, o examine the onset and progression of neuropathological insults in NPC we have systematically examined the CNS of a mouse model of NPC1 (Npc1(-/-) mice) at different stages of the disease course. We have identified a point mutation in Npc1 that creates a novel mouse model (Npc1(nmf164)) of Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC) disease Niemann-Pick type C1-deficient mice, which accumulate intracellular free cholesterol.  hUCB-MSCs were transplanted into the hippocampus of NPC mice in the early asymptomatic stage.

Doesn't dronedarone affect T3 and T4 levels?,yes,"Amiodarone resulted in increased T4, T4/T3 and rT3, whereas dronedarone did not alter the thyroid hormone profile in normal animals. Fifty-five Wistar rats were randomly allocated to a 2-week oral treatment with either vehicle (n=18), amiodarone (30 mg/kg, n=20), or dronedarone (30 mg/kg, n=17). Thyroid function was similar in the 3 groups. Plasma levels of T3, T4, and rT3 were changed after SR 33589 treatment except a decrease in T4 level at the highest dose whilst the T4 T3 ratio and the level of rT3 were dose-dependently increased by amiodarone treatment."
Isn't there evidence to suggest that triiodothyronine has neuroprotective properties in traumatic brain injury?,no,"Exogenous T3 administration provides neuroprotection in a murine model of traumatic brain injury. Treatment with T3 (1.2μg/100g body weight, i.p.) 1h after TBI resulted in a significant improvement in motor and cognitive recovery after CCI, as well as in marked reduction of lesion volumes.  Western blot analysis revealed the ability of T3 to reduce brain trauma through modulation of cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Twenty-four hours after brain trauma, T3-treated mice also showed significantly lower number of TUNEL(+) apoptotic neurons and curtailed induction of Bax, compared to vehicle control. In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle.  The stimulating effect of T3 on peripheral nerve regeneration may have considerable therapeutic potential. The present study provides evidence that the peripheral nervous system has its own system responsible for the local production of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, which may play a key role during the regeneration process. Although it has been hypothesized that T3 may facilitate neuronal regeneration after CNS injury, the 5'-D2 response to brain injury is unknown. The outcome after brain injury is closely correlated with the intensity of these changes, particularly with catecholamine plasma levels and the severity of the low triiodothyronine syndrome. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine appear to enhance regeneration in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS).  T3 treatment influenced the general levels of incorporation of all treated groups over all days postoperation. T3 effects appear to involve an increased sensitivity of the cells of the injured nervous system to the hormone. T3, when administered over an 8 week period, stimulated axonal regeneration in the dorsal cortex and corpus callosum and promoted healing of the wound in the corpus callosum. The results of this investigation suggest that the use of T3 in the clinical treatment of injury to the central nervous system may be of less value than the work of earlier authors had indicated. In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle"
Are proteasome inhibitors good candidates for treatment of leukemia and solid tumors?,yes,"We show that treatment with b-AP15 inhibited tumor progression in four different in vivo solid tumor models and inhibited organ infiltration in an acute myeloid leukemia model. Our results show that the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle is a new anticancer drug target We further found that ATO targets AME via both myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS1) and EVI1 moieties and degrades EVI1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and MDS1 in a proteasome-independent manner. Our results suggest that ATO could be used as a part of targeted therapy for AME-, AML1/MDS1-, MDS1/EVI1-, and EVI1-positive human cancers. Previously we had shown the synergic effect of bortezomib and thiostrepton in breast cancer cells in vitro, where sub-apoptotic concentrations of both proteasome inhibitors resulted in synergic increase in cell death when combined as a treatment. Here, we administered such a combination to MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors in vivo, and found that the effect of complementary proteasome inhibitors reduced tumor growth rates more efficiently than compared with when administered alone. Addition of a proteasome inhibitor to anti-hormonal therapy resulted in a clinical benefit rate of 22% in a limited number of patients with endocrine resistant and progressive metastatic breast cancer. Taken together, these data support the clinical development of MLN9708 for both hematologic and solid tumor indications. Bortezomib has minimal activity as a single-agent in the treatment of recurrent platinum-sensitive EOC/PPC Our study indicates a molecular mechanism by which the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells is regulated by the level of GRP78 as well as preferential induction of GRP78 or CHOP upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Our experiments therefore suggest a novel approach toward sensitization of thyroid cancer cells to proteasome inhibitors. Bortezomib (PS-341) is a novel antineoplastic agent that is well tolerated at doses not exceeding 3.0 mg (equivalent to 1.75 mg/m2), repeated on D1 and D4 every other week. This dose correlates with 70% inhibition of 20S proteasome activity. The maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of bortezomib in this schedule is 1.6 mg/m(2). Biologic activity (inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B-related markers) and antitumor activity is seen in AIPCa at tolerated doses of bortezomib. Given the results of this trial, it is safe and reasonable to recommend treatment with PS341 on the schedule used in this trial at 1.56 mg/m2/dose in Phase II trials. Particular care should be taken with patients with preexisting neuropathy The successes of proteasome inhibitors in MM are now being translated to other hematologic malignancies, including acute leukemia Such efforts have led to bortezomib, the first FDA approved proteasome inhibitor now used as a frontline treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), relapsed/refractory MM and mantle cell lymphoma We recently reported the impact and mechanisms of carfilzomib and oprozomib, second-in-class proteasome inhibitors with higher specificities and reduced toxicities, against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Carfilzomib and oprozomib potently inhibit HNSCC cell survival and the growth of HNSCC tumors"
Can cognitive behavioral therapy improve fatigue in cancer patients?,yes,"Physical activity, educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have the most supportive data and can be recommended to patients with confidence.  For women undergoing radiotherapy (3 RCTs), hypnosis combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy improved distress and fatigue. Patients in the CBT group reported a significantly larger decrease in fatigue scores than patients in the waiting list group. However, relative to VCBT-I, PCBT-I was associated with significantly greater improvements of insomnia severity, early morning awakenings, depression, fatigue, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep.  CBT-I may also improve mood, fatigue, and overall quality of life, and can be successfully delivered through a variety of treatment modalities, making it possible to reach a broader range of patients who may not have access to more traditional programs.  No group differences in improvement were noted relative to QOL, fatigue, or mood.  In case of persistent fatigue, personalized cognitive behavioral therapy can be considered. ONCLUSION: The results support CBTH as an evidence-based intervention to control fatigue in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer.  Severe fatigue after cancer treatment can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but it is unclear whether CBT has an effect on cognitive functioning. CONCLUSION: CBT for post-cancer fatigue has already been shown to be an effective therapy.  Frequently reported side effects include cancer-related fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and psychological distress. Exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions have counteracted such adverse effects in other cancer populations.  There is evidence from methodologically rigorous controlled trials that exercise, psycho-educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia are effective in the treatment of CRF, and a wide range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions has shown initial promise in single-arm pilot studies with small, heterogeneous samples.  CONCLUSIONS: Physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy and physical training alone had significant and beneficial effects on fatigue compared with no intervention. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training. RESULTS: Imagery/hypnosis and CBT/CST interventions have produced improvement in all the three cancer-related symptoms individually: pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling indicated that for weekly FACIT fatigue data, there was a significant effect of the CBTH intervention on the rate of change in fatigue (p < .05), such that on average, CBTH participants' fatigue did not increase over the course of treatment, whereas control group participants' fatigue increased linearly. ONCLUSION: The results suggest that CBTH is an effective means for controlling and potentially preventing fatigue in breast cancer radiotherapy patients. Results were consistent with the view that CBTH was effective in managing fatigue and skin discomfort, and increasing relaxation. RESULTS: Participants in the Internet group showed significant improvements at post-assessment compared with those in the control group in overall insomnia severity (F(1,26) = 22.8; p<0.001), sleep efficiency (F(1,24) = 11.45; P = 0.002), sleep onset latency (F(1,24) = 5.18; P = 0.03), soundness of sleep (F(1,24) = 9.34; P = 0.005), restored feeling upon awakening (F(1,24) = 11.95; P = 0.002), and general fatigue (F(1,26) = 13.88; P = 0.001).  Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) has alleviated fatigue and improved QOL of cancer patients; however, little is known about the effects of nurse-led CBT on breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training.

Is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis caused by the Measles vaccine?,no,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a potentially fatal complication of measles.  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal complication of measles. We reviewed California cases from 1998-2015 to understand risk f Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis should be eliminated by measles vaccination The mean interval between measles infection and onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was 6.5 years (range = 3-11 years). Active surveillance of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis for those with measles infection during the 1988 outbreak is necessary to conduct multicenter drug trials for this devastating disease.<br> There has been an increasing trend of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in southern China after the measles outbreak in 1988. The prevalence rate of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in Hong Kong and Macau in 2002 was 1 per million total population or 5.5 per million children. Because a positive correlation was found between the prevalence of measles and the onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, particularly among children infected at an early age, it is vital to eradicate measles infection by vaccination.<br> Incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis following measles and measles vaccination in Japan. UNLABELLED Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), in the majority of cases, is caused by the wild measles virus, although there are some reports relating SSPE to vaccination. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the measles (rubeola) virus and is most often seen in children. There was no indication that measles vaccine can induce SSPE. Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare lethal disease of children and young adults due to persistence of measles virus (MeV) in the brain, is caused by wild type (wt) MeV.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), in the majority of cases, is caused by the wild measles virus, although there are some reports relating SSPE to vaccination. Measles can persist in the central nervous system and cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a progressive disease that is almost always fatal. However, because of the median 8-year interval between measles and onset of SSPE, The prevention of endemic circulation of measles virus in England and Wales through the high coverage achieved with MMR vaccine, together with the measles/rubella vaccination campaign of 1994, has resulted in the near elimination of SSPE. We applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the measles virus genome in specimens from a 12-year-old boy with SSPE who had received measles vaccine 10 years before and had no history of apparent natural measles. The oligonucleotide primers for PCR were prepared based on the nucleotide sequence of the F and NP genes of the measles virus Edmonston strain.RESULTS: F and NP genes were detected in both the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analysis of the F gene showed that the patient's virus was different from that of the vaccine strain. Judging from these results, it was likely that the SSPE-associated strain in this case was derived from the wild-type rather than the vaccine strain subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a late, rare and usually fatal complication of measles infection.

Is p100 the precursor protein molecule of the NF-kappaB transcription factor subunit p50?,no,"We previously reported that alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice, which have a natural loss-of-function mutation in the Nik gene, which encodes a kinase essential for the processing of p100 to p52 in the alternative nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, show mild osteopetrosis with an increase in several parameters of bone formation:  Proteolytic processing of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 generates the active NF-kappaB2 subunit p52, which in turn transcriptionally up-regulates p100 expression.  The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation. NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel. The non-canonical pathway based on processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 plays a critical role in controlling B cell function and lymphoid organogenesis. Processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly controlled, which is important for proper function of NF-kappaB. Processing of NF-kappa B2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly regulated.  Processing of the NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is an important step of NF-kappaB regulation. Targeted disruption of the Rel/NF-kappaB family members NF-kappaB2, encoding p100/p52, and RelB in mice results in anatomical defects of secondary lymphoid tissues. Here, we show that in T cells infected with the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), IKKalpha is targeted to a novel signaling pathway that mediates processing of the nfkappab2 precursor protein p100, resulting in active production of the NF-kappaB subunit, p52. nfkb2 encodes two members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins: p52 and p100. The p100 polypeptide has been proposed to serve as a precursor of p52, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of p100. In most cells, small amounts of p52 are produced relative to the levels of p100, unlike the usually balanced production of nfkb1-derived p50 and p105.  The alternative or second pathway proceeded via NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK)-, IKKalpha-, and protein synthesis-dependent processing of the inhibitory NF-kappaB2 p100 precursor protein to the p52 form and resulted in a delayed but sustained activation of primarily RelB-containing NF-kappaB dimers. In one exceptional case, generation of the p50 subunit of the transcriptional regulator NF-kappaB, the precursor protein p105 is processed in a limited manner: the N-terminal domain yields the p50 subunit, whereas the C-terminal domain is degraded Proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor (NF-kappa B1) generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B p105 (NFKB1) acts in a dual way as a cytoplasmic IkappaB molecule and as the source of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit upon processing The p50 subunit of NF-kappa B is derived from the amino terminus of a 105 kilodalton precursor Regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB involves proteasome-mediated processing of the NF-kappaB1 p105 precursor protein, which generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB This effort identified NF-kappaB1 (p105), an atypical IkappaB molecule and the precursor of NF-kappaB subunit p50 NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation"
Isn't the gene SLC6A2 associated with orthostatic intolerance?,no,"Orthostatic intolerance is a debilitating syndrome characterized by tachycardia on assumption of upright posture. The norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) has been implicated in a genetic form of the disorder.  Thus attenuated baroreflex function and reduced sympathetic outflow may contribute to the orthostatic intolerance of severe NET deficiency. A mutation in the human norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) associated with orthostatic intolerance disrupts surface expression of mutant and wild-type transporters.  Recently, our laboratory reported a polymorphism in the human NET (hNET) gene A457P in an individual with the autonomic disorder orthostatic intolerance (OI).  Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human NET (hNET) gene that influence transporter function can contribute to disease, such as the nonfunctional transporter, A457P, identified in orthostatic intolerance.  Orthostatic intolerance is not necessarily related to a specific mutation (Ala457Pro) in the human norepinephrine transporter gene. We propose that chromatin-modifying events associated with SLC6A2 gene suppression may constitute a mechanism of POTS. The goal of the present study was to further characterize the role and regulation of the SLC6A2 gene in POTS. In the absence of altered SLC6A2 gene sequence or promoter methylation, this reduced expression was directly correlated with chromatin modifications.  We propose that chromatin-modifying events associated with SLC6A2 gene suppression may constitute a mechanism of POTS. A coding mutation in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) sequence has been reported in 1 family kindred only. The goal of the present study was to further characterize the role and regulation of the SLC6A2 gene in POTS."
Isn't amantadine effective for treatment of disorders conciousness?,no,"We here provide a systematic overview of the therapeutic effects of amantadine, apomorphine and zolpidem in patients recovering from coma. Evidence from clinical trials using these commonly prescribed pharmacological agents suggests positive changes in the neurological status in patients, leading sometimes to dramatic improvements. Pharmaceuticals that act in the oxygen based amino acid systems of the brain include the GABAergic medications zolpidem and baclofen, while those that act in the monoamine axes include the dopaminergic medications L Dopa, amantadine, bromocriptine, apomorphine and methylphenidate, and the noradrenergic and serotonergic medications desipramine, amitriptyline, protriptyline and fluoxetine.  Sporadic cases of recovery from a DOC have been reported after the administration of various pharmacological agents (baclofen, zolpidem, amantadine etc.). Amantadine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness after traumatic brain injury. Preliminary studies have suggested that amantadine may promote functional recovery.  During the 4-week treatment period, recovery was significantly faster in the amantadine group than in the placebo group, as measured by the DRS score (difference in slope, 0.24 points per week; P=0.007), indicating a benefit with respect to the primary outcome measure.  Amantadine accelerated the pace of functional recovery during active treatment in patients with post-traumatic disorders of consciousness. Sporadic cases of dramatic recovery from DOC after the administration of various pharmacological agents, such as baclofen, zolpidem and amantadine, have been recently supported by intriguing scientific observations.  According to the 16 eligible studies, medical management by dopaminergic agents (levodopa, amantadine), zolpidem and median nerve stimulation, or surgical management by deep brain stimulation, extradural cortical stimulation, spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal baclofen have shown to improve the level of consciousness in certain cases.  Higher exposure of amantadine (average concentration of amantadine during 6 mg/kg/day > 1.5 mg/L) may be associated with better recovery of consciousness.  Based on the preliminary data, higher dosing may be considered in the setting of brain injury. Patients treated with PK-Merz exhibited the more significant restoration of consciousness and better dynamics (regress) of neurological deficit with the most intensive restoration of neurological deficit in the first day that allows to recommend the use of amantadine sulfate in the first hours of ischemic stroke and for the prevention of reperfusion damage in recanalisation therapy of ischemic stroke. There was no significant difference in the slopes of recovery during either arm for the Coma/Near-Coma Scale (P = 0.24) or the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (P = 0.28), although improvements in consciousness were noted by the physician during weeks when amantadine was given (P = 0.02).  This study suggests that amantadine facilitates recovery of consciousness in pediatric acquired brain injury and provides important information necessary to design future more definitive studies. The study has shown a positive effect of this drug at coma emergence, which manifested itself as clinical improvement and a better outcome of the disease. This article will review the evidence for the use of psychostimulants (methylphenidate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buproprion), Parkinson's medications (amantadine, bromocriptine, carbidopa/levodopa), anticonvulsants (valproic acid), modafinil (Provigil), lactate, hyperbaric oxygen chamber, electroconvulsive therapy, and transmagnetic stimulation, in patients following a head injury. Of the psychoactive medications, amantadine hydrochloride was associated with greater recovery and dantrolene sodium was associated with less recovery, in terms of the DRS score at 16 weeks but not the time until commands were followed."
Isn't the protein product of the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) a deubiquitinating enzyme?,no,"CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant predisposition to multiple benign neoplasms of the skin known as cylindromas. The CYLD protein is a deubiquitinating enzyme that acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB and JNK signaling through its interaction with NEMO and TNFR-associated factor 2. CYLD, a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), is a critical regulator of diverse cellular processes, ranging from proliferation and differentiation to inflammatory responses, via regulating multiple key signaling cascades such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. CYLD is a lysine 63-deubiquitinating enzyme that inhibits NF-κB and JNK signaling. Tumor suppressor gene CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme which negatively regulates various signaling pathways by removing the lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from several specific substrates. The cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that has been implicated in various aspects of adaptive and innate immune responses.  The cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) was identified as a tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (Brooke-Spiegler syndrome), an autosomal-dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme acting as a negative regulator of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway by removing lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains from NF-κB activating proteins.  Here, we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD, the familial cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene, as a negative regulator of proximal events in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. CYLD is a tumour-suppressor gene that is mutated in a benign skin tumour syndrome called cylindromatosis. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Cyld encodes a 956-amino acid deubiquitinating enzyme (CYLD), which is a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD has been identified as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB.  CYLD, a tumor suppressor gene, has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB. Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD is correlated with tumorigenesis. We show that dCYLD encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that deubiquitinates dTRAF2 and prevents dTRAF2 from ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB pathway activation. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) form a family of cysteine proteases that digests ubiquitin chains and reverses the process of protein ubiquitination. Despite the identification of a large number of DUBs, their physiological functions remain poorly defined. Here we provide genetic evidence that CYLD, a recently identified DUB, plays a crucial role in regulating the peripheral development and activation of B cells. The cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant condition that confers a predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. CYLD has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB. Therefore, loss of CYLD function correlates with tumorigenesis. Cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) is a ubiquitously expressed deubiquitinating enzyme, which interacts with members of the NF-κB signaling pathway and attenuates NF-κB and JNK signaling. The cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene (Cyld) encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme (CYLD) with immunoregulatory function. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Here, we examined the potential role of the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD (cylindromatosis), mutation of which has been reported to cause familial cylindromatosis. The deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD), loss of which was originally reported to cause a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, has been identified as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB in vitro. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) is a ubiquitously expressed deubiquitinating enzyme, which interacts with members of the NF-�B signaling pathway and attenuates NF-�B and JNK signaling. Cylindromatosis (CYLD) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is altered in patients with familial cylindromatosis, a condition characterized by numerous benign adnexal tumors.

Isn't imatinib an antidepressant drug?,yes,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. Surgery remains the elective treatment. We retrospectively compared two group of patients, who underwent surgery for GIST before and after Imatinib advent in order to analyze the recurrence and survival rate. Adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for 3 years duration is a standard treatment in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs R1 surgery (versus R0) alone is not an indication for adjuvant imatinib in low-risk GIST. Treatment is not recommended in an imatinib-insensitive D842V-mutated GIST Prognostic factors such as tumor size, mitotic rate and presence of metastases may provide an indication for adjuvant imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment. Here we present a young patient with a large GIST with high-risk features who is in complete remission after surgical excision and adjuvant IM treatment. This patient is the only colon-located CD117-positive case where IM was administered. Imatinib mesylate is the sole BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as first-line treatment of accelerated-phase (AP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). imatinib mesylate could be a therapeutic target of strategies against osteosarcoma tumors. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is well-established as a potentially curative treatment for patients who have chronic myeloid leukemia. The success of imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as initial therapy has changed the treatment paradigm for this disease. Imatinib plus hydroxyurea is well tolerated among patients with meningioma but has modest anti-tumor activity for this indication. Ki67 correlated with time to recurrence (p=0.022). Ki67 >11% was taken as the indication to start imatinib chemotherapy (sensitivity 61.5%, specificity 92.0%, p=0.022). Significant pharmacokinetic interactions have already been shown between St. John's Wort (SJW) and the anticancer drugs imatinib and irinotecan. for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. Imatinib mesylate, an orally administered kinase inhibitor that targets the Kit (CD117) protein, currently has 10 approved indications including treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The drugs were assessed according to clinical evidence on efficacy and safety, based on Micromedex categorization, on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Indications present in the legal documentation were compared to the indications approved by regulatory agencies. RESULTS: Bevacizumab, capecitabine, cetuximab, erlotinib, rituximab, imatinib, and temozolomide Bcr-Abl, an oncogene responsible for CML Bcr-Abl-expressing cells showed resistance to death activated by spindle defects, reversed by imatinib. Imatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is first-line treatment in patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST. Surgical indication for metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) treated with imatinib is not yet established. Surgery of residual disease upon best clinical response seems associated with survival benefit compared with historical controls in similar patient collectives treated with imatinib alone. To explore the effect of preoperative imatinib mesylate (IM) in patients with unresectable or locally advanced primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) The patient had been diagnosed 14 months earlier and had been submitted to surgery, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemotherapy. On clinical suspicion of recurrence 5 months later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion at the site of preceded surgery, which was treated by imatinib mesylate Radical surgery remains the most effective method of GIST treatment. In inoperable/metastatic lesion the treatment of choice is tyrosinase kinase inhibitor--imatinib. Imatinib mesylate (STI571), a specific Bcr-Abl inhibitor, has shown a potent antileukemic activity in clinical studies of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Imatinib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit, was used as an adjuvant chemotherapy in two patients who underwent curative surgery for recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for 3 years duration is a standard treatment in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs."
Aren't shadow enhancers associated with development?,no,"Critical developmental control genes sometimes contain ""shadow"" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes These results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes ""bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions"" Shadow enhancers flanking the HoxB cluster direct dynamic Hox expression in early heart and endoderm development.  This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development. Regulatory analysis of the HoxA complex reveals that it also has enhancers in the 3' flanking region which contain RAREs and have the potential to modulate expression in endoderm and heart tissues This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development. Recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns: primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or 'shadow', enhancers located at more remote positions. Together, the similarities in their location, enhancer output, and dependence on retinoid signaling suggest that a conserved cis-regulatory cassette located in the 3' proximal regions adjacent to the HoxA and HoxB complexes evolved to modulate Hox gene expression during mammalian cardiac and endoderm development.  This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development."
"Hasn't ""RNA interference"" been awarded Nobel prize?",no,"Since the first unequivocal description of RNA interference (RNAi) in 1998, it has remained one of the hottest topics under investigation, culminating in the award of a Nobel Prize to its discoverers in 2006. RNA interference (RNAi) is considered one of the most powerful genomic tools which allows the study of drug discovery and understanding of the complex cellular processes by high-content screens. This field of study, which was the subject of 2006 Nobel Prize of medicine, has drastically changed the conventional methods of analysis of genes.  Almost 10 years after Fire and Mello received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of this mechanism in flat worms, RNA interference is on the edge of becoming a new class of therapeutics."
Is there a pharmacogenetic test for trastuzumab?,yes,"The clinical need for novel approaches to improve drug therapy derives from the high rate of adverse reactions to drugs and their lack of efficacy in many individuals that may be predicted by pharmacogenetic testing. the assessment of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) expression for trastuzumab therapy of breast cancer HER2 positive breast cancer and the use of the drug Herceptin The dependence on gene copy number or expression levels of HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab and cetuximab (Erbitux), respectively, supports the importance of selecting suitable patient populations based on their pharmacogenetic profile. to explore informed consent issues surrounding the use of the drug Herceptin, widely cited as an example of a novel approach to drug development called pharmacogenetics. Drawing on qualitative semi-structured interviews with 25 UK-based breast cancer specialists, this paper explores Herceptin's disputed epistemological status, as an example of pharmacogenetics or as something out of the ordinary in terms of clinical practice. There have been several success stories in the field of pharmacogenetics in recent years, including the analysis of HER2 amplification for trastuzumab selection in breast cancer Trastuzumab is standard of care in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2⁺ early and advanced breast cancer. HER-2 overexpression as a predictor of response to trastuzumab Pharmacogenomic analysis aspires to identify individuals with specific genetic characteristics in order to predict a positive response or reduce a negative response to a therapeutic modality. Assays are available to detect the HER2 protein receptor or copies of the HER2 gene sequence to determine eligibility for Herceptin treatment or adriamycin treatment in node positive patients, respectively. Determining the HER2 status of breast carcinomas is a prerequisite for the use of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), which has recently been licensed for the treatment of metastatic disease. Laboratory testing of HER2/neu in breast carcinoma has become vital to patient care following the approval of trastuzumab as the first therapy to target the HER2/neu oncoprotein. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed with use of a diagnostic test for the assessment of HER2 overexpression, the HercepTest. To test for HER-2/neu overexpression in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the possible role of the recombinant monoclonal anti-HER-2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To evaluate concordance between local and central laboratory HER2 testing results in patients from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 adjuvant trial of trastuzumab. These findings support the importance of using high-volume, experienced laboratories for HER2 testing to improve the process of selecting patients likely to benefit from trastuzumab therapy. we measured trastuzumab levels in the serum and in cerebrospinal fluid of metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases receiving trastuzumab for HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In a pilot study, metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases and HER2-overexpressing tumors (HercepTest; Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) were included. Monitoring of trastuzumab levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid may enable individualized therapy strategies in metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases, and lead to a better understanding of trastuzumab pharmacokinetics in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Biotin-labeled trastuzumab (BiotHER) can be used to test for HER2 by immunohistochemistry. The results support a role for BiotHER testing in better tailoring trastuzumab-based treatments in patients with advanced HER2-amplified breast cancers. response to anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy trastuzumab."
Is autosomal dominant inheritanced form of Osteogenesis imperfecta caused by mutations in the genes associated with collagen production?,yes,"steogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous bone disorder characterized by recurrent fractures. Although most cases of OI have heterozygous mutations inCOL1A1orCOL1A2and show autosomal dominant inheritance, Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk. The majority of OI cases have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are usually caused by mutations in genes encoding type I collagen  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by low bone mass and recurrent fractures. Most OI cases follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are attributed to mutations in genes encoding type I collagen (COL1A1/COL1A2).  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterised by low bone mineral density resulting in fractures. 85-90% of patients with OI carry a variant in the type 1 collagen genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, which follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by susceptibility to bone fractures, and range in severity from a subtle increase in fracture frequency to death in the perinatal period. Most patients have defects in type I collagen biosynthesis with autosomal-dominant inheritance, but many autosomal-recessive genes have been reported. To investigate mutation of COL1A1 gene and analyze the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in a family with osteogenesis imperfecta Dominant inheritance of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes that encode type I collagen, Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of bone formation, resulting in low bone mass and an increased propensity to fracture. It exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from multiple fractures in utero and perinatal death, to normal adult stature and low fracture incidence. Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I is characterized by bone fragility without significant deformity, osteopenia, normal stature, blue sclerae, and autosomal dominant inheritance. Dermal fibroblasts from most affected individuals produce about half the expected amount of type I collagen, suggesting that the OI type I phenotype results from a variety of mutations which alter the apparent expression of either COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes encoding the chains of type I collagen. Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the COL1A2 and COL1A1 genes of type I collagen.  Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by dominant autosomal mutations in the type I collagen coding genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) in about 85% of individuals, affecting collagen quantity or structure. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders of connective tissue, mainly caused by mutations in the collagen type I genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2). Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. In approximately 90% of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta, mutations in either of the genes encoding the pro-alpha1 or pro-alpha2 chains of type I collagen (COL1A1 or COL1A2) can be identified. Autosomal dominant OI is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. ext-generation sequencing technology was used to screen a panel of known OI genes.RESULTS: In 41 probands, we identified 28 different disease-causing variants of 9 different known OI genes. Eleven of the variants are novel. Ten of the 28 variants are located in COL1A1, five in COL1A2, three in BMP1, three in FKBP10, two in TMEM38B, two in P3H1, and one each in CRTAP, SERPINF1, and SERPINH1.  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures after minimal trauma. OI type V has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and is not caused by mutations in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2.  Detection of a high frequency RsaI polymorphism in the human pro alpha 2(I) collagen gene which is linked to an autosomal dominant form of osteogenesis imperfecta. Osteogenesis imperfecta due to recurrent point mutations at CpG dinucleotides in the COL1A1 gene of type I collagen. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), commonly known as ""brittle bone disease"", is a dominant autosomal disorder characterized by bone fragility and abnormalities of connective tissue. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies have shown that the vast majority of affected individuals have mutations in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes that encode the chains of type I procollagen.  Osteogenesis imperfecta is normally caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2."
Aren't there Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) in plant genomes?,no,"Conservation and functional element discovery in 20 angiosperm plant genomes The detailed view of conservation across angiosperms revealed not only high coding-sequence conservation but also a large set of previously uncharacterized intergenic conservation Conserved noncoding sequences highlight shared components of regulatory networks in dicotyledonous plants Using a comparative genomics approach with four dicotyledonous plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, papaya [Carica papaya], poplar [Populus trichocarpa], and grape [Vitis vinifera]), we detected hundreds of CNSs upstream of Arabidopsis genes Long identical multispecies elements in plant and animal genomes. Using an alignment-free information-retrieval approach, we have comprehensively identified all long identical multispecies elements (LIMEs), which include both syntenic and nonsyntenic regions, of at least 100 identical base pairs shared by at least two genomes In contrast, among six plant genomes, we only found nonsyntenic LIMEs  Although complex LIMEs were found in both animal and plant genomes, they differed significantly in their composition and copy number Ultraconserved elements between the genomes of the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and rice We consequently compared the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, which diverged about 200 million years ago, and identified 25 ultraconserved elements that are longer than 100 bp ultraconserved elements in plants tend to occur in clusters and locate at noncoding regions the functions of these plant ultraconserved elements and the reasons why they are practically frozen during the evolution of millions of years remain a mystery Conserved noncoding sequences in the grasses  Using a local sequence alignment set to deliver only significant alignments, we found one or more CNSs in the noncoding regions of the majority of genes studied. Grass genes have dramatically fewer and much smaller CNSs than mammalian genes Conserved noncoding sequences among cultivated cereal genomes identify candidate regulatory sequence elements and patterns of promoter evolution Surveys for conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) among genes from monocot cereal species were conducted to assess the general properties of CNS in grass genomes and their correlation with known promoter regulatory elements Comparisons of orthologous maize-rice and maize-sorghum gene pairs identified 20 bp as a minimal length criterion for a significant CNS among grass genes, with few such CNS found to be conserved across rice, maize, sorghum, and barley"
Can't telomere length shortening be reversed by telomerase?,no,"Telomere length is regulated around an equilibrium set point. Telomeres shorten during replication and are lengthened by telomerase. Disruption of the length equilibrium leads to disease; thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate length at the molecular level.  High telomerase activity is detected in nearly all human cancers but most human cells are devoid of telomerase activity. There is well-documented evidence that reactivation of telomerase occurs during cellular transformation. In humans, tumors can rely in reactivation of telomerase or originate in a telomerase positive stem/progenitor cell, or rely in alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent telomere-length maintenance mechanism.  Together, these observations may provoke a re-evaluation of telomere and telomerase based therapies, both in telomerase inhibition for cancer therapy and telomerase activation for tissue regeneration and anti-ageing strategies. Telomeres progressively shorten throughout life. A hallmark of advanced malignancies is the ability for continuous cell divisions that almost universally correlates with the stabilization of telomere length by the reactivation of telomerase. Telomerase-mediated telomere elongation provides cell populations with the ability to proliferate indefinitely. Telomerase is capable of recognizing and extending the shortest telomeres in cells; Telomerase gene therapy rescues telomere length, bone marrow aplasia, and survival in mice with aplastic anemia."
Isn't there any link between CTF4 and CTF18 during sister chromatid cohesion?,no,"Our results suggest that Elg1, Ctf4, and Ctf18 may coordinate the relative movement of the replication fork with respect to the cohesin ring These data defined two cohesion pathways, one containing CSM3, TOF1, CTF4, and CHL1, and the second containing MRC1, CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding. This provides evidence for cohesion establishment in the context of replication forks and imposes constraints on the mechanism involved Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis We also show that, in contrast to mitosis, RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Cft8), Ctf4 and Chl1 are essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis and for the viability of meiotic products. Ctf8p is a component of Ctf18-RFC, an alternative replication factor C-like complex required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We performed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis with a ctf8 deletion strain as a primary screen to identify other nonessential genes required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion. We then assessed proficiency of cohesion at three chromosomal loci in strains containing deletions of the genes identified in the ctf8 SGA screen. Deletion of seven genes (CHL1, CSM3, BIM1, KAR3, TOF1, CTF4, and VIK1) resulted in defective sister chromatid cohesion Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion CTF4 and CTF18 are required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation. Both exhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II. Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 and the pathway involving the acetylation of Smc3. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion.

Do Parkinson's disease patients experience stridor?,yes,"The authors describe a patient experiencing stridor and dysphagia with confirmed pulmonary restriction and aspiration following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulator adjustment, with a resolution of symptoms and signs when the stimulator was switched off. Stridor was not noted during sleep at night. Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration.  The stridor was specific to MSA.  Patients with MSA can present other clinical features, such as inspiratory stridor and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). We report a patient with pathologically confirmed MSA who presented with a longstanding history of stridor, RBD and autonomic disturbances but did not develop overt parkinsonism or cerebellar signs. This case illustrates that MSA may present clinically without its cardinal motor symptoms, and that stridor and RBD may be clues to recognise the disease in a patient with autonomic failure. Patients with PD did not display sleep hypoventilation, stridor and abnormal central sleep apnea.  DEVELOPMENT: Autonomic disorders such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and disorders involving sweating, fatigue, weight loss or respiratory problems (dyspnea, inspiratory stridor) are highly prevalent and very disabling symptoms. In addition, they may be the main problem in a particular phase of PD (fatigue, stridor) and condition the quality of life of patients with Parkinson.  . Her dyspneic attacks consisting of inspiratory stridor and cyanosis occurred mainly during the wearing-off time and continued for less than 30 min The most commonly reported sleep disorders were sleep fragmentation (52.5%), vocalisation (60%), REM sleep behaviour disorder (47.5%), and nocturnal stridor (19%). Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD Six days after admission, dyspnea and inspiratory stridor were noted, and the respiratory distress worsened.  A patient is described with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe laryngeal stridor. The laryngeal stridor responded to levodopa therapy, and we are not aware that this has been reported previously. The subsequent clinical course of the former eight patients has been typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, whilst the ninth patient has developed postural hypotension, urinary incontinence and respiratory stridor typical of multiple system atrophy.  Although each of five autonomic domains was affected in variable numbers of IPD patients, AD in MSA generally involved more autonomic domains than in IPD, and to a more severe degree, in particular with regard to inspiratory stridor. However, the presence of severe AD, of AD preceding parkinsonism, or of inspiratory stridor, are all individually suggestive of MSA. Apart from dysautonomia, the principal discriminant clinical features that distinguished SND from PD were the early appearance of the following symptoms and signs: (a) severe and atypical progressive parkinsonism characterized by bilateral bradykinesia and rigidity, slowness of gait, postural instability, and falls, and poor or absent response to adequate levodopa treatment; (b) increased tendon reflexes associated or not with frank pyramidal signs, severe dysarthria, and less consistently, dysphagia, stridor, antecollis, and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, which, when present, are highly suggestive of the disease. OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We report a 73-year-old Parkinson's disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions.  RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients were identified.  This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management. RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients were identified. This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients, as this affects management. OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinsons disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinsons disease. METHODS: We report a 73-year-old Parkinsons disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions.

Doesn't armodafinil improve fatigue of glioma patients?,yes,"CONCLUSIONS: While treatment was well-tolerated, an 8-week course of armodafinil did not improve fatigue or QOL in glioma patients undergoing RT in this pilot study.  We evaluated whether armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting medication, improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing RT. Armodafinil did not significantly improve fatigue or QOL based on the 42-day change in FACIT-F fatigue subscale, FACT-G, CFS, or BFI. Further analysis suggests no difference between the arms even after accounting for the potential bias of missing data.

Is there any link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B?,yes,The aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B combine to regulate active promoters in quiescent lymphocytes. We show that the Aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein Ring1B have essential roles in regulating transcriptionally active genes in quiescent lymphocytes. Ring1B and Aurora B bind to a wide range of active promoters in resting B and T cells. Conditional knockout of either protein results in reduced transcription and binding of RNA Pol II to promoter regions and decreased cell viability. Aurora B phosphorylates histone H3S28 at active promoters in resting B cells as well as inhibiting Ring1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes. Our results identify a mechanism for regulating transcription in quiescent cells that has implications for epigenetic regulation of the choice between proliferation and quiescence.

Is alemtuzumab effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia?,yes,"Sequential chemoimmunotherapy of fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide induction followed by alemtuzumab consolidation is effective in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia A central need in this historically refractory tumor is the controlled evaluation of multiagent chemotherapy and its combination with the currently most active single agent, alemtuzumab.  FMC-A is a safe and efficient protocol in T-PLL, which compares favorably to published data. Currently, the best treatment for T-PLL is IV alemtuzumab, which has resulted in very high response rates of more than 90% when given as frontline treatment and a significant improvement in survival.  The patient failed to respond to standard ALL induction chemotherapy, but achieved complete remission following treatment with a fludarabine and alemtuzumab-based regimen. Here we present a rare case of concurrent T-PLL and Kaposi sarcoma who achieved a complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after a very short course of treatment with alemtuzumab.  Recent studies with single-agent alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, have shown improved response rates and survival in patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  The CD52 antigen is expressed at high density on the malignant T-cells and therapy with alemtuzumab, a humanized IgG1 antibody that targets this antigen, has produced promising results.  With the introduction of alemtuzumab, most patients who progressed despite treatment with pentostatin had a major response with a complete remission rate higher than that obtained with pentostatin when used as a first line. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52, Campath-1H) has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of a range of hematological malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Here we report the outcome of two patients with CD4-positive T cell prolymphocytic leukemia treated with CAMPATH-1H. Both patients responded rapidly to treatment and subsequently developed CD4 lymphopenia. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy with a median survival of 7.5 months. Preliminary results indicated a high remission induction rate with the human CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H.  CAMPATH-1H (30 mg) was administered intravenously 3 times weekly until maximal response. The overall response rate was 76% with 60% CR and 16% partial remission (PR). These responses were durable with a median disease-free interval of 7 months (range, 4-45 months).  The conclusion is that CAMPATH-1H is an effective therapy in T-PLL, producing remissions in more than two thirds of patients.  For example, most patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, including those with large tumor burdens and high peripheral white blood cell counts, will enter complete remission using the antibody CAMPATH-1H without any evidence of tumor lysis. Overall response rate to FMC was 68%, comprising 6 complete remissions (all bone-marrow confirmed) and 11 partial remissions. Alemtuzumab consolidation increased the intent-to-treat overall response rate to 92% (12 complete remissions; 11 partial remissions)."

Complications were categorized as carpal tunnel syndrome, other sensibility issues, tendon complications including irritation and rupture, deep infections, complex regional pain syndrome and unidentified DRUJ or scapholunar problems. The overall complication rate was 14.6% (95% CI 11.8-17.7) including carpal tunnel syndrome or change in sensibility in 5.2% and tendon complications in 4.7%.  BACKGROUND: Although median nerve neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are known complications of both untreated and acutely treated distal radius fracture, median neuropathy after correction of distal radius malunion is not commonly reported in hand surgery literature.  Complications were defined as malunion, carpal tunnel syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), persistent pain, and subjective cosmetic deformity of the wrist. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common complication associated with distal radius fractures. The patient also had minor complications of little finger flexor tendon irritation and carpal tunnel syndrome. She underwent implant removal and carpal tunnel release at 8 months. Acute multiple flexor tendon injury and carpal tunnel syndrome after open distal radius fracture. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition and is a well-recognized phenomenon following a distal radius fracture. We report the incidence of late onset post-operative carpal tunnel syndrome (late carpal tunnel syndrome) and late median nerve neuropathy after volar plating of distal radius fracture by conducting a retrospective study on volar plating for distal radius fracture performed during 2002 to 2006. Carpal tunnel syndrome after distal radius fracture. [Case-control study on transverse carpal ligament resection for the prevention of delayed carpal tunnel syndrome after distal radius fracture]. Hand numbness and carpal tunnel syndrome after volar plating of distal radius fracture. Delayed carpal tunnel syndrome presenting after a distal radius fracture has healed is best managed in standard fashion. Being well known and accepted techniques of carpal tunnel release, we believe that the techniques described in this paper provide a viable alternative for carpal tunnel release in the setting of distal radius fracture fixation; with the added advantages of the original minimally invasive techniques. Carpal tunnel syndrome after fracture of the distal radius is a well known complication in adults, but in small children carpal tunnel syndrome is extremely rare.

Isn't low T3 syndrome a prognostic marker in patients with renal insufficiency?,no,"Low T3 was particularly common (44.3 %), and clearly associated with increased 6- and 12-month mortality and decreased overall survival (log rank test, P=0.007).  Increased rT3 may be more common in ESRD patients than previously described, and together with decreased T3 it may serve as an indicator of poor prognosis in subsequent months. The presence of TFT alterations seems to not be associated with clinical and prognostic implications in AKI patients. Multivariate analysis, according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, showed that mortality was best predicted by total triiodothyronine (T3). Finally, low T3 but not low free triiodothyronine was associated with worse all-cause (Likelihood ratio = 45.4; P < 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (Likelihood ratio = 47.8; P < 0.0001) after adjustment for confounding factors.  In Cox analyses, fT3 was a significant predictor of mortality independent of the main traditional as well as non-traditional risk factors. All-cause and CV mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with 'lower' T3 levels than in the 'higher' T3 group (113.4 vs 18.2 events per 1000 patient-years, P<0.001, and 49.8 vs 9.1 events per 1000 patient-years, P=0.001, respectively). The Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed significantly worse cumulative survival rates in the 'lower' T3 group (P<0.001). In the Cox regression analysis, low T3 was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality even after adjusting for traditional risk factors (hazard ratio=3.76, P=0.021).  In CKD patients with proteinuria, low T3 concentration predicted all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event independently of the severity of proteinuria. Low-T3 syndrome is a frequent finding among HD patients, but it does not predict outcome. However, serum fT3 level is a strong and inverse mortality predictor, in part explained by its underlying association with nutritional state and inflammation. These data suggest that low FT3 levels are not predictive for mortality in a subgroup of stable HD patients who could survive more than 12 months. Low fT3 is an independent predictor of death in hemodialysis patients. These data lend support to the hypothesis that thyroid dysfunction is implicated in the high risk of the ESRD population."
The TRPM2 gene isn't associated with development of spontaneous thromboembolism?,yes,"TheTransientReceptorPotentialMelastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a member of G protein coupled receptor superfamily and a novel dual-function protein that possesses both ion channel andAdenosine 5'-DiphosPhataseRibose (ADPR) hydrolase function. TRPM2 is involved in Ca2+signaling in various cells as an endogenous redox sensor for oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, and contributes to cytokine production, insulin release, motility, Ca2+entry and Ca2+-dependent cellular reactions such as endothelial hyper-permeability and apoptosis. We show here that the redox-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel TRPM2 is expressed in the phagosomal membrane and regulates macrophage bactericidal activity through the activation of phagosomal acidification The transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress sensing channel that is expressed in a number of inflammatory cells and therefore it has been suggested that inhibition of TRPM2 could lead to a beneficial effect in COPD patients. TRPM2 is a recently identified TRPM family cation channel which is unique among known ion channels in that it contains a C-terminal domain which is homologous to the NUDT9 ADP-ribose hydrolase and possesses intrinsic ADP-ribose hydrolase activity These results suggest that TRPM2 may participate in antigen-induced extracellular Ca(2+) influx and subsequent degranulation. In addition, TRPM2 inhibitors were shown to improve food allergic reactions in a mouse model. Together, these results suggest that TRPM2 inhibitors suppress MMC degranulation via regulation of the increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt. Thus, TRPM2 may play a key role in degranulation by modulating intracellular Ca(2+) in MMCs. he Na+ and Ca(2+)-permeable melastatin related transient receptor potential 2 (TRPM2) channels can be gated either by ADP-ribose (ADPR) in concert with Ca(2+) or by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), an experimental model for oxidative stress, binding to the channel's enzymatic Nudix domain hese alterations of the extracellular milieu change the activity of transient receptor potential melastatin subfamily member 2 (TRPM2), a nonselective cation channel expressed in the central nervous system and the immune system.  TRPM2 (Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2) is a Ca2+-permeable ion channel that is activated under conditions of oxidative stress.  Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a thermosensitive, Ca2+-permeable cation channel. TRPM2 contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We hypothesized that TRPM2 is important for visceral nociception and the development of visceral hypersensitivity. Here, we describe the computational identification of a melanoma-enriched antisense transcript, TRPM2-AS, mapped within the locus of TRPM2, an ion channel capable of mediating susceptibility to cell death The transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel activated by oxidative stress, has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and more recently in amyloid-induced toxicity Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a calcium-permeable cation channel activated by ADP-ribose or reactive oxygen species.  Transient receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channel expressed in several cell types including hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Moreover, activation of TRPM2 during oxidative stress has been linked to cell death."
Has proteomics been used in the study of Pick's disease?,yes,"In Pick's disease, increased AGE, CML, CEL, HNE and MDAL bands of about 50 kDa were observed in the frontal cortex (but not in the occipital cortex) in association with increased density of glial acidic protein bands. Thus, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and other disorders as well as brain and CSF from animals serving as models of neurological disorders have been analyzed by proteomics.  The present study is designed to investigate expression of peroxiredoxins (Prxs), the newly characterized family of highly conserved antioxidant enzymes, and other antioxidant enzymes in frontal cortex and cerebellum of DS, AD and PD patients using the technique of proteomics.  HMT levels were measured in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of brains of patients with AD, DS, and PiD, and normal aged subjects using proteomics techniques."
Does triiodothyronine (T3) doesn't have cardiac angiogenic effects?,no,"T3-induced cardiac sprouting angiogenesis in adult hypothyroid mice was associated with PDGF-BB, PDGFR-β and downstream activation of Akt. L-T3 significantly increased angiogenesis and cell survival and enhanced the expression of nuclear-encoded transcription factors involved in these processes. T(3) administration restored TRbeta mRNA expression level in AAC hearts to the control level. Rbeta knockout and TRalpha/TRbeta double-knockout mice both exhibited significantly less capillary density in LV compared with wild-type mice. TRbeta in the coronary ECs regulates capillary density during cardiac development, and down-regulation of TRbeta results in coronary microvascular rarefaction during pathological hypertrophy."
Doesn't the majority of the mitochondrial genomes abide to the second parity rule (PR2)?,yes,"a large number of mitochondrial genomes significantly deviate from the 2nd parity rule in contrast to the eubacterial ones mitochondria may be divided into three distinct sub-groups according to their overall deviation from the aforementioned parity rule. The behaviour of the large majority of the mitochondrial genomes may be attributed to their distinct mode of replication, which is fundamentally different from the one of the eubacteria. We tested all available organellar genomes and found that a large number of mitochondrial genomes significantly deviate from the 2nd parity rule in contrast to the eubacterial ones, although mitochondria are believed to have evolved from proteobacteria.

Is there an association between Klinefelter syndrome and breast cancer?,yes,"Screening for breast cancer in male-to-female transsexuals should be undertaken for those with additional risk factors (e.g., family history, BRCA2 mutation, Klinefelter syndrome) and should be available to those who desire screening, preferably in a clinical trial. Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24.7; 95% CI = 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9.78; 95% CI = 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI.  Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome.  The main risk factors include: the mutation of genes BRCA 1 and 2, Klinefelter's syndrome, alcohol, liver disease, obesity.  Although aetiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2) risk factors are already known.  The largest study found 19.2- and 57.8-fold increases in incidence and mortality, respectively, with particularly high risks among 47,XXY mosaics.  CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify which patients with KS are at a high risk of developing MBC and to distinguish between possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones. Major risk factors for developing male BC include clinical disorders involving hormonal imbalances (excess of estrogen or a deficiency of testosterone as seen in patients with Klinefelter syndrome) and a positive family history for breast cancer.  Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia.  Breast cancer in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome is reported. The increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol at the therapy with androgens might be responsible for the development of breast cancer in Klinefelter's syndrome. Patients with a 47,XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have an increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer and germ cell tumors, but rarely malignant hematologic disorders. The frequencies of diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and germ cell neoplasia increases in Klinefelter's syndrome. There is evidence, however, to suggest that Klinefelter's males have an increased risk of breast cancer that approaches three percent. Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC).<br><b>CASE REPORT</b>: We report a 54-year old man was diagnosed as synchronous bilateral breast cancer with Klinefelter syndrome. These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer. Major genetic factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for men include BRCA2 mutations, which are believed to account for the majority of inherited breast cancer in men, Klinefelter syndrome, and a positive family history. Those affected by Klinefelter's syndrome are at increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer. Compared with the general population, men with Klinefelter syndrome had higher mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.0), breast cancer (SMR = 57.8, 95% CI = 18.8 to 135.0), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 6.6) and lower mortality from prostate cancer (SMR = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 0.7). Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC). Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome. Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia. Klinefelter syndrome, in which patients carry XXY chromosome, may be present in men with breast cancer for this reason they often develop gynecomastia.<br> Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC).

Is CREB a key memory protein?,yes,"Human cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor which plays a crucial role in memory The activated CREB is implicated in the regulation of development, protection, learning, memory and plasticity in the nerve system.  A mouse genetic study showed that cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription is required for the formation of social recognition memory. Transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) plays a critical role in memory formation. It is well known that molecules like cAMP response element binding (CREB) and binding protein (CBP) play a crucial role in memory consolidation.  CREB SUMOylation by the E3 ligase PIAS1 enhances spatial memory. Therefore, CREB phosphorylation may be responsible for signal transduction during the early phase of long-term memory formation, whereas CREB SUMOylation sustains long-term memory"
Haven't germline variants been associated to colorectal cancer?,no,"Overall, we identified aberrant transcripts in 8% of the patients (familial cases 30%; early-onset manifestation 21%). In eight of them, two different out-of-frame pseudoexons were found consisting of a 167-bp insertion from intron 4 in five families with a shared founder haplotype and a 83-bp insertion from intron 10 in three patients. The pseudoexon formation was caused by three different heterozygous germline mutations, which are supposed to activate cryptic splice sites We apply OS-Seq to resequence the exons of either 10 or 344 cancer genes from human DNA samples. In our assessment of capture performance, >87% of the captured sequence originated from the intended target region with sequencing coverage falling within a tenfold range for a majority of all targets. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) called from OS-Seq data agreed with >95% of variants obtained from whole-genome sequencing of the same individual. The minor alleles of CD44 rs8193 C>T, ALCAM rs1157 G>A, and LGR5 rs17109924 T>C were significantly associated with increased TTR (9.4 vs. 5.4 years; HR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.35-0.93; P = 0.022; 11.3 vs. 5.7 years; HR, 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33-0.94; P = 0.024, and 10.7 vs. 5.7 years; HR, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.12-0.90; P = 0.023, respectively) and remained significant in the multivariate analysis stratified by ethnicity. In recursive partitioning, a specific gene variant profile including LGR5 rs17109924, CD44 rs8193, and ALDH1A1 rs1342024 represented a high-risk subgroup with a median TTR of 1.7 years (HR, 6.71, 95% CI: 2.71-16.63, P < 0.001). In this study, we identified common germline variants in VEGF-dependent and -independent angiogenesis genes predicting clinical outcome and tumor response in patients with mCRC receiving first-line bevacizumab and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. We identified 22 nonsynonymous somatic mutations of which the majority was of missense type. In germline, three novel nonsynonymous variants were identified in the following genes: CSMD3, EPHB6 and C10orf137, and none of the variants were present in 890 population-matched healthy controls. It is possible that the identified germline variants modulate predisposition to CRC. One patient proved to carry an APC whole-gene deletion; 4 of 25 (16%) patients showed biallelic and 3 of 25 (12%) monoallelic MUTYH mutations. In the three heterozygous subjects no pathogenetic variants were found in OGG1, MTH1, APE1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes. Frequency assessment of MUTYH mutations in healthy subjects showed that only Y165C and G382D reach a subpolymorphic frequency. Scrutinizing the molecular genetic results and family data of 242 index patients with pathogenic APC mutations led to the identification of 10 mosaic cases (4%). C>T transitions were observed in CGA sites in four of the 10 cases with somatic mosaicism, which is significantly more than 26 of the 232 non-mosaic cases (p = 0.02). Phenotypes of patients with somatic mosaicism ranged from an attenuated form of polyposis coli to florid polyposis with major extracolonic manifestations. Altogether 12 previously reported changes and four novel genetic alterations, mostly in intronic sequences, were identified. The results revealed the presence of biallelic germline MYH mutations in two patients. These patients were compound heterozygotes for two of the most common germline mutations c.494 A>G (p.Y165C); c.1,145 G>A (p.G382D). These variants are established to be associated with adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer."
Isn't signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) critical for tumor angiogenesis progression?,no,"(STAT3) is critical for cancer progression by regulating tumor cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Herein, we investigated the regulation of STAT3 activation and the therapeutic effects of Icaritin, a prenyl flavonoid derivative from Epimedium Genus, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).   Overall, these results suggest that Icaritin strongly inhibits STAT3 activation and is a potentially effective therapeutic option for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma we have reviewed important signaling pathways that are closely related to radiosensitization, such as cell cycle arrest, tumor angiogenesis, JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and Mismatch repair Interleukin-27 signaling is mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway via activation of STAT1 and STAT3, which have tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities, respectively. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis are key processes in carcinogenesis. The inhibition of STAT3 activation had no effect on the development of the epithelial phenotype. STAT3 plays a vital role in inducing and maintaining a pro-carcinogenic inflammatory microenvironment and is reported to be a critical mediator of the oncogenic effects of EGFR mutations. STAT3 activation is mediated through JAK family kinases  EESB treatment could significantly suppress the activation of several CRC-related pathways, including STAT3, Erk, and p38 signalings in tumor tissues, and alter the expression of multiple critical target genes such as Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1, CDK4, and p21. These molecular effects lead to the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that SB possesses a broad range of antitumor activities because of its ability to affect multiple intracellular targets Western immunoblotting analyses of mouse lung tissues indicated significantly lower level of pSTAT3 and Mcl-1 in the carcinogen plus DMAPT group relative to the group treated with the carcinogen only. Given the evidence that STAT3 is activated in more than half of lung cancers and it regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, DMAPT is a promising agent for lung cancer chemoprevention in subjects who are at high risk of developing this devastating disease. (STAT3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. It is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at position 705 leading to its dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and activation of gene transcription. Under normal physiological conditions, STAT3 activation is tightly regulated. However, compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis. It regulates cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis that are critical for cancer metastasis STAT3) signaling pathway plays important roles in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, immunity, and tumor cell invasion. In the present study, we investigated the association of interleukin   Phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) regulates many genes that are necessarily expressed in cancer initiation, development, and progression, being involved in proliferation, anti-apoptosis, invasion, angiogenesis, and immune surveillance evasion"
Doesn't HuR bind to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs?,no,"HuR is also overexpressed during tumourigenesis and is abnormally present within the cytoplasm, where it binds to AU-rich elements in the 3'UTRs of target mRNA and post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of its target genes. Human antigen R (HuR) is a ubiquitous 32 kDa protein comprising three RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs), whose main function is to bind Adenylate and uridylate Rich Elements (AREs) in 3' UnTranslated Regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. Human antigen R (HuR) is a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein that modulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The RNA-binding protein HuR binds at 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target transcripts, thereby protecting them against degradation.  ELAV/Hu proteins bind to AU-rich elements (ARE) in mRNAs and regulate their stability from splicing to translation, and the ubiquitous HuR protein has been implicated in cancerous cell growth.  This is achieved by altered expression of the proteins TTP and HuR, which bind 3' untranslated region (UTR) elements in cancer-related genes."
Isn't the SDHAF2 gene encoding a protein necessary for flavination of SDHA?,no,"Pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome is caused by mutations in SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, encoding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and in SDHAF2, required for flavination of SDHA.

Aren't messenger RNA molecules epigenetically methylated?,no,"The most abundant mRNA post-transcriptional modification is N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), which has broad roles in RNA biology. N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modified base in eukaryotic mRNA and has been linked to diverse effects on mRNA fate.  Recently, methylation patterns have also been revealed in mRNA. Surprisingly, the two most commonly studied methylation states in mRNA (m6A and m5C) are found to be enriched in 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions), the target site for the majority of miRNAs. MeT-DB: a database of transcriptome methylation in mammalian cells Methyltranscriptome is an exciting new area that studies the mechanisms and functions of methylation in transcripts. The MethylTranscriptome DataBase (MeT-DB, http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/methylation/) is the first comprehensive resource for N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in mammalian transcriptome. Mammalian messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) contain tens of thousands of posttranscriptional chemical modifications. Among these, the N(6)-methyl-adenosine (m(6)A) modification is the most abundant and can be removed by specific mammalian enzymes. Recent discoveries of reversible N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation on messenger RNA (mRNA) and mapping of m(6)A methylomes in mammals and yeast have revealed potential regulatory functions of this RNA modification. There are several identified methylation modifications in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), such as N(7)-methylguanosine (m(7)G) at the cap, N(6)-methyl-2'-O-methyladenosine (m(6)Am), 2'-O-methylation (Nm) within the cap and the internal positions, and internal N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C)."
Is paramyxovirus involved in human subacute thyroiditis?,no,"Most cases of subacute thyroiditis are caused by a variety of viruses, for example, Coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus. Influenza immunization or infection may cause subacute thyroiditis. Coxsackie virus has been reported to be one of the viruses associated with the disease. The etiology of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (SAT) is obscure, although it is postulated to be associated with viral infections and genetic factors. The results suggest that SAT is not usually associated with acute infections No evidence was obtained to support the proposed role of enteroviruses as an important etiologic agent of SAT. The viral antibodies evaluated were those of Influenza A and B, Coxsackie A9, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 and B6, Echo 3, 7, 11 and 12, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, and Adeno 8 virus. The following results were obtained: In class I HLA typing, the frequency of HLA-Bw35 in SAT was 67.4%, which was significantly (p less than 0.0001) higher than that in the control (14.1%). On the other hand, the frequency of Cw1 in SAT (14.6%) was significantly (p less than 0.01) lower than that of the control (32.1%), and that of Cw3 (65.2%) was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that of the control (46.5%)."
Is Obeticholic Acid used for treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis?,yes,"Obeticholic acid in primary biliary cholangitis. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study including 217 patients with primary biliary cholangitis, the authors show that obeticholic acid (a potent farnesoid X agonist) administered with ursodeoxycholic acid or as monotherapy significantly decreases serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin when compared to placebo. Obeticholic acid (Ocaliva(TM)) is a farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonist that is being developed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various liver diseases, and has recently been granted accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate ursodeoxycholic acid.  Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist which has been evaluated as a second line therapy in PBC and has recently been licenced by the FDA. OCA will be the first stratified therapy introduced in PBC, however confirmatory trial and real life data are needed to confirm that suggestive biochemical improvements are matched by improvement in key clinical outcomes. Obeticholic acid for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in adult patients: clinical utility and patient selection. A series of clinical trials of OCA in PBC, primarily in combination with UDCA, have established that OCA leads to significant reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase that are predicted to lead to improved clinical outcomes, while dose-dependent pruritus has been the most common adverse effect. On the basis of these studies, OCA was given conditional approval by the US Food and Drug Administration with plans to establish the long-term clinical efficacy of OCA in patients with advanced PBC. Although obeticholic acid was approved by the FDA for the treatment of PBC in May 2016, this development occurred after the symposium presentation.  While several agents are being studied in combination with UDCA, monotherapy with the novel agent obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, has also shown promising results. Obeticholic acid (Ocaliva(TM)) is a farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonist that is being developed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various liver diseases, and has recently been granted accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate ursodeoxycholic acid.

Have studies shown that there is no link between DNA methylation patterns and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?,no,"Using pre-deployment SKA2 methylation levels and childhood trauma exposure, we found that the previously published suicide prediction rule significantly predicted post-deployment PTSD symptoms (AUC=0.66, 95% CI: 0.53-0.79) with an optimal sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.91. Permutation analysis using random methylation loci supported these findings. Together, these data establish the importance of SKA2 for cortisol stress responsivity and the development of PTSD and provide further evidence that SKA2 is a promising biomarker for stress-related disorders including PTSD.  Results provide novel support for PTSD-related accelerated aging in DNAm and extend the evidence base of known DNAm age correlates to the domains of neural integrity and cognition. We investigated serum DNA methylation patterns in genomic repetitive elements, LINE-1 and Alu, for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases and controls who were US military service members recently deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. In light of its role in glucocorticoid receptor transactivation, we investigated whether SKA2 DNA methylation influences cortisol stress reactivity and is involved in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These results suggest that alterations in global methylation pattern are involved in behavioural adaptation to environmental stress and pinpoint Dlgap2 as a possible target in PTSD. Here we examined whether there was a link between an established rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Bdnf DNA methylation We investigated serum DNA methylation patterns in genomic repetitive elements, LINE-1 and Alu, for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases and controls who were US military service members recently deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq.Cases (n = 75) had a postdeployment diagnosis of PTSD DNA methylation in repetitive elements and post-traumatic stress disorder: a case-control study of US military service members Here we examined whether there was a link between an established rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Bdnf DNA methylation.  DNA methylation in repetitive elements and post-traumatic stress disorder: a case-control study of US military service members. AIM: We investigated serum DNA methylation patterns in genomic repetitive elements, LINE-1 and Alu, for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases and controls who were US military service members recently deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq.  Together, these results suggest that psychosocial stress may alter global and gene-specific DNA methylation patterns potentially associated with peripheral immune dysregulation. DNA methylation in vulnerability to post-traumatic stress in rats: evidence for the role of the post-synaptic density protein Dlgap2. Subjects with PTSD showed a higher DNA methylation of four CpG sites at the BDNF promoter compared with those without PTSD Cumulatively, the data suggest that epigenetic variation at SKA2 mediates vulnerability to suicidal behaviors and PTSD through dysregulation of the HPA axis in response to stress."
Couldn't the Menzerath-Altmann law be proved mathematically trivial in genomes?,no,"Here we review the statistical foundations of that test and consider three non-parametric tests based upon different correlation metrics and one parametric test to evaluate if Z ∼ 1/X in genomes. The most powerful test is a new non-parametric one based upon the correlation ratio, which is able to reject Z ∼ 1/X in nine out of 11 taxonomic groups and detect a borderline group. Rather than a fact, Z ∼ 1/X is a baseline that real genomes do not meet. The view of Menzerath-Altmann law as inevitable is seriously flawed.

The view of Menzerath-Altmann law as inevitable is seriously flawed."
Don't brown fat cells produce heat?,no,"WAT and BAT are both involved in energy balance. WAT is mainly involved in the storage and mobilization of energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas BAT specializes in dissipating energy as heat during cold- or diet-induced thermogenesis. Because brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy in the form of heat, increasing energy expenditure by augmenting BAT-mediated thermogenesis may represent an approach to counter obesity and its complications. Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. This nonshivering thermogenesis is crucial for mammals as a defense against cold and obesity/diabetes. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat cells produces heat by dissipating the energy generated by fatty acid and glucose oxidation. Brown fat biology and thermogenesis. Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat.  Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. Calorimetric measurements from cell suspensions showed that ATP increased basal heat production of isolated brown fat cells by approximately 40% but had no effect on the greater than fivefold increase in heat production seen with maximal adrenergic stimulation. Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or to excessive energy intake; stimulation of brown fat development and function may thus counteract obesity. The occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells that has been revealed in 65 out of the total 180 samples (36%), suggests that the oxidation of fat for the thermogenesis proceeds in the brown fat tissue and that brown fat cells partially undergo fat depletion. Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified ""beige"" or ""brite"" cells are activated by β-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1 The ability of brown adipocytes (fat cells) to dissipate energy as heat shows great promise for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders Inappropriate heat dissipation ignites brown fat thermogenesis in mice with a mutant thyroid hormone receptor α1 Brown fat and vascular heat dissipation: The new cautionary tail Brown adipose produces heat as a defense against hypothermia and obesity, and the appearance of brown-like adipocytes within white adipose tissue depots is associated with improved metabolic phenotypes.  In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers.  Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production.  It is inferred that brown-adipose-tissue heat production is reduced during (and probably also some time after) anesthesia.  Parallel measurements of heat production and thermogenin content in brown fat cells during cold acclimation of rats. The classical white adipose tissue builds up energy in the form of triglycerides and is useful for preventing fatigue during periods of low caloric intake and the brown adipose tissue instead of inducing fat accumulation can produce energy as heat. In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified ""beige"" or ""brite"" cells are activated by β-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1. White adipose tissue stores energy reserves as fat, whereas the metabolic function of brown adipose tissue is lipid oxidation to produce heat. The main function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is to produce heat in response to cold. Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or caloric overfeeding. Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat. Adipose tissue plays an active role in energy balance because it is not only a lipid storing and mobilizing tissue but consists of functionally specialized tissues able to produce heat (in brown adipose tissue) and to produce or release a vast number of so called adipokines or adipocytokines. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), a specialized fat that dissipates energy to produce heat, plays an important role in the regulation of energy balance. Brown adipose cells are specialized to dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat, as a physiological defence against cold and obesity. In the present study, the thermogenesis of human brown fat tissue was suggested chiefly with regard to the occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells. In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers. Adult humans have heat-producing and energy-consuming brown adipose tissue in the clavicular region of the neck. Brown and beige adipocytes expend chemical energy to produce heat and are therefore important in regulating body temperature and body weight. In human perirenal brown fat tissue, darkly stained fat-depleted cells (D) occupy, with other cell types (CR, CR'), an important part in the reversible heat production cycle of the brown fat tissue. Brown fat is a specialized fat depot that can increase energy expenditure and produce heat."
is there an increase in ultrasound comets after intense exercise?,yes,"Healthy athletes developed subclinical increase in pulmonary water content immediately after an Ironman race at sea level, as shown by the increased number of ULCs related to cardiac changes occurring during exercise. Increased EVLW is associated with estimated PCWP and indices of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The additional exercise-induced increase of PCWP, the worsening of left ventricular diastolic function, and extensive wall-motion abnormalities correlate with variations of EVLW.  Among them chest ultrasonography can detect and quantify the extravascular lung water, creating ""comet-tail"" ultrasound artefacts (ULCs) from water-thickened pulmonary interlobular septa.  In top-level breath-hold divers, chest sonography frequently reveals an increased number of ULCs after immersion, indicating a relatively high prevalence of (often subclinical) reversible extravascular lung water accumulation."
Is thyroid hormone therapy indicated in patients with heart failure?,no,"Patients with chronic heart failure and subclinical hypothyroidism significantly improved their physical performance when normal TSH levels were reached. Early and sustained physiological restoration of circulating L-T3 levels after MI halves infarct scar size and prevents the progression towards heart failure. This beneficial effect is likely due to enhanced capillary formation and mitochondrial protection. These data indicate that T(3) replacement to euthyroid levels improves systolic function and tends to improve diastolic function, potentially through changes in myocardial gene expression. In these patients, the administration of synthetic triiodothyronine (T(3)) was well tolerated and induced significant improvement in cardiac function without increased heart rate and metabolic demand. In DC patients, short-term synthetic L-T(3) replacement therapy significantly improved neuroendocrine profile and ventricular performance. Triiodothyronine was well tolerated without episodes of ischemia or clinical arrhythmia. There was no significant change in heart rate or metabolic rate and there was minimal increase in core temperature. Cardiac output increased with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance in patients receiving the largest dose, consistent with a peripheral vasodilatory effect."
Can't DNA intercalators function as topoisomerase inhibitors?,no,"The aporphine alkaloids (+)-dicentrine and (+)-bulbocapnine are non-planar molecules lacking features normally associated with DNA binding by intercalation or minor groove binding. Surprisingly, dicentrine showed significant activity as a topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) inhibitor and also was active in a DNA unwinding assay. The DNA unwinding suggests DNA intercalation, which could explain the inhibition of topoisomerase II. We found that several agents, including adriamycin (a DNA intercalator and inhibitor of topoisomerase II) Amsacrine, a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor, is efficacious as an antileukemogenic agent. Quinacrine was less effective. (ii) Inhibitors intercalating and binding to the 'cleavable' DNA-topoisomerase complex (m-AMSA, mitoxantrone, doxorubicin and daunorubicin) strongly suppressed reparative DNA incision.  DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. To determine whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs Empirical assays consisting of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II.  Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation. Abnormal expression of the nuclear-associated enzyme DNA topoisomerase II (topoisomerase II) has been implicated in the in vitro phenotype of radiation hypersensitive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and in modifying sensitivity of eukaryotic cells to topoisomerase II-inhibitor drugs [e.g., the DNA intercalator amsacrine (mAMSA)].  All three tested anthraquinones, emodin, aloe-emodin, and danthron, showed capabilities to inhibit the non-covalent binding of bisbenzimide Hoechst 33342 to isolated DNA and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells comparable to the topoisomerase II inhibitor and intercalator m-amsacrine. These studies suggest that AD 288 inhibits topoisomerase II activity by preventing the initial non-covalent binding of topoisomerase II to DNA. Since AD 288 is a potent DNA intercalator, catalytic inhibition is achieved by prohibiting access of the enzyme to DNA binding sites.  AQ4N (1,4-bis[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] amino]-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9, 10-dione bis-N-oxide dihydrochloride) is a prodrug which is selectively activated within hypoxic tissues to AQ4, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA intercalator. Amonafide is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.  We found that three compounds had similar cancer cell-selective growth inhibition to amonafide, while retaining similar subcellular localization, DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition activities. Amonafide is a novel topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitor and DNA intercalator that induces apoptotic signaling by blocking the binding of Topo II to DNA. At higher concentrations, inhibition of Top1 catalytic activity and DNA intercalation is observed. Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new oligopyrrole carboxamides linked with tricyclic DNA-intercalators as potential DNA ligands or topoisomerase inhibitors. It was found that 1) morpholinyldoxorubicin, cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, and Actinomycin D (but not doxorubicin) stimulated DNA topoisomerase I-induced cleavage at specific DNA sites; 2) only doxorubicin and Actinomycin D stimulated DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II; 3) at higher drug concentrations, DNA intercalators suppressed enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage induced by DNA topoisomerase I, as well as topoisomerase II; 4) only cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin produced DNA-DNA cross-links; no DNA unwinding could be observed; and 5) DNA intercalation (unwinding) potency of morpholinyldoxorubicin was about 2-fold less than that of doxorubicin. The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I. The screen of cMAP for uncharacterized drugs indicated the signature of Epoxy anthraquinone derivative (EAD) matched the profiles of multiple known DNA targeted agents (topoisomerase I/II inhibitors, DNA intercalators, and DNA alkylation agents) as predicted by its structure. Cytotoxicity of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators is thought to result from disturbance of DNA metabolism following trapping of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. Numerous topoisomerase I poisons including DNA minor groove binders such as Hoechst 33258 and DNA intercalators such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids and indolocarbazole derivatives have been discovered and developed. The stabilization of cleavage intermediates by intercalators may have a common mechanism for DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II. Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Taken together, our results suggest that much of the activity and specificity of m-AMSA as a topoisomerase II poison is embodied in the headgroup, while DNA intercalation is used primarily to increase the affinity of m-AMSA for the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex. The cross-sensitivity patterns of the mutant were examined for covalently (anthramycin) and non-covalently (distamycin A) binding minor groove ligands, and DNA intercalating [adriamycin, mitoxantrone and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA)] and non-intercalating (VP16-213) topoisomerase II poisons. Quinoline alkaloids as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Structure-activity relationships for a series of amiloride analogs. These include: (i) the production of improved topoisomerase inhibitors (by consideration of drug/protein as well as drug/DNA interactions); (ii) the development of reductively-activated chromophores as hypoxia-selective agents; and (iii) the use of DNA-intercalators of known DNA binding orientation as 'carriers' for the delivery of other reactive functionality specifically (sequence-, regio- and site-specifically) to DNA. Indolo[2,3-b]quinolines are a family of DNA intercalators and inhibitors of topoisomerase II, synthetic analogs of neocryptolepine, an alkaloid traditionally used in African folk medicine. Their ability to function as bis-intercalators was assessed by a novel and convenient topoisomerase fluorescent assay. Structure-activity relationship of polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complexes as DNA intercalators, DNA photocleavage reagents, and DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibitors. In addition, fragments of about 900 kbp were detected in the cells treated with a topoisomerase inhibitor, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methane-sulfon-m-anisidine, and fragments in the broad size range between 700 and 245 kbp in the cells treated with radical producers, bleomycin and neocarzinostatin.  The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I.  Long-term inhibition of DNA synthesis and the persistence of trapped topoisomerase II complexes in determining the toxicity of the antitumor DNA intercalators mAMSA and mitoxantrone. Effects of the DNA intercalators 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium on topoisomerase II mediated DNA strand cleavage and strand passage. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks.  Here, molecular interactions of the potent antitumor drug amsacrine (m-AMSA), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, within living K562 cancer cells have been studied using surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy.  It has been shown previously that DNA intercalators can inhibit the action of amsacrine and several other topoisomerase II poisons, presumably as a result of interference with the DNA binding sites for the enzyme.  The gadd153 promoter was strongly activated by a broad spectrum of genotoxic agents including UV-mimetic agents, DNA-cross-linking and alkylating agents, DNA intercalators, and topoisomerase inhibitors.  Our study indicates that Epoxy anthraquinone derivative may be a novel DNA topoisomerase inhibitor that can be potentially used for treatment of neuroblastoma or other cancer patients. Organic intercalators can inhibit nucleic acid synthesis in vivo, and they are now common anticancer drugs in clinical therapy.  Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells. Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. A function for topoisomerases I and II in DNA excision repair can be postulated from the organization of the mammalian chromosome, involving nucleosomal structures and matrix-attached DNA loops. To analyse this function we determined UV-induced DNA incision in confluent human fibroblasts in the presence of 16 inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II which belonged to at least five different drug categories, based on their mechanism of action. In experiments to determine the mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by amiloride, we observed that amiloride inhibited both the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent cell functions in vivo. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. The pyridoacridines&apos; ability to inhibit TOPO II-mediated decatenation of kDNA correlated with their cytotoxic potencies and their ability to intercalate into calf thymus DNA. These results suggest that disruption of the function of TOPO II, subsequent to intercalation, is a probable mechanism by which pyridoacridines inhibit the proliferation of HCT cells. Evidence for DNA intercalation by AD41 is provided by the observation that the drug introduces positive supercoils into covalently closed plasmid DNA. Based on these data, a hypothesis is proposed that would provide a general mechanism whereby intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins alter topoisomerase function and presumably exert their antitumor effects. Therefore, to more fully analyze structure-function relationships and the role of DNA binding in the action of m-AMSA, we analyzed a series of derivatives for the ability to enhance DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ and to intercalate DNA. Results indicate that the 3&apos;-methoxy (m-AMSA) positively affects drug function, potentially by restricting the rotation of the headgroup in a favorable orientation."
Is there a genome-wide technique for the detection of R-loop formation?,yes,"Genome-wide analysis of fragile sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microarray (ChIP-chip) of phosphorylated H2A in these mutants supported a transcription-dependent mechanism of DNA damage characteristic of R loops We have used a bisulfite-sensitivity assay to demonstrate genome-wide increase in the occurrence of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops), including from antisense and read-through transcripts, in a nusG missense mutant defective for Rho-dependent termination. The results demonstrate a key function of FACT in the resolution of R-loop-mediated transcription-replication conflicts, likely associated with a specific chromatin organization. Previous work revealed that GC skew and R-loop formation associate with a core set of unmethylated CpG island (CGI) promoters in the human genome"
Doesn't PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) binds with HDL-receptor (HDL-R)?,yes,"Recently it was revealed that the secreted Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin 9 (PCSK9) binds with LDL-receptor (LDL-R) causing its degradation in the lysosome with the result of LDL-C accumulating in the blood. The major goal of this study is to identify peptide/s from the catalytic domain of hPCSK9 that can block the binding of hPCSK9 and LDL-R and therefore can reduce LDL-R degradation leading to the clearance of LDL-C from the plasma. In vitro administration of SRT3025 to cultured AML12 hepatocytes attenuated Pcsk9 secretion and its binding to Ldlr, thereby reducing Pcsk9-mediated Ldlr degradation and increasing Ldlr expression and LDL uptake. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which involves in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism by interacting with the LDL receptor, is considered as a potent therapeutic target for treating hypercholesterolemia.  Taken together, these results suggested that the IgG1-PA4 can be served as a potential candidate for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting PCSK9-mediated degradation of cell surface LDLRs. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, escorting it to its destruction in the lysosome and thereby preventing the recirculation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor to the hepatocyte cell surface.  However, statins have low efficiency because they also increase PCSK9 which targets LDLR for degradation. Inhibition of the enzyme PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), which is involved in depletion of the LDL-receptor, is a new pharmacologic approach.  Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) modulates LDL-c through post-translational degradation of the LDLR. Mechanistically, hepatic S1P KD was shown to decrease the liver and plasma levels of the protein proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which degrades LDLR protein.  We report here the development of sdAbs targeting human PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) as an alternative to anti-PCSK9 mAbs. PCSK9 proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK9) protein plays an important role in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism, due to its role in the degradation of the LDL receptor. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptors, leading to their degradation Low density lipoprotein binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) in human plasma and inhibits PCSK9-mediated low density lipoprotein receptor degradation Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like-A domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and mediates LDLR degradation in liver Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds LDL receptors, targeting them for degradation Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which binds the low-density lipoprotein receptor and targets it for degradation, has emerged as an important regulator of serum cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease risk Secreted proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) at the cell surface and disrupts the normal recycling of the LDLR Proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key regulator of plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) and cardiovascular risk, is produced in liver and secreted into plasma where it binds hepatic LDL receptors (LDLR), leading to their degradation Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and is therefore a prominent therapeutic target for reducing LDL-cholesterol In the present study we scanned the related gene of a clinically diagnosed autosomal genetic hypercholesterolemia family for the possible mutations and established eukaryotic expression vector of mutation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene with gene recombination technique to investigate the contributions of the variation on low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) metabolism and function alternation.Mutation detection was conducted for LDL-R, apolipoprotein B(100) (apoB(100)) and PCSK9 gene with nucleotide sequencing in a Chinese FH family Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) provides a key step in LDL metabolism by stimulating LDL receptor degradation. The proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) pathway plays a key role in lipoprotein metabolism by promoting LDL-receptor degradation. Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a key role in LDL receptor processing. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLr) in hepatocytes, and its expression in mouse liver has been shown to decrease with fenofibrate treatment.We developed a sandwich ELISA using recombinant human PCSK9 protein and 2 affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against human PCSK9. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enhances the degradation of the LDLR and modulates liver CD81 levels. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism is governed by proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which down-regulates LDL receptor expression, resulting in higher LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is gaining attention as a key regulator of serum LDL-cholesterol (LDLC). The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene regulates cholesterol homoeostasis by accelerating low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation resulting in the decreased catabolism of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leading to hypercholesterolaemia. Low density lipoprotein binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) in human plasma and inhibits PCSK9-mediated low density lipoprotein receptor degradation. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like-A domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and mediates LDLR degradation in liver. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a regulator of LDL-cholesterol receptor homeostasis and emerges as a therapeutic target in the prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease. The present study was conducted to investigate the role of plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels, a regulator of LDL-receptor expression, in the occurrence of diabetic dyslipidemia."

TNNI3K is highly expressed in heart, but is undetectable in other tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis predominantly localized TNNI3K in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes."
Isn't the Dictyostelium discoideum proteome known?,no,"The Negative Proteome Database (NPD) is populated with pair-wise protein sequence comparisons between each of the following proteomes: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium discoideum, Chlamydomonus reinhardti, Escherichia coli K12, Arabidopsis thaliana and Methanoscarcina acetivorans. The Dictyostelium discoideum proteome--the SWISS-2DPAGE database of the multicellular aggregate (slug). Consequently, this genomic sequence information can now be exploited to realize D. discoideum proteomics projects.  The Dictyostelium discoideum genome has been sequenced, assembled and annotated to a high degree of reliability. The parts-list of proteins and RNA encoded by the six chromosomes can now be accessed and analyzed.  The 34 Mb genome of Dictyostelium discoideum is carried on 6 chromosomes and has been fully sequenced by an international consortium. The sequence was assembled on the classical and physical maps that had been built up over the years and refined by HAPPY mapping. Annotation of the sequence predicted about 12,000 genes for proteins of at least 50 amino acids in length. In this study, a quantitative comparative proteomics approach has been used to analyze the Dictyostelium discoideum mitochondrial proteome variations during vegetative growth, starvation and the early stages of development.  The secreted proteome profile of developing Dictyostelium discoideum cells. The present repertoire validates our purification method and paves the way for a future proteomics approach to study the dynamics of macropinocytosis.

Aren't mouse chromosomes acrocentric?,no,"Based on combined fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage mapping, the gene order on CFA9 is similar to that of the homologous genes on HSA17q and mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), but in the dog the gene order is inverted with respect to the centromere.  In murine models of human carcinogenesis, however, karyotype analysis is technically demanding because mouse chromosomes are acrocentric and of similar size. The minor satellite is closer to the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes than the major satellite  These cells contain Robertsonian translocated chromosomes 1 and 7 as the only submetacentric chromosome in an otherwise acrocentric genome.  The resulting metacentric chromosomes are very different in size and in morphology from normal mouse acrocentric chromosomes.  Because of 35 independent primary hybrids used in this study were derived from two types of feral mice, each with a different combination of Robertsonian translocation chromosomes, as well as from mice with a normal complement of acrocentric chromosomes, analysis of 16 selected mouse enzyme markers provided data on the segregation of all 20 mouse chromosomes in these hybrids The two mouse stocks exhibit karyotypes consisting of nine pairs of metacentric chromosomes as a result of centric fusions of acrocentric chromosomes in different combinations. Physical gene mapping by in situ hybridization is a difficult task in an all-acrocentric mouse karyotype, because all of the chromosomes are morphologically very similar. The resulting metacentric chromosomes are very different in size and in morphology from normal mouse acrocentric chromosomes. murine models of human carcinogenesis are exceedingly valuable tools to understand genetic mechanisms of neoplastic growth the identification of recurrent chromosomal rearrangements by cytogenetic techniques serves as an initial screening test for tumour specific aberrations in murine models of human carcinogenesis however karyotype analysis is technically demanding because mouse chromosomes are acrocentric and of similar size fluorescence in situ hybridization fish with mouse chromosome specific painting probes can complement conventional banding analysis although sensitive and specific fish analyses are restricted to the visualization of only a few mouse chromosomes at a time here we apply a novel imaging technique that we developed recently for the visualization of human chromosomes to the simultaneous discernment of all mouse chromosomes the approach is based on spectral imaging to measure chromosome specific spectra after fish with differentially labelled mouse chromosome painting probes utilizing a combination of fourier spectroscopy ccd imaging and conventional optical microscopy spectral imaging allows simultaneous measurement of the fluorescence emission spectrum at all sample points a spectrum based classification algorithm has been adapted to karyotype mouse chromosomes we have applied spectral karyotyping sky to chemically induced plasmocytomas mammary gland tumours from transgenic mice overexpressing the c myc oncogene and thymomas from mice deficient for the ataxia telangiectasia atm gene results from these analyses demonstrate the potential of sky to identify complex chromosomal aberrations in mouse models of human carcinogenesis."
Isn't the microRNA 132 (miR-132) involved in brain pathologies?,no,"miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia. micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus. These data are consistent with the idea that altered micro-RNA-mediated processing of messenger RNA populations may contribute to atypical mRNA abundance and neural dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease brain. Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases. Expression of key neuronal microRNAs-including mir-9/9*, mir-124 and mir-132-is repressed in the brains of human HD patients and mouse models. To determine if production of miR-132 is regulated by neuronal activity its expression in mouse brain was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Expression levels of primary and mature-miR-132 increased significantly between postnatal Days 10 and 24. We conclude that miR-132 is an activity-dependent microRNA in vivo, and may contribute to the long-lasting proteomic changes required for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. We investigated how prior seizure preconditioning affects the miRNA response to status epilepticus evoked by intra-amygdalar kainic acid in mice. Increased miR-132 levels were matched with increased binding to Argonaute-2, a constituent of the RNA-induced silencing complex. In tolerant animals, expression responses of >40% of the injury-group-detected miRNAs differed, being either unchanged relative to control or down-regulated, and this included miR-132. In vivo microinjection of locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotides (antagomirs) against miR-132 depleted hippocampal miR-132 levels and reduced seizure-induced neuronal death. Thus, our data strongly suggest that miRNAs are important regulators of seizure-induced neuronal death. Preconditioning describes the ischemic stimulus that triggers an endogenous, neuroprotective response that protects the brain during a subsequent severe ischemic injury, a phenomenon known as 'tolerance'. Downregulation of miR-132 is consistent with our finding that preconditioning ischemia induces a rapid increase in MeCP2 protein, but not mRNA, in mouse cortex. These studies reveal that ischemic preconditioning regulates expression of miRNAs and their predicted targets in mouse brain cortex, and further suggest that miRNAs and MeCP2 could serve as effectors of ischemic preconditioning-induced tolerance. Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD. Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice. transgenic HD mice have abnormal miRNA biogenesis. This information should aid in future studies on therapeutic application of miRNAs in HD. miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies. reports of microRNA (miR) modulators of both neuronal and immune processes (here termed NeurimmiRs) predict therapeutic potential for manipulating NeurimmiR levels in diseases affecting both the immune system and higher brain functions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and anxiety-related disorders. In our opinion, NeurimmiRs that function within both the nervous and the immune systems, such as miR-132 and miR-124, may act as 'negotiators' between these two interacting compartments."
Isn't CD84 genetically associated with arthritis?,no,"The SNP is predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding site motifs in the 3' UTR of an immune-related gene, CD84, and the allele associated with better response to etanercept was associated with higher CD84 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P = 1 × 10(-11) in 228 non-RA patients and P = 0.004 in 132 RA patients) Our study demonstrates that an allele associated with response to etanercept therapy is also associated with CD84 gene expression, and further that CD84 expression correlates with disease activity  Three members of this gene family, Ly108, Ly9, and CD84, exhibit polymorphisms that strongly influence susceptibility to systemic autoimmunity, notably in mice, but also in some human populations"
Is there a phylogenetic analysis for HIV?,yes,"The results of Burst and phylogenetic analysis suggested that the C. neoformans var. grubii strains could be separated into three nonredundant evolutionary groups (Burst group 1 to group 3).  Phylogenetic trees were constructed to evaluate the relationships between the variants We analyzed pol (protease/reverse transcriptase) sequences from 135 newly diagnosed HIV-1-infected patients during the years 2009-2011. For phylogenetic relationships, sequences were aligned to the most recent reference data set from the Los Alamos database using BioEdit (version 7.1.3). The resulting alignment was analyzed with the Phylip package (version 3.67) building a neighbor-joining tree based on the Kimura two-parameter substitution model . Phylogenetic analysis of gag gene were then performed using the MEGA 3.1 software, the gene distances were calculated by Distance program. There were three different HIV-1 subtypes including B, CRF01-AE and CRF07-BC present among twenty four MSMs in Zhengzhou Phylogenetic analysis showed interpatient and intrapatient clustering of LTR nucleotide sequences.  We evaluated the risk factors for intrafamilial transmission of HIV-1 infection through qualitative epidemiology following pol and env gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the Siberian 10.RU.6637 isolate displays the highest sequence identity to the HIV-1 subtype AG forms circulating in Uzbekistan Phylogenetic analysis showed that the evolutionary relationship of Env between HIV and SIV was the closest and they appeared to descend from a common ancestor, and the relationship of HIV and EIAV was the furthest DI was confirmed when maximum sequence divergence was excessive and supported by phylogenetic analysis  (HIV-1) dual infection (DI) has been associated with decreased CD4 T-cell counts and increased viral loads; however, the frequency of intrasubtype DI is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of HIV-1 subtype C strains from Bangladesh and related strains from other countries, and thereby clarify when and from where subtype C was introduced in the country and how it subsequently spread within Bangladesh  This study characterized HCV genotype 5 sequences from South Africa, including six near full-length genomes, as well as the E1 region from an additional 12 genotype 5 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of these near full-length genome sequences revealed that all genotype 5 sequences formed a close cluster with high bootstrap support  The evolutionary history of the B subregion was not as clear as the C subregion, as the short length of this region yielded poor phylogenetic results  Finally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to elucidate the observed pattern of HIV TDR"
Is Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma usually a malignant tumor?,no,"Mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (MHL) is a benign and rare hepatic lesion,  Mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (MHL) is an uncommon benign hepatic tumor typically affecting children under 2 years of age This review on the pathology of hepatic tumors in childhood, from a personal series of 245 tumors, focuses on incidence, management, description of frequent tumors such as hepatoblastoma, fibrolamellar carcinoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma for malignant tumors, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma, and mesenchymal hamartoma for benign tumors.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,yes,"Intraperitoneal or central injection of 3-T(1)AM or T(0)AM into mice, rats, or Djungarian hamsters caused various prompt effects, such as metabolic depression, hypothermia, negative chronotropy, negative inotropy, hyperglycemia, reduction of the respiratory quotient, ketonuria, and reduction of fat mass."
Does DDX54 play a role in DNA damage response?,yes,"DDX54 regulates transcriptome dynamics during DNA damage response. The contribution of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks to the DNA damage response (DDR) has not been extensively studied. Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)+RNA in IR-exposed cells. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts. Because DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR, its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies. Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs."
Does Rad9 interact with Aft1 in S.cerevisiae?,yes,"Rad9 interacts with Aft1 to facilitate genome surveillance in fragile genomic sites under non-DNA damage-inducing conditions in S. cerevisiae. Here we show that Rad9 checkpoint protein, known to mediate the damage signal from upstream to downstream essential kinases, interacts with Aft1 transcription factor in the budding yeast. Aft1 regulates iron homeostasis and is also involved in genome integrity having additional iron-independent functions. Using genome-wide expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, we found Rad9 to be recruited to 16% of the yeast genes, often related to cellular growth and metabolism, while affecting the transcription of ∼2% of the coding genome in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. Importantly, Rad9 is recruited to fragile genomic regions (transcriptionally active, GC rich, centromeres, meiotic recombination hotspots and retrotransposons) non-randomly and in an Aft1-dependent manner. Further analyses revealed substantial genome-wide parallels between Rad9 binding patterns to the genome and major activating histone marks, such as H3K36me, H3K79me and H3K4me. Thus, our findings suggest that Rad9 functions together with Aft1 on DNA damage-prone chromatin to facilitate genome surveillance, thereby ensuring rapid and effective response to possible DNA damage events.

Isn't triadin involved in cardiac function?,no,"Junctin (JCN), a 26-kd sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein, forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin in the SR lumen of cardiac muscle. Within this complex, calsequestrin, triadin, and JCN appear to be critical for normal regulation of ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium (Ca) release. Recent studies have uncovered functional roles of both JCN and triadin in the mouse heart, using transgenic overexpression strategies, which exhibit varying phenotypes including mild SR structural alterations, prolongation of Ca transient decay, impaired relaxation, and cardiac hypertrophy and/or heart failure. Triadin is involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.  Thus the maintenance of triadin expression is essential for normal SR Ca cycling and contractile function. Ca2+ release from the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is regulated by a complex of proteins, including the ryanodine receptor (RyR), calsequestrin (CSQ), junctin (JCN), and triadin 1 (TRD). Impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release has been suggested to contribute to the depressed cardiac function in heart failure. The release of Ca from the SR may be regulated by the ryanodine receptor, triadin, junctin, calsequestrin, and a histidine-rich, Ca-binding protein (HRC)."
Is DNA methylation an epigenetic modification of chromatin related to gene expression?,yes,"DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA involved in the regulation of gene expression by controlling the access to the DNA sequence.  Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation play important biological roles in gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation during development. DNA methylation patterns are characterized by highly conserved developmental programs, but allow for divergent gene expression resulting from stochastic epigenetic drift or divergent environments. DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression.  Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone methylation and acetylation alter gene expression at the level of transcription by upregulating, downregulating, or silencing genes completely. Dysregulation of epigenetic events can be pathological, leading to cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, metabolic disorders, and cancer development. DNA methylation is a pervasive epigenetic DNA modification that strongly affects chromatin regulation and gene expression. Epigenetic control, which includes DNA methylation and histone modifications, leads to chromatin remodeling and regulated gene expression. Epigenetic modifications on the DNA sequence (DNA methylation) or on chromatin-associated proteins (i.e., histones) comprise the ""cellular epigenome""; together these modifications play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Epigenetics is a process involved in gene regulation, mediated via DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and functional noncoding RNAs, which influences the accessibility of the underlying DNA to transcriptional regulatory factors that activate or repress expression. Significant progress has been made in the basic understanding of how various epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, miRNA expression, and higher order chromatin structure affect gene expression."
Isn't gastro esophageal reflux related to burning mouth syndrome?,yes,"Our results suggest that there is no causal connection between LPR episodes and the occurrence of intraoral burning sensations in the examined patients. As reported below, although this symptom may well be diagnostically misleading, careful diagnosis based on clinical signs may distinguish patients with BMS from those with reflux disease, and successful management of burning mouth is often enables."
Is there any link between CTF4 and CTF18 during sister chromatid cohesion?,yes,"Our results suggest that Elg1, Ctf4, and Ctf18 may coordinate the relative movement of the replication fork with respect to the cohesin ring These data defined two cohesion pathways, one containing CSM3, TOF1, CTF4, and CHL1, and the second containing MRC1, CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding. This provides evidence for cohesion establishment in the context of replication forks and imposes constraints on the mechanism involved Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis We also show that, in contrast to mitosis, RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Cft8), Ctf4 and Chl1 are essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis and for the viability of meiotic products. Ctf8p is a component of Ctf18-RFC, an alternative replication factor C-like complex required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We performed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis with a ctf8 deletion strain as a primary screen to identify other nonessential genes required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion. We then assessed proficiency of cohesion at three chromosomal loci in strains containing deletions of the genes identified in the ctf8 SGA screen. Deletion of seven genes (CHL1, CSM3, BIM1, KAR3, TOF1, CTF4, and VIK1) resulted in defective sister chromatid cohesion Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion CTF4 and CTF18 are required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation. Both exhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II. Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 and the pathway involving the acetylation of Smc3. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks.

Is physical performance influenced by thyroid hormone metabolism?,yes,"Longitudinal analysis showed that in Eut men higher baseline FT4 was significantly (p = 0.02) predictive of a lower SPPB score at the 3-year follow-up Even a modest thyroid hormone excess is associated with a reduced physical function in elderly men. Oral L-thyroxine treatment was started and at a 1-month follow-up examination, mental status and physical performance were improved In a population of independently living elderly men, higher FT4 and rT3 concentrations are associated with a lower physical function She had generalised weakness of muscles, cold intolerance and a reduced physical performance. Replacement therapy by oral administration of L-thyroxin resulted in a gradual improvement of the patient's state multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an independent predictor of VO2max changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial functional status in patients with heart failure. THR among patients with SCH is beneficial not only by improvement in lipid profile, as well as by improvement in cognitive and functional status, CONCLUSIONS: Even a modest thyroid hormone excess is associated with a reduced physical function in elderly men. Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) may be responsible for many cardiovascular changes, including an impaired exercise performance. BACKGROUND: Physiological changes in thyroid hormone concentrations might be related to changes in the overall physical function in the elderly."
Aren't the Fanconi anemia genes a part of the same signalling pathway?,no,"Mutations in at least 14 different genes have been shown to cause FA The FA genes code for proteins that act in complexes to coordinate the repair of damaged DNA  The current review describes the structure and function of the Fanconi anemia genes and describes the role of the encoded Fanconi anemia proteins in a cellular pathway controlling chromosome stability. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare human genetic disease caused by mutations in any one of 13 known genes that encode proteins functioning in one common signaling pathway, the FA pathway, or in unknown genes. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited recessive disease caused by mutations in one of fifteen genes known to encode FA pathway components. Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins function in a DNA damage response pathway that appears to be part of the network including breast cancer susceptibility gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Isn't butterfly rash a symptom of Systemic lupus erythematosus?,no,"Diagnosing SLE can be challenging because of the myriad of clinical features and substantial variability between patients. Cutaneous involvement is present in about 60% of cases and typically manifests as a malar or butterfly rash. The prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is 28 per 100,000.  We report a 12 years old female patient with an overlap syndrome involving autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient presented with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, malaise, polyarthralgia, arthritis and butterfly rash on the face. Some of the clinical characteristics of SLE patients observed were nephritis (53.7%), fever (53.26%), neuropsychological disorder (36.18%), malar/butterfly rash (27.6%), pulmonary disorder (22.6%), photosensitivity (21.6%), cardiac involvement (21.1%) and oral ulcers (19.09%).  Systemic lupus erythematosus and infections: a retrospective study in Saudis. The prevalence of the following manifestations was significantly higher for pediatric than for adult-onset disease including: lupus nephritis (43% pediatric vs 26.4% for adult-onset), hematological disorders (57% vs 36.4%), photosensitivity (20% vs 9%), butterfly rash (61% vs 35.5%) and mucosal ulceration (11.4% vs 4%).  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease with highest prevalence among women of childbearing age.  We described a unique case of a 25-year-old Arab young woman who was diagnosed with SLE, depending on clinical, laboratory investigations and after she had fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for SLE and had presented the following findings: constitutional findings (fatigue, fever, and arthralgia); dermatologic finding (photosensitivity and butterfly rash); chronic renal failure (proteinuria up to 400 mg in 24 hours); hematologic and antinuclear antibodies (positivity for antinuclear factor (ANF), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, direct Coombs, ANA and anti-DNA, low C4 and C3, aCL by IgG and IgM).  Grade 1 and 2-3 inflammatory process occurred in 53 (63%) and 31 (37%) patients respectively. Symptom complexes ""systemic inflammation"", ""butterfly rash"", ""wrist petechiae"", ""enanthema of the oral mucous membrane"", and other lesions were regarded as the markers of SLE activity.  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains a challenging medical problem.  Rembrandt's Maria Bockenolle has a butterfly rash and digital deformities: overlapping syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. A butterfly rash on the patient's face suggested a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A butterfly rash on the patients face suggested a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) The diagnosis of SLE could be excluded and the butterfly rash attributed to a laminar hemorrhage, an ecchymosis due to the autoimmune thrombocytopenia. We describe a case of KD who developed a typical butterfly rash, reminiscent of SLE.  The diagnosis of SLE was made 22 years ago based on Raynaud's phenomenon, butterfly rash, hair loss, photosensitivity and positive antinuclear antibody.  Symptom complexes ""systemic inflammation"", ""butterfly rash"", ""wrist petechiae"", ""enanthema of the oral mucous membrane"", and other lesions were regarded as the markers of SLE activity. Rembrandt's Maria Bockenolle has a butterfly rash and digital deformities: overlapping syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. To investigate, various unspecific, but otherwise typical clinical symptoms of skin and mucous membranes that arise in SLE patients other than those defined as SLE criteria such as butterfly rash, chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, oral ulcers, and increased photosensitivity."
Isn't curcumin a phytochemical?,no,"we analyzed turmeric from different agroclimatic regions for influence of various factors on its growth and yield of important phytochemicals The phytochemical, curcumin, has been reported to play many beneficial roles. Curcumin (CUR), the major component in Curcuma longa, has been shown as a potent chemopreventive phytochemical that modulates various signaling pathways.  Curcumin (CUR) is a phytochemical that inhibits the xenobiotic ABC efflux transporters implicated in cancer multidrug resistance (MDR), such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins 1 and 5 (MRP1 and MRP5).

Is cilengitide effective for treatment of glioblastoma?,no,"RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). However, we could not conclusively confirm whether cilengitide 2000mg/5/week was the optimum regime, as only one trial using this protocol was included in our study. Cilengitide (CGT) is a cyclic pentapeptide that demonstrated efficacy for GBM treatment by targeting the integrins avβ3 and avβ5 over-expressed on GBM cells. Cilengitide is recently failed in Phase III CENTRIC trial in unselected patients with GBM. In conclusion, we demonstrate that EGFRvIII/integrin β3 complexes promote GBM progression and metastasis in the environment of hypoxia and vitronectin-enrichment, and cilengitide may serve as a promising therapeutics for EGFRvIII-positive GBMs. he addition of molecularly targeted drugs to TEM + RAD did not improve the OS of patients with GBM; however, it did improve PFS in patients treated by cilengitide who could not get improvement in OS.   The randomized phase III CENTRIC and phase II CORE trials explored the integrin inhibitor cilengitide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with versus without O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. These trials failed to meet their primary endpoints . In CORE, higher αvβ3 levels in tumor cells were associated with improved progression-free survival by central review and with improved overall survival in patients treated with cilengitide. Cilengitide combined with metronomic temozolomide and procarbazine in MGMT-promoter unmethylated glioblastoma did not improve survival compared with historical data and does not warrant further investigation. The addition of cilengitide to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy did not improve outcomes; cilengitide will not be further developed as an anticancer drug. Cilengitide treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients does not alter patterns of progression. It may be proposed that the combination therapy of NG2 suppression and cilengitide treatment showed no considerable effect on glioblastoma compared to cilengitide therapy alone."

Can CD55 deficiency cause thrombosis?,yes,"The loss of CD55 and CD59 renders PNH erythrocytes susceptible to intravascular haemolysis, which can lead to thrombosis and to much of the morbidity and mortality of PNH.  CD55 Deficiency, Early-Onset Protein-Losing Enteropathy, and Thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.  It is caused by the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene that results in deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor structure responsible for fixing a wide spectrum of proteins particularly CD55 and CD59. The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. The lack of one of the GPI-AP complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) leads to hemolysis. The disease is diagnosed with hemolytic anemia, marrow failure and thrombosis. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder that manifests with hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood cytopenias. The absence of two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, CD55 and CD59, leads to uncontrolled complement activation that accounts for hemolysis and other PNH manifestations. RESULTS: CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1.6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1.0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4.7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT. Data of this study indicate that the PNH defect as detected with CD55, CD59, and CD16 is not an important cause of intra-abdominal thrombosis in northwestern India. PNH testing of red blood cells revealed a CD55 and CD59 deficiency consistent with PNH in both cases. The systemic complications typically associated with thrombosis were not observed for the following several months with early conservative treatments including eculizumab. Deficiency of the GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation. Apart from hemolysis, another prominent feature is a highly increased risk of thrombosis. Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder characterized by a decrease or absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules such as CD55 and CD59 from the surface of affected cells, resulting in intravascular hemolysis, cytopenia, and venous thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.

Aren't hepadnaviral minichromosomes free of nucleosomes?,yes,"Several nucleosome-protected sites in a region of the DHBV genome [nucleotides (nt) 2000 to 2700], known to harbor various cis transcription regulatory elements, were consistently identified in all DHBV-positive liver samples. In addition, we observed other nucleosome protection sites in DHBV minichromosomes that may vary among individual ducks, but the pattern of MNase mapping in those regions is transmittable from the adult ducks to the newly infected ducklings. nucleosomes along viral cccDNA in the minichromosomes are not random but sequence-specifically positioned. Investigators studying the structure and function of hepadnaviral CCC DNA (3) have provided evidence that suggests that this structure exists in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes as a heterogeneous population of viral minichromosomes, which range from half to fully chromatinized, thought to be owing to their association with variable numbers of nucleosomes. Characterization of nucleosome positioning in hepadnaviral covalently closed circular DNA minichromosomes. To obtain insight on the structure of hepadnaviral cccDNA minichromosomes, we utilized ducks infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) as a model and determined the in vivo nucleosome distribution pattern on viral cccDNA by the micrococcal nuclease (MNase) mapping and genome-wide PCR amplification of isolated mononucleosomal DHBV DNA. Mature SV40 minichromosomes are estimated to contain about 27 nucleosomes (error +/- 2), except for those molecules with a nucleosome-free gap, which are interpreted to contain 25 nucleosomes (error +/- 2). In vitro replication in the presence of protein-free competitor DNA shows that replicating trypsinized minichromosomes do not lose nucleosomes and replicating competitor DNA does not gain nucleosomes. In vitro replication in the presence of protein-free competitor DNA shows that replicating trypsinized minichromosomes do not lose nucleosomes and replicating competitor DNA does not gain nucleosomes. We conclude that in both cases parental nucleosomes are transferred to progeny DNA, and, in addition, that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurs during the replication of native minichromosomes. In contrast, the replicated untreated minichromosomes were found to be densely packed with nucleosomes, indicating that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurred during in vitro replication.

Does replication timing affect the rate of somatic mutations?,yes,"Here we observe that mutation rate, as reflected in recent evolutionary divergence and human nucleotide diversity, is markedly increased in later-replicating regions of the human genome ll classes of substitutions are affected, suggesting a generalized mechanism involving replication time-dependent DNA damage We show that mutation rate varies 6-fold across a single chromosome, that this variation is correlated with replication timing, and we propose a model to explain this variation that relies on the temporal separation of two processes for replicating past damaged DNA: error-free DNA damage tolerance and translesion synthesis. Recent studies revealed a long suspected replication-timing effect on mutation rate, but the mechanisms that regulate the increase in mutation rate as the genome is replicated remain unclear.  DNA repair systems, in general, are less efficient in late replicating heterochromatic regions compared to early replicating euchromatic regions of the genome. The mutational profile of the yeast genome is shaped by replication the mutation rate increases with the replication timing by more than 30% between the earliest and the latest replicating regions. Thus, we show that the leading replicating strands present an excess of C over G and of A over T in the genome of S. cerevisiae (reciprocally an excess of G + T over C + A in lagging strands) Late-replicating domains have higher divergence and diversity in Drosophila melanogaster Recent evidence also suggests that late replication is associated with high mutability in yeast. Limited evidence from one chromosome arm in Drosophila melanogaster suggests the opposite pattern, with regions overlapping early-firing origins showing increased levels of diversity and divergence The mutation rate for DNA mismatch repair null strains was approximately 1 mutation per genome per generation, 225-fold greater than the wild-type rate. The mutations were distributed randomly throughout the genome, independent of replication timing. Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors in DNA replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified. Here we propose that DNA replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and cancer genomes Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves In addition, certain chromosome rearrangements found in cancer cells and in cells exposed to ionizing radiation display a significant delay in replication timing of >3 hours that affects the entire chromosome(2,3). Recent work from our lab indicates that disruption of discrete cis-acting autosomal loci result in an extremely late replicating phenotype that affects the entire chromosome(4). A conservative estimate is that at least 1-2% of new deleterious mutations affect some aspect of DNA replication, repair, or chromosome segregation. Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. Drake calculates that lytic RNA viruses display spontaneous mutation rates of approximately one per genome while most have mutation rates that are approximately 0.1 per genome (Drake 1993). This constancy of germline mutation rates among microbial species need not necessarily mean constancy of the somatic mutation rates. A recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (RT) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer. DNA replication timing, genome stability and cancer: late and/or delayed DNA replication timing is associated with increased genomic instability. Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. In addition, this method allows for the unambiguous identification of chromosomal rearrangements that correlate with changes in replication timing that affect the entire chromosome."
Doesn't thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling ?,no,"Thyroid hormones exert important effects on heart remodeling through mir-208. RV and RA function and mechanics are significantly affected by SHT. l-T4 therapy and 1-year maintenance of euthyroid status improved but did not completely recover RV and RA function and deformation in the SHT patients, which implies that right heart remodeling caused by SHT is not reversible in a 1-year period. These results suggest that long-term T4 treatment after MI has beneficial effects on myocyte, arteriolar, and collagen matrix remodeling in the non-infarcted area. Most importantly, results suggest improved survival of myocytes in the peri-infarct area."
Isn't cystatin C or cystatin 3 used as a biomarker of kidney function?,no,"to explore the effect of ageing on renal function with cystatin C as the marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the general population without vascular disease or diabetes. Cystatin C, a more specific kidney function biomarker, was also elevated at 24 h after CLP. This study evaluated FGF-23 as well as traditional markers of kidney disease, namely urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and creatinine-cystatin C estimated GFR (eGFRCrCyC), as risk factors for AKI in elderly individuals.  he primary predictor was estimated GFR (eGFR) calculated using serum cystatin C (eGFR(cys)). A number of recent reports have suggested that the cystatin C/creatinine (CysC/Cr) ratio might be a useful biomarker of renal function in pediatric patients. The CKD-EPI equation using cystatin C was the most precise method of renal function evaluation in patients with neurogenic bladder. Serum cystatin C (CysC) is an endogenous marker of kidney function. The urinary content of CysC reflects tubular epithelial dysfunction whereas that of NGAL also characterizes tubular atrophy. Estimated kidney function based on serum cystatin C  : Several formulas for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation, based on serum creatinine or cystatin C, have been proposed.  he highest and lowest eGFR levels corresponded to the cystatin C-based and MDRD-4 equations, respectively.  The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) recently proposed an equation to estimate GFR in subjects without cirrhosis using both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels. Emerging evidence has shown that cystatin C may improve classification of glomerular filtration rate for defining chronic kidney disease in certain clinical populations and assist in understanding the complications of chronic kidney disease Beta-trace protein (BTP) and cystatin C (CysC) are novel biomarkers of renal function.  Cystatin C could improve chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification in HIV-infected women relative to serum creatinine.  Iohexol clearance and cystatin C formulae identify a greater proportion of patients with a GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), which also predicts the development of AKI.  Cystatin C was recently reported to be an endogenous surrogate of kidney function, and a high level of cystatin C is reported to be a strong predictor of CVD; Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer ones such as cystatin C or β-trace protein)"

Aren't ultraconserved elements depleted among copy number variants (CNVs)?,no,"We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. Here, we report that nonexonic UCEs are also depleted among 10 of 11 recent genomewide data sets of human CNVs, including 3 obtained with strategies permitting greater precision in determining the extents of CNVs Interestingly, human UCEs have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs) We propose that these elements may be interpreted as hallmarks for dose-sensitive genes, particularly for those genes whose gain or loss may be directly implied in neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, their presence in genomic imbalances of unknown effect might be suggestive of a clinically relevant condition Mammalian ultraconserved elements are strongly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants.

Can't exosomes be detected in urine?,no,"Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted into the extracellular environment upon internal vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. The molecular content of exosomes is a fingerprint of the releasing cell type and of its status. For this reason, and because they are released in easily accessible body fluids such as blood and urine, they represent a precious biomedical tool.  Exosomes are vesicles that are released from the kidney into urine. Quantification of human urinary exosomes by nanoparticle tracking analysis.

Isn't airplane stroke syndrome a common disease.,yes,"Only 37 cases of stroke during or soon after long-haul flights have been published to our knowledge.

Is rivaroxaban metabolized in kidneys?,yes,"The novel oral anticoagulants (i.e., dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban) all undergo renal metabolism to varying degrees, and hence dosing, efficacy, and safety require special consideration in CKD patients. The new oral anticoagulants have relatively little data in patients with severe renal impairment, and all have an element of renal excretion. Now new anticoagulant drugs(dabigatran and rivaroxaban) can become available. Therefore, we have to learn how to use those drugs. They have to carefully be used because they discharge from kidney and old aged patients have potential renal dysfunction.  In the everyday practice it will be necessary to be very cautious in patients with impaired renal function, as all these drugs are eliminated by kidneys. Dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban carry the highest risk due to a high degree of renal excretion, whereas the risk for apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban seems lower. However, all these agents undergo renal clearance to varying degrees, and hence dosing, efficacy, and safety require special consideration in patients with CKD.  Rivaroxaban being excreted via kidney and liver, some precautions should apply in case of liver insufficiency.  Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by hepatic metabolism."
Does cortical spreading depression appear in ischemic penumbra following ischemic stroke?,yes,"During the subacute phase, the irreversible damage expands into the penumbra: multiple electrical and biological signals are triggered by periinfarct, spreading depression-like depolarizations leading to hypoxia and stepwise increase in lactate. Experimental and clinical studies indicate that waves of cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) appearing in the ischemic penumbra contribute to secondary lesion growth. Analysis of MCA occlusions (MCAOs) revealed a first CSD wave starting off during ischemic decline at the emerging core region, propagating concentrically over large portions of left cortex. Subsequent recurrent waves of CSD did not propagate concentrically but preferentially circled around the ischemic core. In the vicinity of the core region, CSDs were coupled to waves of predominantly vasoconstrictive CBF(LSF) responses, resulting in further decline of CBF in the entire inner penumbra and in expansion of the ischemic core. We conclude that CSDs and corresponding CBF responses follow a defined spatiotemporal order, and contribute to early evolution of ischemic territories. Astrocytes in the metabolically compromised ischemic penumbra-like area showed a long lasting swelling response to spontaneous spreading depolarizations despite rapid dendritic recovery in a photothrombotic occlusion model of focal stroke. Spontaneous spreading depolarizations (SDs) occur in the penumbra surrounding ischemic core. These SDs, often referred to as peri-infarct depolarizations, cause vasoconstriction and recruitment of the penumbra into the ischemic core in the critical first hours after focal ischemic stroke; however, the real-time spatiotemporal dynamics of SD-induced injury to synaptic circuitry in the penumbra remain unknown. We propose that metabolic stress resulting from recurring SDs facilitates acute injury at the level of dendrites and dendritic spines in metabolically compromised tissue, expediting penumbral recruitment into the ischemic core. Although the mechanism remains unknown, SDs show delayed electrophysiological recovery within the ischemic penumbra. Spreading depression-like peri-infarct depolarizations not only characterize but also worsen penumbra conditions in cortical border zones of experimental focal ischemia. We conclude that in focal ischemia, transient peri-infarct depolarizations emerge not only in cortical but also in striatal gray matter, thereby demonstrating the existence of subcortical zones of ischemic penumbra. Spreading depression (SD) has been demonstrated following focal ischemia, and the additional workload imposed by SD on a tissue already compromised by a marked reduction in blood flow may contribute to the evolution of irreversible damage in the ischemic penumbra. While the changes in the glucose-related metabolites persisted during recovery even in anterior portions of the cortex in both groups in the aftermath of the SD, the magnitude of the changes was greater in the penumbra than in the normal cortex. SD appears to impose an equivalent increase in energy demands in control and ischemic brain, but the ability of the penumbra to recover from the insult is compromised. Thus, increasing the energy imbalance in the penumbra after multiple SDs may hasten the deterioration of the energy status of the tissue and eventually contribute to terminal depolarization and cell death, particularly in the penumbra. It is suggested that the limited survival of the penumbra is due to periinfarct depolarizations, which result in repeated episodes of tissue hypoxia, because the increased metabolic workload is not coupled to an adequate increase of collateral blood supply. Transient decreases of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water as measured by fast diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the ischemic border zone are thought to reflect cellular swelling associated with spreading depression. Severely delayed recovery time after spreading depression is thought to represent the ischemic penumbra. One current but controversial hypothesis is that this penumbra tissue often eventually dies because of the metabolic stress imposed by multiple cortical spreading depression (CSD) waves, that is, by ischemic depolarizations. After simulated infarction, the model displays the linear relation between final infarct size and the number of CSD waves traversing the penumbra that has been reported experimentally, although damage with each individual wave progresses nonlinearly with time. These findings support the hypothesis that CSD waves play an important causal role in the death of ischemic penumbra tissue. MCAO also triggers periodic periinfarction depolarizing waves (PIDs) in the ischemic penumbra, the territory of salvage. Here, the effects of SD at reduced flow conditions as encountered in the ischemic penumbra are examined. The experiments illustrate how peri-infarct depolarizations may detrimentally affect the penumbra. In the second series of experiments, periinfarct depolarizations (PIDs) were recorded with an extracellular DC electrode at two locations in the ischemic penumbra for the initial 3 h following MCAO. In vivo two-photon microscopy of green fluorescent protein-expressing neurons in this penumbra-like area at risk revealed that SDs were temporally correlated with rapid (<6 s) dendritic beading."

Does magnesium sulfate improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,no,"CONCLUSION: Patients assigned a higher serum magnesium concentration had a reduced incidence of vasospasm as seen by angiography, but the difference was not statistically significant. Clinically significant outcomes were not different between groups. 158 patients (26·2%) had poor outcome in the magnesium group compared with 151 (25·3%) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1·03, 95% CI 0·85-1·25). Our updated meta-analysis of seven randomised trials involving 2047 patients shows that magnesium is not superior to placebo for reduction of poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (RR 0·96, 95% CI 0·86-1·08). INTERPRETATION: Intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.  There is a tendency in the magnesium group to have better outcomes.  Due to inconsistently reported benefits and the occurrence of side effects, phase II data suggested that intravenous magnesium for SAH provided either no overall net benefit or uncertain trade-offs. Benefit was likewise not supported in the single phase III clinical trial. tatistically significant clinical benefits could not be demonstrated for the other drugs (clazosentan, statins, and magnesium). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence is available to support the use of the triple-H therapy, clazosentan, statins, or magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Magnesium sulfate decreased the rate of cerebral infarction, but not of DCI or poor functional outcome. Regarding outcome, a beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate on outcome can not be ruled out because of sample size limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings do not lend support to a beneficial effect of magnesium sulphate infusion on delayed cerebral infarction. The reduction in DCI and improvement in the clinical outcomes of aneurysmal SAH patients following magnesium sulphate infusion observed in previous pilot studies are not confirmed, although a beneficial effect cannot be ruled out because of sample size limitation. Favorable outcome (Good recovery and moderate disability, as defined by Glasgow Outcome Scale) was achieved in 20 of 30 (67%) patients receiving magnesium sulfate infusion and 16 of 30 (53%) patients receiving placebo treatment, p = 0.292, odds ratio 1.750, 95% CI 0.616-4.974. Similarly, the pooled odds ratio for favorable outcome is 1.598, 95% CI 1.074-2.377, statistically significant.  RESULTS: The worst clinical outcomes at 6 months were seen in MgSO(4) group patients, with mean plasma magnesium concentrations in the fourth quartile, and in placebo group patients, with mean such concentrations in the third and fourth quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to suggest that a higher mean plasma magnesium concentration improves clinical outcomes. On the contrary, we found an association between high plasma magnesium concentration and worse clinical outcomes. The proportions of patients with a favorable outcome at 6 months (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 to 8) were similar, 64% in the magnesium sulfate group and 63% in the saline group (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6). Secondary outcome analyses (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form 36, and clinical vasospasm) also showed no significant differences between the 2 groups.  CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support a clinical benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion over placebo infusion in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnesium infusion reduced the risk of poor outcome and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI): the relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-1.00), respectively.  CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests that intravenous magnesium therapy reduces the risk of DCI and poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH.  The incidence of delayed ischemic infarction was significantly lower in magnesium-treated patients (22% vs. 51%; p = .002); 34 of 54 magnesium patients and 27 of 53 control patients reached good outcome (p = .209). BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit.  These data imply that intravenous magnesium therapy, besides a supposed beneficial effect on outcome, also provides pain relief for SAH patients, for whom it might also improve functional outcome. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  In a phase II randomized clinical trial of 283 patients, magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% and of poor outcome by 23%. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that high-dose MgSO4 therapy is safe and reduces the incidence of DIND and subsequent poor outcome after SAH.  On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after 3 months (P = .017) and a trend toward better outcome after 1 year (P = .083).   CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MgSO4 therapy might be efficient as a prophylactic adjacent therapy after SAH to reduce the risk for poor outcome.  There was no significant difference in mortality rate at discharge (p = 0.328). A trend toward improved outcome as measured by the modifed Rankin Scale (p = 0.084), but not the Glasgow Outcome Scale (p = 1.0), was seen in the MgSO4 treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results suggests that MgSO4 infusion may have a role in cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis if therapy is initiated within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture. There was, however, no difference between groups in functional recovery or Glasgow Outcome Scale score.  Patients receiving MgSO4 tended to have fewer neurological deficits, better functional recovery and an improved score in GOS.  CONCLUSIONS: MgSO4 infusion after aneurysmal SAH is well tolerated and may be useful in producing better outcome. CONCLUSION: Magnesium did not seem to interfere in vasospasm frequency but apparently acted favorably in decreasing morbidity and length of hospital stay. None of the patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients). At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive.  We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level.  Magnesium sulfate treatment improves outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a meta-analysis study. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our results indicate that although there was reduced likelihood of a poor outcome for patients treated with magnesium sulfate after SAH, patient mortality was not improved. CONCLUSION: Administration of intra-arterial magnesium sulfate in combination with nicardipine was well tolerated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm without a significant change in MAP and ICP. Current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit Despite the publication of several randomized controlled studies, there is still much debate on whether magnesium sulfate improves outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Magnesium sulphate is a neuroprotective agent that might improve outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage by reducing the occurrence or improving the outcome of delayed cerebral ischaemia"
Hasn't ATF4 transcription factor been linked to cancer and neoplastic transformation?,no,"aken together, we discovered a novel axis of BCL10-regulated OSCC progression via STAT1/ATF4/S100P/P65 signaling, which could predict the prognosis of OSCC and will be beneficial for developing therapeutic strategy against advanced OSCC s a result, the level of phosphorylated Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) is markedly elevated, resulting in the promotion of a pro-adaptive signaling pathway by the inhibition of global protein synthesis and selective translation of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4).  Many cancers overexpress ATF4, a stress-induced transcription factor that promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions and other stresses of the tumor microenvironment, but the potential contributions of ATF4 to oncogenesis itself have been little explored. Here, we report that ATF4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes.  Here, we report that ATF4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes. Elevated levels of ATF4 were sufficient to suppress expression of these proteins and drive oncogenic transformation. Our findings define a central function for ATF4 in promoting oncogenic transformation by suppressing a central pathway of cellular senescence.<br> ATF4 expression is upregulated in cancer.

Is lambrolizumab effective for treatment of patients with melanoma ?,yes,"However, through parallel efforts that have showcased the efficacy of small-molecule BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, as well as the immune checkpoint inhibitors, namely ipilimumab and the anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies (lambrolizumab, nivolumab, MPDL3280), an opportunity exists to transform the treatment of melanoma specifically and cancer generally by exploring rational combinations of molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and molecular targeted therapies with immunotherapies.  Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)/its ligand (PD-L1) antibodies have changed the landscape in oncology in 2013. The most mature results have been obtained in advanced melanoma patients.  Merck's lambrolizumab (MK-3475) monoclonal antibody received ""Breakthrough Therapy"" designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April for treating patients with advanced melanoma. The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell effector mechanisms that limits immune responses against cancer. We tested the anti-PD-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as MK-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma.  In patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.  Because of all these reasons PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are considered 'drug of the year'."
Aren't there focused databases from which you can retrieve gene expression data on renal disease?,no,Proteomics database in chronic kidney disease Naturally occurring human urinary peptides for use in diagnosis of chronic kidney disease
Can't non ubiquitinated Tomm20 promote mitophagy?,yes,"A total of 338 new targets were identified and from these we validated glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Gsk3β), which can phosphorylate α-synuclein, and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (Tomm20), a mitochondrial translocase that, when ubiquitinated, promotes mitophagy, as SCFFbxo7substrates both in vitro and in vivo Ubiquitin chain restriction analyses revealed that Fbxo7 modified Gsk3β using K63 linkages."
Is there a crystal structure of the full-length of the flaviviridae NS5(Methyltransferase - RNA depended RNA Polymerase) ?,yes,"flavivirus NS5 harbors a methyltransferase (MTase) in its N-terminal ≈ 265 residues and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) within the C-terminal part. One of the major interests and challenges in NS5 is to understand the interplay between RdRP and MTase as a unique natural fusion protein in viral genome replication and cap formation. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus.  (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular domains separated by a 10-residue linker. The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities. The C-terminal domain is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5. It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed. To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the full-length protein. NS5 was found to be monomeric and well-folded under the conditions tested. West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 protein contains a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in RNA capping and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain essential for virus replication. Crystal structures of individual WNV MTase and RdRp domains have been solved; however, the structure of full-length NS5 has not been determined. To gain more insight into the structure of NS5 and interactions between the MTase and RdRp domains, we generated a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the NS5 protein of WNV (Kunjin strain) and mapped their binding sites using a series of truncated NS5 proteins and synthetic peptides. Binding sites of four mAbs (5D4, 4B6, 5C11 and 6A10) were mapped to residues 354-389 in the fingers subdomain of the RdRp. This is consistent with the ability of these mAbs to inhibit RdRp activity in vitro and suggests that this region represents a potential target for RdRp inhibitors. Using a series of synthetic peptides, we also identified a linear epitope (bound by mAb 5H1) that mapped to a 13 aa stretch surrounding residues 47 and 49 in the MTase domain, a region predicted to interact with the palm subdomain of the RdRp. The failure of one mAb (7G6) to bind both N- and C-terminally truncated NS5 recombinants indicates that the antibody recognizes a conformational epitope that requires the presence of residues in both the MTase and RdRp domains."
Are the proteins Erbin (LAP2) and Merlin cooperating?,yes,Erbin and the NF2 tumor suppressor Merlin cooperatively regulate cell-type-specific activation of PAK2 by TGF-beta. The results show that the epithelial-enriched protein Erbin controls the function of the NF2 tumor suppressor Merlin by determining the output of Merlin's physical interactions with active PAK2.  Erbin controls Merlin tumor suppressor function by switching the functional valence of PAK2 binding
Couldn't Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?,no,"Here we refine our approach, and apply it to novel variants found in 2266 patients across two large cohorts with inherited sudden death syndromes, namely catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) or Brugada syndrome (BrS). Calsequestrin-associated catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT2) can cause sudden death in young individuals in response to stress.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disorder characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias induced by physical or emotional stress, in the absence structural heart abnormalities. The arrhythmias may cause syncope or degenerate into cardiac arrest and sudden death which usually occurs during childhood In many cases the cause of death can be elucidated by medico-legal autopsy, however, a significant number of these cases remain unexplained despite a detailed postmortem investigation and are labeled as sudden unexplained death (SUD). Post-mortem genetic testing, so called molecular autopsy, revealed that primary arrhythmogenic disorders including long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) may account for a certain number of these cases. We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryano Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  In conclusion, patients with CASQ2-associated CPVT should be recommended to receive ICDs to prevent sudden death when medical therapy is not effective.  Cardiac channelopathies associated with structurally normal hearts such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) yield no evidence to be found at autopsy, leaving coroners, medical examiners, and forensic pathologists only to speculate that a lethal arrhythmia might lie at the heart of a sudden unexplained death (SUD). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare adrenergically mediated arrhythmogenic disorder classically induced by exercise or emotional stress and found in structurally normal hearts. It is an important cause of cardiac syncope and sudden death in childhood. We also compare CPVT to other notable cardiomyopathic and channelopathic causes of sudden death in youth including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disease that manifests as syncope or sudden death during high adrenergic tone in the absence of structural heart defects. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts Early detection of CPVT is crucial because opportune medical intervention prevents sudden cardiac death.   If untreated, CPVT is highly lethal, as approximately 30% of affected individuals experience at least one cardiac arrest and up to 80% one or more syncopal spells. Sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease.  Hereditary non-structural diseases such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), long QT, and the Brugada syndrome as well as structural disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) cause a significant percentage of sudden cardiac deaths in the young Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms. Although structural cardiovascular abnormalities explain most cases of sudden cardiac death in young people, the cause of death remains unexplained after autopsy in 10% to 30% of cases. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and the Brugada syndrome (BrS) may account for at least one-third of these unexplained cases.  Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death. The inherited arrhythmogenic diseases associated with the transmembranous ionic channels, anchoring proteins or intracellular calcium regulating proteins are thought to be responsible for sudden cardiac death in infants, children, and young adults who have structurally normal hearts. Recent genetic analyses have identified congenital diseases such as the long-QT syndrome (LQTS), the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), the Brugada syndrome (BrS), the short-QT syndrome (SQTS), the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 (ARVC2), and the catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) /familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (FPVT).  At least some cases of sudden, unexplained death in young individuals may be ascribed to CPVT"
Isn't oxidative stress affected by FOXO expression?,no,"Forkhead-box class O (FoxO) transcription factors regulate mechanisms of cellular aging, including protein quality control, autophagy and defenses against oxidative stress. Statin-mediated upregulation of klotho expression and differential regulation of FoxO expression promote resistance to CsA-induced oxidative stress. FoxO expression suppressed the ROS-induced apoptosis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells via the expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Differential expression of FOXO1 and FOXO3a confers resistance to oxidative cell death upon endometrial decidualization. We demonstrate that human endometrial stromal cells become extraordinarily resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis upon decidualization in response to cAMP and progesterone signaling. This differentiation process is associated with the induction of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, which in turn increases the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase. Comparative analysis demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide, a source of free radicals, strongly induces FOXO3a mRNA and protein expression in undifferentiated human endometrial stromal cells but not in decidualized cells. These results suggest that the induction of FOXO1 may enhance the ability of decidualized cells to prevent oxidative damage while the simultaneous repression of FOXO3a expression disables the signaling pathway responsible for oxidative cell death. The differential regulation of FOXO expression provides the decidua with a robust system capable of coping with prolonged episodes of oxidative stress during pregnancy."
Is it possible to visualize subtahalamic nucleus by using transcranial ultrasound?,yes,"After measuring thermal effects of TCS and imaging artefact sizes of DBS lead using a skull phantom, we prospectively enrolled 34 patients with DBS of globus pallidus internus, ventro-intermediate thalamic or subthalamic nucleus. TCS had no influence on lead temperature, electrical parameters of DBS device or clinical state of patients. TCS measures of lead coordinates agreed with MRI measures in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis. Lead dislocation requiring reinsertion was reliably detected. TCS may therefore become a first-choice modality to monitor lead location. Two pilot studies have demonstrated that the intraoperative visualization with TCS and the TCS-assisted insertion of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus interna are feasible and safe provided there is exact knowledge on the extent of electrode TCS imaging artifacts.  Peroperative transcranial sonography for electrode placement into the targeted subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson disease: technical note The correct anatomic position of the electrode tip could be indirectly assessed thanks to the topographic relationship of the STN with the hyperechogenic substantia nigra and the nucleus ruber. CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial sonography is easily feasible during stereotactic surgery. In combination with the clinical effects of electrostimulation on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and with stereotactic x-ray images, it enables the assessment and the documentation of the correct position of implanted STN electrodes in real time. After measuring thermal effects of TCS and imaging artefact sizes of DBS lead using a skull phantom, we prospectively enrolled 34 patients with DBS of globus pallidus internus, ventro-intermediate thalamic or subthalamic nucleus Two pilot studies have demonstrated that the intraoperative visualization with TCS and the TCS-assisted insertion of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus interna are feasible and safe provided there is exact knowledge on the extent of electrode TCS imaging artifacts"
Aren't nucleosomes positioned at DNA replication origins?,yes,"yeast origins are characterized by an asymmetric pattern of positioned nucleosomes flanking the ACS. The origin sequences are sufficient to maintain a nucleosome-free origin; however, ORC is required for the precise positioning of nucleosomes flanking the origin. Here, we identify nucleosome occupancy as a likely candidate to set up ORI distribution we demonstrate that open chromatin domains, characterized by nucleosome depletion, are preferentially permissive for replication Nucleosome assembly of the template prevented DNA replication. Replication of chromosomes was severely inhibited at more than two-thirds of physiological nucleosome density"
Is the HRC Ser96Ala variant associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy?,yes,"The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM. The Ser96Ala (S96A) mutation within the histidine rich Ca(2+) binding protein (HRC) has recently been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially attributable to an increase in spontaneous Ca(2+) release events. A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy. The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers.  HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM. The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers."
Does mTOR regulate the translation of MAPKAPK2?,yes,"mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Senescent cells secrete a combination of factors collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP reinforces senescence and activates an immune surveillance response, but it can also show pro-tumorigenic properties and contribute to age-related pathologies. In a drug screen to find new SASP regulators, we uncovered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a potent SASP suppressor. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. In turn, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 during senescence, inhibiting its ability to degrade the transcripts of numerous SASP components. Consequently, mTOR inhibition or constitutive activation of ZFP36L1 impairs the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescent cells in both tumour-suppressive and tumour-promoting contexts. Altogether, our results place regulation of the SASP as a key mechanism by which mTOR could influence cancer, age-related diseases and immune responses. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1 Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. Both Beclin1-PI3KIII and Beclin1-MAPKAPK2 interactions as were remarkably affected by silencing either ATM or MAPK14.ATM promoted IR-induced autophagy via the MAPK14 pathway, mTOR pathway and Beclin1/PI3KIII complexes. mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype."
Is selumetinib effective in thyroid cancer?,yes,"A phase I trial of vertical inhibition of IGF signalling using cixutumumab, an anti-IGF-1R antibody, and selumetinib, an MEK 1/2 inhibitor, in advanced solid tumours. BACKGROUND: We completed a phase I clinical trial to test the safety and toxicity of combined treatment with cixutumumab (anti-IGF-1R antibody) and selumetinib (MEK 1/2 inhibitor). Two patients achieved a partial response (one unconfirmed), including a patient with BRAF wild-type thyroid carcinoma, and a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and six patients achieved time to progression of>6 months, including patients with thyroid carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab and MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib showed that the combination is safe and well-tolerated at these doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and pharmacodynamic evidence of target inhibition. MHC class I loss is a frequent mechanism of immune escape in papillary thyroid cancer that is reversed by interferon and selumetinib treatment in vitro. Increased antigenicity following selumetinib and IFN treatment warrants further study for immunotherapy of progressive PTC. The role of KIs in differentiated TC may be revolutionised by the finding that selumetinib may restore a clinical response to radioactive iodine (RAI).  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with current chemotherapy, selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, but combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with BRAF or KRAS mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. Selumetinib-enhanced radioiodine uptake in advanced thyroid cancer. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer.  Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease.  ECENT FINDINGS: For patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancers, sorafenib, selumetinib, pazopanib and sunitinib have been investigated with promising results.  Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. Here, selumetinib targets the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in papillary thyroid carcinoma and shows limited single-agent activity in the patients with tumors that harbor the (V600E)BRAF mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease."
Is the gene MAOA epigenetically modified by methylation?,yes,"Evidence that the methylation state of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene predicts brain activity of MAO A enzyme in healthy men. We found significant interindividual differences in methylation status and methylation patterns of the core MAOA promoter.  In the present study, DNA methylation patterns in the MAOA regulatory and exon 1/intron 1 region were investigated for association with panic disorder with particular attention to possible effects of gender and environmental factors.   The present pilot data suggest a potential role of MAOA gene hypomethylation in the pathogenesis of panic disorder particularly in female patients, possibly mediating a detrimental influence of negative life events.  The MAOA promoter was hypermethylated immediately upstream of the start codon in cholangiocarcinoma samples and cell lines but not in nonmalignant counterparts.  MAOA promoter methylation and susceptibility to carotid atherosclerosis: role of familial factors in a monozygotic twin sample. Because twins reared together share early life experience, which may leave a long-lasting epigenetic mark, aberrant MAOA methylation may represent an early biomarker for unhealthy familial environment. Effects of MAOA promoter methylation on susceptibility to paranoid schizophrenia. In conclusion, abnormalities of DNA methylation at the MAOA promoter may be associated with schizophrenia in males. In our study we analyzed DNA methylation patterns of 14 neuropsychiatric genes (COMT, DAT1, GABRA1, GNB3, GRIN2B, HTR1B, HTR2A, 5-HTT, MAOA, MAOB, NOS1, NR3C1, TPH1 and TH). D Our data suggest that aberrant epigenetic regulation of neuropsychiatric genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD. We conclude that smoking reliably decreases MAOA methylation, but exact characterization of effects on level of methylation depend on genotype, smoking history, current smoking status, gender, and region of the promoter-associated CpG Island examined. Given that DNA methylation is linked to the regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms factor into the MAOA expression  the extended MAOA regulatory region contains two CpG islands (CGIs), one of which overlaps with the canonical MAOA promoter and the other is located further upstream; both CGIs exhibit sensitivity to differential methylation. Identification and characterization of putative methylation targets in the MAOA locus using bioinformatic approaches. DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism involved in the developmental regulation of gene expression.  MAOA methylation is associated with nicotine and alcohol dependence in women. In recent years, the role of epigenetic phenomenon, such as methylation, in mediating vulnerability to behavioral illness has become increasingly appreciated. One prominent locus at which epigenetic phenomena are thought to be in play is the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) locus.  We conclude that methylation of MAOA may play a significant role in common psychiatric illness and that further examination of epigenetic processes at this locus is in order. Analysis of CpG methylation in the MAOA promoter region revealed substantial methylation in females but not in males. Therefore, allelic mRNA expression is affected by genetic and epigenetic events, both with the potential to modulate biogenic amine tone in the CNS."
Does the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?,yes,"To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci. By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci Here we show that zebrafish runx1 is directly bound by cohesin and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) at the P1 and P2 promoters, and within the intron between P1 and P2. The intronic binding sites for cohesin and CTCF coincide with histone modifications that confer enhancer-like properties, and two of the cohesin/CTCF sites behaved as insulators in an in vivo assay The identified cohesin and CTCF binding sites are likely to be cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for runx1 since they also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We have found that CTCF and cohesin are highly enriched at the convergent and partially overlapping transcripts for the LMP1 and LMP2A genes, but it is not yet known how CTCF and cohesin may coordinately regulate these transcripts haracterization of constitutive CTCF/cohesin loci: a possible role in establishing topological domains in mammalian genomes Our analysis revealed: 1) constitutive CTCF loci were located in constitutive open chromatin and often co-localized with constitutive cohesin loci In brain, a third of CTCF and cohesin binding sites coincide, consistent with the potential for many interactions between cohesin and CTCF but also many instances of independent action Here, we focus on the emerging roles of CTCF and the cohesin in coordinating long-range interactions between regulatory elements Chromatin immunoprecipitation for CTCF and the cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC3 reveals evolutionarily conserved binding sites within unmethylated regions ∼5 kb downstream of the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region and within the PLAGL1 3' untranslated region (UTR) TCF physically links cohesin to chromatin ohesin and CTCF: cooperating to control chromosome conformation? Recently, three groups mapped numerous cohesin-binding sites in mammalian chromosomes and found substantial overlap with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) We found that each site contains a conserved CTCF consensus sequence, binds CTCF, and recruits the cohesin subunit Rad21 in vivo Recent experiments have revealed that cohesin binds to the same sites in mammalian genomes as the zinc finger transcription factor CTCF Here we review what is known about the roles of cohesin and CTCF in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells, and we discuss how cohesin might mediate the insulator function of CTCF Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival We used chromosome conformation capture to determine long-range interactions among CTCF/cohesin sites over 2 Mb on human chromosome 11 encompassing the beta-globin locus and flanking olfactory receptor genes These results support a genome-wide role for CTCF/cohesin sites through loop formation that both influences transcription and contributes to cell-type-specific chromatin organization and function Increased methylation at this promoter triggered the dissociation of the insulator protein CTCF as well as the accompanying cohesin from the BDNF locus icotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-regulated DNA methylation alters CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding and transcription at the BDNF locus ecent studies have shown that the protein CTCF, which plays an important role in insulation and in large-scale organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus, depends for both activities on recruitment of the cohesin complex We show here that the interaction of CTCF with the cohesin complex involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit SA2 and specific regions of the C-terminal tail of CTCF Taken together, our results demonstrate that specific sites on the C terminus of CTCF are essential for cohesin binding and insulator function The only direct interaction between CTCF and cohesin involves contact with SA2, which is external to the cohesin ring These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement We have previously shown that the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) major latency transcripts encoding LANA, vCyclin, vFLIP, v-miRNAs, and Kaposin are regulated, in part, by a chromatin organizing element that binds CTCF and cohesins Mutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages, and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number control Our findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions, and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control. We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript. GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites. GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron. These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability. TCF and cohesin cooperatively mediate the cell-type specific interchromatin interaction between Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF and cohesin. enome-wide studies of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin provide insight into chromatin structure and regulation Recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with cohesin Here, we show by ChIP-Seq that most human subtelomeres contain a CTCF- and cohesin-binding site within ∼1-2 kb of the TTAGGG repeat tract and adjacent to a CpG-islands implicated in TERRA transcription control. These findings indicate that CTCF and cohesin are integral components of most human subtelomeres, and important for the regulation of TERRA transcription and telomere end protection In addition, we show that this DNA looping requires specific binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex to two symmetrically aligned binding sites in both the transcriptionally active promoters and in one of the enhancers"
Isn't SUMOylation a post-translational modification in eukaryotes?,no,"SUMOylation, the conjugation of target proteins with SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier), is a type of post-translational modification in eukaryotes and involves the sequential action of activation (E1), conjugation (E2) and ligation (E3) enzymes.  Plants have evolved to cope with changing environmental conditions. One way plants achieve this is through post-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitination and SUMOylation. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification essential in most eukaryotes that regulates stability, localization, activity, or interaction of a multitude of proteins. SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes.  Post-translational modification by SUMO is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that plays very important regulatory roles in many cellular processes.  SUMOylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression. Although the SUMOylation pathway has been identified and investigated in many eukaryotes, the mechanisms of SUMOylation in regulating the functions of various substrates are still poorly understood.  SUMOylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes. SUMOylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for genome stability. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Besides phosphorylation or ubiquitylation, for which many examples of modulation by pathogens exist, a post-translational modification called SUMOylation was recently shown to be targeted by pathogenic bacteria. cruzi SUMOylated proteins are similarly modified, indicating conserved functions for protein SUMOylation in this early divergent eukaryote. PML is a potent tumor suppressor and proapoptotic factor and is functionally regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination. SUMOylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression. SUMOylation in Giardia lamblia: A Conserved Post-Translational Modification in One of the Earliest Divergent Eukaryotes SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes SUMOylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are one facet of this proteasomal regulation, with over 400 known phosphorylation sites, over 500 ubiquitination sites and 83 internal lysine acetylation sites, as well as multiple sites for caspase cleavage, glycosylation (such as O-GlcNAc modification), methylation, nitrosylation, oxidation, and SUMOylation SUMOylation is an important post-translational modification, and Akt SUMOylation was found to regulate cell proliferation, tumorigenesis and cell cycle, but the molecular mechanism of Akt SUMOylation is less well known SUMOylation is a form of post-translational modification where small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) are covalently attached to target proteins to regulate their properties One distinctive feature in acute proteotoxic stresses, such as heat shock (HS), is rapid post-translational modification of proteins by SUMOs (small ubiquitin-like modifier proteins; SUMOylation) Post-translational modification by the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) proteins, a process termed SUMOylation, is involved in many fundamental cellular processes SUMOylation is an important post-translational modification that is involved in many key biological processes Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) undergo post-translational modification by SUMO in in vitro assays but the SUMOylation of full-length mGluRs in mammalian cells has not been reported SUMOylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes.  However, the effects of pathogenic bacteria on SUMOylation, an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells, remain largely unknown.  A novel post-translational modification of nucleolin, SUMOylation at Lys-294, mediates arsenite-induced cell death by regulating gadd45� mRNA stability. Drosophila Bicoid is a substrate of sumoylation and its activator function is subject to inhibition by this post-translational modification. Here, we demonstrate that SUMOylation of RelB might be one of these post-translational modifications rendering the function of the NF-�B transcription factor RelB.  In the last decade, SUMOylation has emerged as an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes. SUMOylation, the conjugation of target proteins with SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier), is a type of post-translational modification in eukaryotes and involves the sequential action of activation (E1), conjugation (E2) and ligation (E3) enzymes. SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes. One way plants achieve this is through post-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitination and SUMOylation. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in eukaryotes is an essential post-translational modification required for a variety of cellular processes, development and organelle biogenesis. Post-translational modification by SUMO is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that plays very important regulatory roles in many cellular processes. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. We identified 70 phosphorylation and four acetylation events in proximity to SUMOylation sites, and we provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3. SUMOylation regulates target proteins involved in all nuclear processes including transcription, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, precursor-mRNA splicing and ribosome assembly. SUMOylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for genome stability. Using high-resolution MS, we have studied global SUMOylation in human cells in a site-specific manner, identifying a total of>4,300 SUMOylation sites in>1,600 proteins. We quantitatively studied SUMOylation dynamics in response to SUMO protease inhibition, proteasome inhibition and heat shock. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. We identified 70 phosphorylation and four acetylation events in proximity to SUMOylation sites, and we provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. Indeed, SU(VAR)3-7 is sumoylated at lysine K839; this modification is required for localization of SU(VAR)3-7 at pericentric heterochromatin, chromosome 4, and telomeres. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. Our results suggest a new level of regulation of Sall activity in vivo during animal development through post-translational modification by sumoylation. BACKGROUND: Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier protein (SUMO) is a key regulator of nuclear functions but little is known regarding the role of the post-translational modification sumoylation outside of the nucleus, particularly in the Central Nervous System (CNS).METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that the expression levels of SUMO-modified substrates as well as the components of the sumoylation machinery are temporally and spatially regulated in the developing rat brain. SUMOylation in Giardia lamblia: A Conserved Post-Translational Modification in One of the Earliest Divergent Eukaryotes. Identification of a novel post-translational modification in Plasmodium falciparum: protein sumoylation in different cellular compartments. More recently, Akt has been identified as a substrate for many different post-translational modifications, including not only phosphorylation of other residues, but also acetylation, glycosylation, oxidation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation."
Isn't there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioblastoma patients?,no,"Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas. Patients with tumors lacking hTERT expression/TA showed a significant survival benefit (Kaplan-Meier test, both P < .01), which, however, was based exclusively on the younger patient subgroup (≤60 y, both P < .005; >60 y, both ns).  Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs"
Isn't it feasible to obtain DNA read lengths that exceed 30 Kb?,yes,"Single-molecule, real-time sequencing (SMRT) developed by Pacific BioSciences produces longer reads than secondary generation sequencing technologies such as Illumina. The long read length enables PacBio sequencing to close gaps in genome assembly, reveal structural variations, and identify gene isoforms with higher accuracy in transcriptomic sequencing.  Third-generation sequencing, with read lengths>10 kb, will improve the assembly of complex genomes, but these techniques require high-molecular-weight genomic DNA (gDNA), and gDNA extraction protocols used for obtaining smaller fragments for short-read sequencing are not suitable for this purpose. The emergence and development of so called third generation sequencing platforms such as PacBio has permitted exceptionally long reads (over 20 kb) to be generated."
Does SCRIB deregulation promote cancer?,yes,"human homologs of Drosophila dlg, scrib, and lgl are cancer-associated genes. Aberrant overexpression of the cell polarity module scribble in human cancer. we show that Scrib is nearly universally overexpressed in cultured tumor cell lines and genetically disparate cancer patient series compared with matched normal tissues in vivo.  These data uncover a previously unrecognized exploitation of Scrib for aberrant tumor cell motility and invasion, thus potentially contributing to disease progression in humans. oss of miR-296 causes aberrantly increased and mislocalized Scrib in human tumors, resulting in exaggerated random cell migration and tumor cell invasiveness.  Scrib levels predict tumor relapse in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Scrib heterozygosity predisposes to lung cancer loss of Scrib and activated oncogenic KRas cooperate in vivo, resulting in more aggressive lung tumors, l Scribble, a product of a well-known tumor suppressor gene CD74-dependent deregulation of the tumor suppressor scribble in human epithelial and breast cancer cells.  scribble (SCRIB) complexes) is intricately related to advanced stages of tumour progression and invasiveness.  SCRIB expression is deregulated in human prostate cancer, Scrib heterozygosity initiated prostate hyperplasia The clinical significance of the work in mice was highlighted by our observation that SCRIB deregulation strongly correlated with poor survival in human prostate cancer. we demonstrate that scribble inhibits breast cancer formation and that deregulation of polarity pathways promotes dysplastic and neoplastic growth in mammals by disrupting morphogenesis and inhibiting cell death. Deregulation of scribble promotes mammary tumorigenesis and reveals a role for cell polarity in carcinoma. loss of Scribble promotes invasion of cells through extracellular matrix in an organotypic culture system. Scribble expression is decreased in many invasive human cancers. Loss of human Scribble cooperates with H-Ras to promote cell invasion through deregulation of MAPK signalling."
"A bite from the Lone Star Tick Amblyomma americanum, can't cause the victim to become allergic to red meat, yes or no?",no,"A recent discovery of an IgE antibody specific to galactose-α-1,3-galactose, which is a carbohydrate abundantly expressed on cells and tissues of beef, pork, and lamb, adds one more tool to aid the clinician in making the appropriate diagnosis. A link has been discovered between the bite of the Lone Star Tick (Amblyomma americanum) and the development of sensitivity to galactose-α-1,3-galactose.  . Recently described conditions such as Southern tick-associated rash illness and anaphylaxis to red meat following tick bites have been attributed to the lone star tick. Recently described conditions such as Southern tick-associated rash illness and anaphylaxis to red meat following tick bites have been attributed to the lone star tick."
Are cyclophilins proteins that bind to prolines?,yes,Cyclophilins are ubiquitously expressed proteins that bind to prolines and can catalyse cis/trans isomerization of proline residues. a characteristic of the cyclophilin family of proteins that bind prolines and often act as cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerases.  The cyclophilins are widely expressed enzymes that catalyze the interconversion of the cis and trans peptide bonds of prolines.   an immunophilin on the isomerization of critical prolines that are found in the tCHT1 sequence.
Isn't diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membranes?,no,"A unique organelle for studying membrane biochemistry is the mitochondrion whose functionality depends on a coordinated supply of proteins and lipids. Mitochondria are capable of synthesizing several lipids autonomously such as phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin and in part phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid and CDP-diacylglycerol. A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane.  Diphosphatidylglycerol was confined to the mitochondrial fraction, where it represented about 7% of the total phosphoacylglycerols.  Mitochondrial membranes were isolated from the myocardium of young (4-month-old) and aged (33-month-old) male Long-Evans rats and compared in terms of cholesterol content and phospholipid and fatty acid composition. In aged rats, as compared to young, the major observations include: markedly higher cholesterol content; increased percentage of sphingomyelin and diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin);  The polyglycerophosphatides (typified by diphosphatidylglycerol) were apparently synthesized in situ by intramitochondrial membrane-bound enzymes using CDP-diglycerides as intermediates.  Both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions contained significant proportions of solvent front phospholipid (SFP) and whereas the mitochondrial SFP displayed the relatively unsaturated fatty acid composition characteristic of diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin), the fatty acids of the microsomal SFP were distinctly more saturated. Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). The enzyme responsible for the conversion of phosphatidylglycerol to diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) in the presence of cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol is firmly associated with mitochondrial membranes and is not extracted with hypotonic or hypertonic media or with nonionic detergents. The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria. In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold. Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). 90% or more of the phospholipid, cardiolipin was found in the mitochondrial membranes of wild type and petite yeast. Furthermore, the same mechanism for the biosynthesis of cardiolipin was operational in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria Cardiolipin (CL) is a key phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, playing important roles in maintaining the functional integrity and dynamics of mitochondria in animals and yeasts Cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondria, is involved in the biogenesis, the dynamics, and the supramolecular organization of mitochondrial membranes Cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, is crucial for both mitochondrial function and cellular processes outside of the mitochondria Since it has been recognized that mitochondria are crucial not only for energy metabolism but also for other cellular functions, there has been a growing interest in cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes Cardiolipin, the main anionic phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, is expected to be a determinant in this adaptive mechanism since it modulates the activity of most membrane proteins Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) Cardiolipin is normally localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane; however, when cardiolipin becomes externalized to the surface of dysregulated mitochondria, it promotes inflammasome activation and stimulates the elimination of damaged or nonfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold.  Increasing levels of cardiolipin differentially influence packing of phospholipids found in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae subjected to conditions that affect mitochondrial metabolism as a model to determine the possible role of cardiolipin in stress adaptation.  This decline of respiration was attributed to a progressive diminution of the number of mitochondria in copper-treated cells, based on the demonstration of the concomitant decline of (1) cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) and cytochrome aa3 (cytochrome oxidase), two specific markers of mitochondrial inner membrane, and (2) fumarase activity, a specific marker of mitochondrial matrix space. Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) or cardiolipin, a specific component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, represents about 4% of the total lipid content. Experimental results confirmed that the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, from the membrane-bound radioactive phosphatidylglycerol in intact mitochondria isolated from guinea pig and rat liver, was absolutely dependent on CDP-diglycerides and required the addition of divalent cations. We have shown that decrease of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membrane occurs early during ischemia, and only during the irreversible phase of ischemia are phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine broken down. Partial purification of diphosphatidylglycerol synthetase from liver mitochondrial membranes. A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane."
Can't a peptide aptamer be used as protein inhibitor?,no,"Peptide aptamers of LIM-only protein 2 (Lmo2) were previously used to successfully treat Lmo2-induced tumours in a mouse model of leukaemia. Inhibition of mammalian cell proliferation by genetically selected peptide aptamers that functionally antagonize E2F activity. Accumulating work over the past decade has shown that peptide aptamer screening represents a valid strategy for inhibitor identification that can be applied to a variety of different targets.  . The target of one inhibitor peptide, Pep80, identified in this screen was determined to be Snapin, a protein associated with the soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor adaptor protein receptor (SNARE) complex that is critical for calcium-dependent exocytosis during neurotransmission.  Use of the genetically selected intracellular aptamer inhibitors allowed us to define unique mechanisms important to HIV-1 replication and T cell biology. This review will describe pre-clinical and clinical data of four major classes of TGF-β inhibitor, namely i) ligand traps, ii) antisense oligonucleotides, iii) receptor kinase inhibitors and iv) peptide aptamers.   A peptide aptamer (ID1/3-PA7) has been designed to prevent this interaction and thereby leading to the transcription of p16(INK4a). A peptide kinase inhibitor (IP(20)) was used as the aptameric peptide  Peptide aptamer mimicking RAD51-binding domain of BRCA2 inhibits DNA damage repair and survival in Trypanosoma brucei.  peptide aptamer, Id1/3-PA7, targeting Id1 and Id3, Targeting Id1 and Id3 by a specific peptide aptamer induces E-box promoter activity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Aptamer-derived peptides as potent inhibitors of the oncogenic RhoGEF Tgat. Our approach thus demonstrates that peptide aptamers are potent inhibitors that can be used to interfere with RhoGEF functions in vivo. Development of systemic in vitro evolution and its application to generation of peptide-aptamer-based inhibitors of cathepsin E. he fusion peptide, TA aptamer, was observed within PC12 cytoplasm and maintained both Abeta-binding ability and antioxygenic property similar to TRX. Stable expression of a novel fusion peptide of thioredoxin-1 and ABAD-inhibiting peptide protects PC12 cells from intracellular amyloid-beta. In order to efficiently select aptamers that bind to and inhibit proteins, Aptamer selection based on inhibitory activity using an evolution-mimicking algorithm. This demonstrates the utility of this strategy for screening aptamers based on their inhibitory actions. Intracellular expression of the DRD-binding peptide aptamer specifically suppressed receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis but not intrinsic pathway, which was recapitulated by the antisense oligonucleotides for FLASH.  Peptide aptamers are peptides constrained and presented by a scaffold protein that are used to study protein function in cells. They are able to disrupt protein-protein interactions  Here we have used a genetic screen in yeast to select in vivo peptides coupled to thioredoxin, called aptamers, that could inhibit GEFD2 activity. One aptamer, TRIAPalpha (TRio Inhibitory APtamer), specifically blocks GEFD2-exchange activity on RhoA in vitro. These results show that cell proliferation can be inhibited using genetically-selected synthetic peptides that specifically target protein-protein interaction motifs within cell cycle regulators. These data highlight the utility of peptide aptamers to identify novel binding interfaces and highlight a role for MAP1B in DAPK-1-dependent signaling in autophagy and membrane blebbing."
Aren't there conserved noncoding elements identified between genomes of human and teleosts?,no,"We report evidence for a mechanism for the maintenance of long-range conserved synteny across vertebrate genomes. We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated ""bystander"" genes After whole genome duplication in teleosts, GRBs, including HCNEs and target genes, were often maintained in both copies, while bystander genes were typically lost from one GRB, strongly suggesting that evolutionary pressure acts to keep the single-copy GRBs of higher vertebrates intact. We show that loss of bystander genes and other mutational events suffered by duplicated GRBs in teleost genomes permits target gene identification and HCNE/target gene assignment Vertebrate genomes contain thousands of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) that often function as tissue-specific enhancers. In this study, we have identified CNEs in human, dog, chicken, Xenopus, and four teleost fishes (zebrafish, stickleback, medaka, and fugu) using elephant shark, a cartilaginous vertebrate, as the base genome and investigated the evolution of these ancient vertebrate CNEs (aCNEs) in bony vertebrate lineages This implicates the ""fish-specific"" whole-genome duplication in the accelerated evolution and the loss of a large number of both copies of duplicated CNEs in teleost fishes We found zebrafish conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) with pan-vertebrate as well as fish-specific orthologous sequences from across 200 kb of the zebrafish fgf8a genomic regulatory block to direct reporter expression in patterns consistent with the expression pattern of fgf8a  A significant number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) shared between cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods have diverged beyond recognition in teleost fishes. The divergence of CNEs seems to have been initiated in basal ray-finned fishes before the WGD. The fast evolving singleton and duplicated genes as well as the divergent CNEs might have contributed to the diversity of teleost fishes We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated ""bystander"" genes. Ancient vertebrate conserved noncoding elements have been evolving rapidly in teleost fishes. A significant number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) shared between cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods have diverged beyond recognition in teleost fishes. We have used a transposon-based transgenic assay in zebrafish to evaluate noncoding sequences at the zebrafish ret locus, conserved among teleosts, and at the human RET locus, conserved among mammals. Using computational analysis and exploiting the diversity of teleost genomes, we identified a cluster of highly conserved noncoding sequences surrounding the Six3 gene"
Is dasatinib effective for treatment of glioblastoma?,no,"RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Intraparticipant dose escalation was feasible, but dasatinib was ineffective in recurrent GBM.  Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.35 months (95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.4) and 6-month PFS was 7.7%. In this phase I study of recurrent glioblastoma patients, the combination of CCNU and dasatinib showed significant hematological toxicities and led to suboptimal exposure to both agents. Dasatinib in conjunction with bevacizumab does not appear to have activity in patients with recurrent, heavily pretreated GBM."
Are there Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) in plant genomes?,yes,"Conservation and functional element discovery in 20 angiosperm plant genomes The detailed view of conservation across angiosperms revealed not only high coding-sequence conservation but also a large set of previously uncharacterized intergenic conservation Conserved noncoding sequences highlight shared components of regulatory networks in dicotyledonous plants Using a comparative genomics approach with four dicotyledonous plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, papaya [Carica papaya], poplar [Populus trichocarpa], and grape [Vitis vinifera]), we detected hundreds of CNSs upstream of Arabidopsis genes Long identical multispecies elements in plant and animal genomes. Using an alignment-free information-retrieval approach, we have comprehensively identified all long identical multispecies elements (LIMEs), which include both syntenic and nonsyntenic regions, of at least 100 identical base pairs shared by at least two genomes In contrast, among six plant genomes, we only found nonsyntenic LIMEs  Although complex LIMEs were found in both animal and plant genomes, they differed significantly in their composition and copy number Ultraconserved elements between the genomes of the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and rice We consequently compared the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, which diverged about 200 million years ago, and identified 25 ultraconserved elements that are longer than 100 bp ultraconserved elements in plants tend to occur in clusters and locate at noncoding regions the functions of these plant ultraconserved elements and the reasons why they are practically frozen during the evolution of millions of years remain a mystery Conserved noncoding sequences in the grasses  Using a local sequence alignment set to deliver only significant alignments, we found one or more CNSs in the noncoding regions of the majority of genes studied. Grass genes have dramatically fewer and much smaller CNSs than mammalian genes Conserved noncoding sequences among cultivated cereal genomes identify candidate regulatory sequence elements and patterns of promoter evolution Surveys for conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) among genes from monocot cereal species were conducted to assess the general properties of CNS in grass genomes and their correlation with known promoter regulatory elements Comparisons of orthologous maize-rice and maize-sorghum gene pairs identified 20 bp as a minimal length criterion for a significant CNS among grass genes, with few such CNS found to be conserved across rice, maize, sorghum, and barley"
Is Downs syndrome associated with decreased risk of leukemia?,no,The association of Down's syndrome and leukemia has been documented for over 50 years. Multiple studies have established the incidence of leukemia in Down's syndrome patients to be 10- to 20-fold higher than that in the general population. We present a case of congenital acute myeloid leukemia manifesting from the very first day of birth. Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was suspected by the presence of blasts in the peripheral blood smear and was confirmed on bone marrow by flowcytometry. Karyotyping revealed Trisomy 21. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and a solitary cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Downs syndrome.  This was thus confirmed to be a case with transient leukemia with Downs syndrome.
Isn't DNA methylation an epigenetic modification of chromatin related to gene expression?,no,"DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA involved in the regulation of gene expression by controlling the access to the DNA sequence.  Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation play important biological roles in gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation during development. DNA methylation patterns are characterized by highly conserved developmental programs, but allow for divergent gene expression resulting from stochastic epigenetic drift or divergent environments. DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression.  Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone methylation and acetylation alter gene expression at the level of transcription by upregulating, downregulating, or silencing genes completely. Dysregulation of epigenetic events can be pathological, leading to cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, metabolic disorders, and cancer development. DNA methylation is a pervasive epigenetic DNA modification that strongly affects chromatin regulation and gene expression. Epigenetic control, which includes DNA methylation and histone modifications, leads to chromatin remodeling and regulated gene expression. Epigenetic modifications on the DNA sequence (DNA methylation) or on chromatin-associated proteins (i.e., histones) comprise the ""cellular epigenome""; together these modifications play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Epigenetics is a process involved in gene regulation, mediated via DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and functional noncoding RNAs, which influences the accessibility of the underlying DNA to transcriptional regulatory factors that activate or repress expression. Significant progress has been made in the basic understanding of how various epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, miRNA expression, and higher order chromatin structure affect gene expression."
Does  thyroid hormone receptor beta1 affect insulin secretion?,no,"We demonstrated that thyroid hormone T3 rapidly induces Akt activation in pancreatic beta cells rRINm5F and hCM via thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta1. The silencing of TRbeta1 expression through RNAi confirmed this receptor to be crucial for the T3-induced activation of Akt. T3 is able to specifically activate Akt in the islet beta cells rRINm5F and hCM through the interaction between TRbeta1 and PI3K p85alpha, demonstrating the involvement of TRbeta1 in this novel T3 non-genomic action in islet beta cells."
Isn't DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?,no,"Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters. Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes. I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively. Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. DNA methylation directly silences genes with non-CpG island promoters and establishes a nucleosome occupied promoter. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters.  Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture. The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar.  DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning.  DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the 5'-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. he induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other. Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this ""ground state"" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy.  In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. Throughout the genome, nucleosome occupancy was correlated with certain histone methylation or acetylation modifications. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted."
Isn't Marfan syndrome associated with chordal rupture?,no,"Repair of the mitral valve in children who have Marfan syndrome is especially difficult due to the presence of generalized connective tissue disorder, which may lead to future elongation and rupture of chordae tendineae that were unaffected at the time of mitral valve repair. Mitral regurgitation was caused by annulus dilatation in all patients, by leaflet prolapse in five patients, and by chordal rupture due to endocarditis in two.  Perioperative coronary artery spasm in modified Bentall's operation for annulo-aortic ectasia in Marfan's syndrome. A case report of perioperative chordal rupture of the mitral valve. In a modified Bentall's operation (button technique), perioperative severe coronary artery spasm occurred in spite of the preventive use of nitroglycerin infusion, which resulted in profound ventricular fibrillation and subsequent chordal rupture of the mitral valve with Sellers IV regurgitation. It is worthy to report this case because of rarities such as Marfan's syndrome accompanied by Prinzmetal's variant angina, perioperative coronary artery spasm in modified Bentall's operation, and perioperative chordal rupture of the mitral valve and progression of mitral valve regurgitation.   The four Major Complications- sudden death, infective endocarditis, spontaneous rupture of chordae tendineae, and progressive mitral regurgitation- are examined. Associated Cardiac Diseases, i.e., Marfan's syndrome, ostium secundum atrial septal defect and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, are discussed, and a section on Treatment deals chiefly with prophylaxis for infective endocarditis and the management of arrhythmias and chest pain.

Can NXY-059 be used for treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients?,no,"Even when the international recommendations for preclinical stroke research, the Stroke Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria, were followed, we have still seen limited success in the clinic, examples being NXY-059 and haematopoietic growth factors which fulfilled nearly all the STAIR criteria This occurred during 1993-2006, when the 2,4-disulfonylphenyl PBN derivative, called NXY-059 in the stroke studies, was shown to be safe in humans and was taken all the way through clinical phase 3 trials and then was deemed to be ineffective.  The nitrone-based compound NXY-059, which is the first drug to reach clinical trials for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, has provided promise for the development of more robust pharmacological agents.  OKN-007 is a proprietary compound that has had extensive commercial development (designated as NXY-059) for another indication, acute ischemic stroke, and after extensive clinical studies was shown to lack efficacy for this indication but was shown to be very safe for human use.  NXY-059, a polar compound with limited transport across the blood-brain barrier, has demonstrated neuroprotection in several animal models of acute ischemic stroke but failed to confirm clinical benefit in the second phase III trial (SAINT-II). NXY-059 is no longer in development following a lack of efficacy found in a Phase III trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke.  We analyzed the quality and adequacy of animal studies supporting the efficacy of NXY-059 and other neuroprotective agents that are currently being investigated in phase II/III trials  In the aftermath of the failed stroke clinical trials with the nitrone spin trap/radical scavenger, NXY-059, a number of articles raised the question: are we doing the right thing?   In 2006, the first positive trial of neuroprotection was published: the SAINT I (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment) study. In February 2008, the SAINT II study was published, indicating that NXY-059 was not effective for AIS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for treatment of AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The SAINT I trial that showed a significant benefit of the neuroprotectant NXY-059 used a novel outcome for acute ischemic stroke trials: a shift toward good functional outcome on the 7-category modified Rankin scale (mRS). BACKGROUND: The free-radical-trapping agent NXY-059 showed promise as a neuroprotectant in the Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment I (SAINT I) trial, reducing disability when given to patients who had acute ischemic stroke.  CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. The continued failure in approving new drugs for treatment of acute stroke has been recently set back by the failure of the NXY-059 (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment (SAINT) II) trial. The SAINT II Trial, a large randomized multicenter clinical trial of the putative neuroprotectant, NXY-059, failed to demonstrate a treatment benefit in acute ischemic stroke.  The positive results from the first Stroke-Acute-Ischaemic-NXY-Treatment (SAINT-I) trial of the free-radical spin-trap drug, NXY-059, which followed many of the STAIR guidelines, reinvigorated enthusiasm in neuroprotection, but the SAINT-II trial did not replicate the positive effect on the same primary prespecified outcome measure.  NXY-059, a free radical spin trap agent, was felt by many to have followed these criteria and it was recently shown to improve outcome in AIS patients in the SAINT I trial. However, the repeat, SAINT II trial was a neutral study, the results of which cast doubt on neuroprotection as a viable strategy for AIS.  NXY-059 is a novel free radical-trapping neuroprotectant that reduces infarct size and preserves brain function in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. It is the first neuroprotectant to demonstrate a reduction in global disability in a phase III clinical trial, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NXY-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 within 6 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly reduced disability.  CONCLUSIONS: The administration of NXY-059 within six hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke significantly improved the primary outcome (reduced disability at 90 days), but it did not significantly improve other outcome measures, including neurologic functioning as measured by the NIHSS score. Additional research is needed to confirm whether NXY-059 is beneficial in ischemic stroke.  BACKGROUND: The free-radical-trapping agent NXY-059 showed promise as a neuroprotectant in the Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment I (SAINT I) trial, reducing disability when given to patients who had acute ischemic stroke. NXY-059 is no longer in development following a lack of efficacy found in a Phase III trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The free-radical-trapping agent NXY-059 showed promise as a neuroprotectant in the Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment I (SAINT I) trial, reducing disability when given to patients who had acute ischemic stroke The continued failure in approving new drugs for treatment of acute stroke has been recently set back by the failure of the NXY-059 (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment (SAINT) II) trial"
Isn't dichlorphenamide effective for periodic paralysis?,no,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). In one study dichlorphenamide (DCP) vs placebo was tested in two groups of participants: 42 with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and 31 with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP), based on clinical criteria. Thirty-four of 42 participants with hypokalemic periodic paralysis completed both treatment phases. For the 34 participants having attack rate data for both treatment phases, the mean improvement in attack rate (P = 0.02) and severity-weighted attack rate (P = 0.01) on DCP relative to placebo were statistically significant.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The largest included study that met our inclusion criteria suggested that DCP was effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralyses. For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.  Chronically, acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide, or potassium-sparing diuretics decrease attack frequency and severity but are of little value acutely.   In the HypoPP trial, there were 13 subjects who exhibited a preference (in terms of the end point) for either DCP or placebo, and 11 of these preferred DCP. In the PSPP trial, DCP significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo. DCP also significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo in the HypoPP subjects. We conclude that DCP is effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both HypoPP and PSPP. Diclofenamid has now already been administered for 2 years. It is well tolerated and has suppressed further attacks. Three patients with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HOPP)-associated progressive interattack muscle weakness, who became unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide, responded favorably to dichlorophenamide, a more potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Dichlorophenamide in single-blind placebo-controlled trials, considerably improved functional strength in two of the patients and had a moderate but definite effect in the third. Dichlorophenamide should be considered as an alternate to acetazolamide in the treatment of patients with HOPP-associated interattack muscle weakness who have become unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide. Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). Whether these drugs prevent vacuolar myopathy, which is a pathogenic factor in hypoPP, is unknown.  Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. A second trial, comparing dichlorphenamide with acetazolamide versus placebo, is currently in progress. Despite our better understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders, current treatments are largely empirical and the evidence in favor of specific therapy largely anecdotal. For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis."
Isn't cardiac magnetic resonance imaging indicated in the pre-participation screening of athletes?,yes,"As modern imaging further enhances our understanding of the spectrum of athlete's heart, its role may expand from the assessment of athletes with suspected disease to being part of comprehensive pre-participation screening in apparently healthy athletes. Finally we will address the role of CMR in pre-participation screening."
"Aren't there studies representing the involvement of Notch mutations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Down syndrome, Pick's and Prion's disease, and cadasil syndrome?",no,"he Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies. Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling. In a forward genetic screen for mutations that alter intracellular Notch receptor trafficking in Drosophila melanogaster, we recovered mutants that disrupt genes encoding serine palmitoyltransferase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Signaling pathways have become a major source of targets for novel therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Survival benefits achieved with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, are unprecedented and underscore the importance of improving our understanding of how signaling networks interact in transformed cells. Notch-1 immunoexpression is increased in Alzheimer's and Pick's disease (PSEN1) is the major locus for mutations causing familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and is also mutated in Pick disease of brain, familial acne inversa and dilated cardiomyopathy. It is a critical facilitator of Notch signalling and many other signalling pathways and protein cleavage events including production of the Amyloidβ (Aβ) peptide from the AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP As beta-APP and Notch are both processed by gamma-secretase, we analyzed expression of the Notch signaling pathway in the adult DS brain and in a model system for DS, human trisomy 21 fibroblasts by quantitative PCR. In adult DS cortex we found that Notch1, Dll1 and Hes1 expression is up-regulated. Moreover, DS fibroblasts and Alzheimer disease cortex also show overexpression of Notch1 and Dll1, indicating that enhanced beta-APP processing found in both DS and AD could be instrumental in these changes A systems biology approach to Down syndrome: identification of Notch/Wnt dysregulation in a model of stem cells aging Notch3 gene has been recently identified as a causative gene for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)"
Can't multiple myeloma patients develop hyperviscosity syndrome?,no,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an immedicable malignancy of the human plasma cells producing abnormal antibodies (also referred to as paraproteins) leading to kidney problems and hyperviscosity syndrome.  This skin condition may be observed in patients with the following condtions, such as primary polycythemic hyperviscosity (polycythemia, thrombocytemia) treated with hydroxyurea, primary plasma hyperviscosity (multiple myeloma, cryoglobulinemia, cryofibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia, and connective tissue diseases), primary sclerocythemic hyperviscosity (hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, and sickle cell disease).   A 73-year-old woman with known MM who received little treatment for several years, presented secondary to dysarthria and at first was thought to have hyperviscosity syndrome.   After a comprehensive evaluation ruled out common causes of acute renal failure, the patient underwent testing with a bone survey, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), and immunoelectrophoresis for suspected plasma cell dyscrasia and received plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome and nephrotoxicity, which resulted in improved renal function. Lab results showed monoclonal gammopathy, elevated serum free light chains, and Bence Jones protein in the urine with a follow-up bone marrow biopsy indicating plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient received a diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) and was started on chemotherapy and immunosuppression.  Plasmapheresis (PE) is recommended for patients with hyperviscosity syndrome or cast nephropathy presented with AKI, which may help to increase the dialysis-independency. Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder resulting from malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. It can cause a hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to the paraproteinaemia associated with the disease. The increased hyperviscosity can lead to retinal vein occlusions and other ocular problems that may challenge clinicians.  Etiologies are various but symptomatic hyperviscosity is more common in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma.  Double filtration plasmapheresis in a dog with multiple myeloma and hyperviscosity syndrome. A 12 year old, 38 kg, mix-breed, intact male dog presented with a 20 day history of clinical signs consistent with hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to multiple myeloma.  The present study reported for the first time the use of double filtration plasmapheresis to reduce clinical signs of hyperviscosity syndrome in a dog with multiple myeloma. An otherwise healthy young man presents with bilateral CRVO as the first sign of hyperviscosity syndrome in the setting of new multiple myeloma.  In haematology the most common indication for plasmapheresis is the supportive treatment of multiple myeloma. The procedure is performed in patients with high protein levels endangered with hyperviscosity syndrome. Five to 10 percent of patients with multiple myeloma are suffered from the hyperviscosity syndrome because of increased serum viscosity due to the presence of myeloma protein. Plasmapheresis is known as an efficient method for rapid improvement of the hyperviscosity syndrome, and double filtration plasmapheresis is most commonly used for plasma exchange of multiple myeloma patients in our country. PE is the most effective method in the treatment of hyperviscosity syndrome often seen with multiple myeloma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and it is therapy of choice for this complication. Patients with multiple myeloma who have complications secondary to hyperviscosity are treated by chemotherapy and/or plasmapheresis."
Is nucleosome eviction ATP-dependent?,yes,"ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and nucleosome-depleted 'barriers' co-operate to determine the kinetics of nucleosome organization ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling factors endow chromatin with structural flexibility by promoting assembly or disruption of nucleosomes and the exchange of histone variants. remodeling takes place in an ATP-independent manner. Binding of distamycin to the linker and nucleosomal DNA culminates in eviction of the linker histone and the formation of a population of off-centered nucleosomes. which promotes histone deposition onto DNA, and a novel activity, which prevents nucleosome eviction but not remodeling mediated by the ATP-dependent RSC complex ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF regulates transcription and has been implicated in promoter nucleosome eviction ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling enzyme involved in transcription, replication, and the DNA damage response Iec1-Ino80 complex promotes transcription through nucleosome eviction Ino80 complex from fission yeast mediates ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling in vitro reconstitution of nucleosome disassembly using the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Rsc and Vps75 revealed that these proteins can cooperate to remove H2A/H2B dimers from nucleosomes.

Aren't epigenetic modifications implicated in cardiovascular development and disease?,no,"Gene expression regulation through the interplay of DNA methylation and histone modifications is well-established, although the knowledge about the function of epigenetic signatures in cardiovascular disease is still largely unexplored. The study of epigenetic markers is, therefore, a very promising frontier of science which may aid in a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of gene expression in the biomolecule pathways linked to cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights our current knowledge of epigenetic gene regulation and the evidence that chromatin remodeling and histone modifications play key roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease through (re)programming of cardiovascular (stem) cells commitment, identity and function. Notably, multiple subunits of switching defective/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes have been identified as strong candidates underlying these defects because they physically and functionally interact with cardiogenic transcription factors critical to cardiac development, such as TBX5, GATA-4, and NKX2-5. While these studies indicate a critical role of SWI/SNF complexes in cardiac development and congenital heart disease, many exciting new discoveries have identified their critical role in the adult heart in both physiological and pathological conditions involving multiple cell types in the heart, including cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and neural crest cells. Recent studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the regulation of cardiovascular development at the chromatin level, including the remodeling of chromatin and the modification of histones. Chromatin-level regulation integrates multiple inputs and coordinates broad gene expression programs. Thus, understanding chromatin-level regulation will allow for a better appreciation of gene regulation as a whole and may set a fundamental basis for cardiovascular disease. Genetic and epigenetic factors are of great importance in cardiovascular biology and disease. Tobacco-smoking, one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors, is itself partially determined by genetic background and is associated with altered epigenetic patterns. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification (acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation) and miRNA, are critical for regulating developmental events. However, aberrant epigenetic mechanisms may lead to pathological consequences such as cardiovascular disease (CAD), neurodegenerative disease, obesity, metabolic disorder, bone and skeletal diseases and various cancers. Cardiovascular disease pathways are now being approached from the epigenetic perspective, including those associated with atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, ischemia-reperfusion damage, and the cardiovascular response to hypoxia and shear stress, among many others. With increasing interest and expanding partnerships in the field, we can expect new insights to emerge from epigenetic perspectives of cardiovascular health. Epigenetic modifications are heritable alterations of the genome, which can govern gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. The purpose of this review is to render an overview of the possible mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in response to environmental pollutants leading to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). From varied study approaches directed either toward the general understanding of the key pathway regulatory genes, or sampling population cohorts for global and gene-specific changes, it has been possible to identify several epigenetic signatures of environmental exposure relevant to CVD. An understanding of chromatin remodelling in response to environmental stimuli conducive to CVD is emerging, with the promise of novel diagnostic and therapeutic candidates. Consolidated knowledge is accumulating as to the role of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of vascular development and vascular tone as well as in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The modulation of gene expression through modification of the epigenome by structural changes of the chromatin architecture without alterations of the associated genomic DNA sequence is part of the cellular response to environmental changes. Such environmental conditions, which are finally being translated into adaptations of the cardiovascular system, also comprise pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction.  Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Histone modifications lead to the modulation of the expression of genetic information through modification of DNA accessibility. In addition, RNA-based mechanisms (e.g., microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) influence the development of disease. We here outline the recent work pertaining to epigenetic changes in a cardiovascular disease setting. Epigenetics may represent one of the possible scientific explanations of the impact of such intrauterine risk factors for the subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) during adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA alterations, which collectively enable the cell to respond quickly to environmental changes. A number of CVD risk factors, such as nutrition, smoking, pollution, stress, and the circadian rhythm, have been associated with modification of epigenetic marks. Further examination of these mechanisms may lead to earlier prevention and novel therapy for CVD.  Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic alterations are associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease Epigenetic mechanisms that underpin metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Epigenetic regulation of cardiovascular differentiation. Epigenetic control mechanisms play a key role in the regulation of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis and modulate cardiovascular diseases."
Is there any protein that undergoes both mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination?,yes,"The yeast G protein alpha subunit Gpa1 represents a rare example of a protein that undergoes both mono- and poly-ubiquitination.  Expression of p34 promotes PTEN poly-ubiquitination, leading to PTEN protein degradation, whereas p34 knockdown results in PTEN mono-ubiquitination. These fingers possess E3 activities of mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination, respectively, with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-binding capabilities.  Instead of promoting poly-ubiquitination and degradation, we show that Smurf2 actually induces multiple mono-ubiquitination of Smad3 in vivo. mono-ubiquitination of CIITA dramatically increases its transactivity whereas poly-ubiquitination leads to CIITA degradation. This leads to a model in which Lys134 of LDB1 can be either mono-ubiquitinated, leading to stabilization, or poly-ubiquitinated, leading to degradation by the proteasome pathway.   mono-ubiquitination of CIITA increases its transactivity, whereas poly-ubiquitination of CIITA leads to its degradation PS1 ubiquitination after PI3K inhibition is represented by the multiple mono-ubiquitination, instead of poly-ubiquitination Our observations support a novel functional relationship between parkin and Hsc/Hsp70 and support the notion that parkin is a multi-purpose E3 ubiquitin ligase capable of modifying proteins either via attachment of alternatively linked poly-ubiquitin chains or through multiple mono-ubiquitination to achieve alternate biological outcomes our results indicate that Hsp70 facilitates CHIP-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Smad1 whereas it attenuates CHIP-meditated mono-ubiquitination of Smad1. Whereas poly-ubiquitination targets protein substrates for proteasomal degradation, mono-ubiquitination is known to regulate protein trafficking in the endosomal system and to target cargo proteins for lysosomal degradation. Our results suggest that oxidative stress induces not only poly-ubiquitination but also mono-ubiquitination of LDH-A, which may be involved in its lysosomal degradation during unloading. wild type Smad4 is a relatively stable protein that undergoes mono- or oligo-ubiquitination, a modification not linked to protein degradation These data suggest that oligo-ubiquitination positively regulates Smad4 function, whereas poly-ubiquitination primarily occurs in unstable cancer mutants and leads to protein degradation. We found that Ro52 was strongly conjugated by a single molecule of ubiquitin in cells. Although the biological relevance of this mono-ubiquitination was not defined, the function of Ro52 might be modified by the mono-ubiquitination. We also found that Ro52 was conjugated with poly-ubiquitin chain in cells (poly-ubiquitination)"
Couldn't Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?,no,"Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a type of cardiac arrhythmia that occurs in people with a structurally normal heart. Stress or anxiety-induced release of endogenous catecholamines causes a dysfunction in the myocytic calcium-ion channel, leading to ventricular arrhythmias that can cause dizziness, syncope, or sudden cardiac death.  During a follow-up of 48±94 months, arrhythmia events (sudden cardiac death and aborted cardiac arrest) associated with noncompliance occurred in 2 patients.  We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryanodine receptor.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS), leave no evidence to be found at autopsy a spectrum of sudden cardiac death (SCD)-predisposing heritable cardiac arrhythmia syndromes, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  CPVT is a familial arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by abnormal calcium (Ca(2+)) handling, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death Mutations in RyR2 are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and sudden cardiac death. Patients with CPVT often present with exercise- or emotion induced syncope, the first presentation can also be sudden cardiac death. Among the five major arrhythmogenic disorders occurring in the absence of a structural heart disease is catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which is a highly lethal form of inherited arrhythmias.  Patients with CPVT are at high risk of developing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when untreated.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by VT induced by adrenergic stress in the absence of structural heart disease and high incidence of sudden cardiac death.  CPVT is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by gene mutations that destabilize cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels. Sudden cardiac death is incompletely prevented by conventional drug therapy with β-blockers with or without Ca(2+) channel blockers.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) are primary inherited arrhythmia syndromes that may cause syncope and sudden cardiac death in young individuals.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder that causes syncopal episodes related with stress or emotion and even sudden cardiac deaths. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia caused by mutations in the RyR2 gene manifests as severe arrhythmias, and may provide a candidate for sudden cardiac deaths. Patients diagnosed with an electrical cardiomyopathy have an increased risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD).  Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms.  Over 80% of SCD occurs in patients with organic heart disease. However, approximately 10-15% of SCD occurs in the presence of structurally normal heart and the majority of those patients are young. In this group of patients, changes in genes encoding cardiac ion channels produce modification of the function of the channel resulting in an electrophysiological substrate of VA and SCD. Collectively these disorders are referred to as Cardiac Ion Channelopathies. The 4 major syndromes in this group are: The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), the Brugada Syndrome (BrS), the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS), and the Catecholaminergic Polymorphic VT (CPVT).  Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (CPVT).  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. It occurs in patients with structurally normal heart and causes exercise-emotion-triggered syncope and sudden cardiac death. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) Aberrant spontaneous, diastolic Ca2+ leak from the SR due to dysfunctional RyR2 contributes to the formation of delayed after-depolarisations, which are thought to underlie the fatal arrhythmia that occurs in both heart failure (HF) and in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Mutations in RyR2 have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a heritable arrhythmia unmasked by exertion or stress, characterized by triggered activity and sudden cardiac death in affected patients. families that exhibit CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), a condition in which physical or emotional stress can trigger severe tachyarrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. that often leads to sudden death in HF and in CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited disease characterized by adrenergically mediated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia leading to syncope and sudden cardiac death. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by adrenergic induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardias and associated with sudden cardiac death.  These data suggest that ""leaky"" RyR2 channels can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias, providing a possible explanation for CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by syncopal events and sudden cardiac death at a young age during physical stress or emotion, in the absence of structural heart disease.   catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) account for a relevant proportion of sudden cardiac death cases in young patients cohorts.  has recently been shown to be involved in at least two forms of sudden cardiac death (SCD): (1) Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)"

Does MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) contribute to cardiovascular disease?,yes,"The synergistic effect of miR-21 and miR-1 were functionally validated for their significant influences on myocardial apoptosis, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Taken together, we found a novel reciprocal loop between miR-21 and TGFβRIII in cardiac fibrosis caused by myocardial infarction in mice, and targeting this pathway could be a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of myocardial remodeling. It is still controversial whether microRNA-21 (miR-21) participates in the process of cardiac fibrosis. In mice, myocardial miR-21 overexpression is related to cardiac fibrosis elicited by pressure overload.  The myocardial and plasma levels of miR-21 were significantly higher in the AS patients compared with the controls and correlated directly with the echocardiographic mean transvalvular gradients. Our results support the role of miR-21 as a regulator of the fibrotic process that occurs in response to pressure overload in AS patients and underscore the value of circulating miR-21 as a biomarker for myocardial fibrosis. Ad-miR-21 improves LV remodeling and decreases the apoptosis of myocardial cells, suggesting the possible mechanism by which Ad-miR-21 functions in protecting against I/R injury. In the Ad-miR-21 group, LV dimensions, myocardial infarct size, LV/BW, collagen type Ⅰ, type Ⅲ and PCNA positive cells all significantly decreased compared with the Ad-GFP group. While miR-21, -133, -150, -195, and -214 regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, miR-1/-133 and miR-208 have been elucidated to influence myocardial contractile function. In addition, miR-21, -24, -133, -210, -494, and -499 appear to protect myocytes against I/R-induced apoptosis, whereas miR-1, -29, -199a, and -320 promote apoptosis. Myocardial fibrosis can be regulated by the miR-29 family and miR-21. The small regulatory RNA microRNA-21 (miR-21) plays a crucial role in a plethora of biological functions and diseases including development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and inflammation. During recent years, additional roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, including cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis as well as myocardial infarction have been described. On the other hand, miR-21, miR-199a, miR-210, and miR-494 have been proven critical for the myocytes' adaptation and survival during hypoxia/ischemia.  Studies have shown that several miRs, including miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-126, miR-320, miR-92a, and miR-199a, are regulated after preconditioning and play an active role in protecting the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Studies using various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models have suggested the possible involvement of miR-1, miR-21, miR-29, miR-92a, miR-133, miR-199a, and miR-320 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. Recent studies have revealed that its expression is deregulated in heart and vasculature under cardiovascular disease conditions such as proliferative vascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. miR-21 is found to play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, cardiac cell growth and death, and cardiac fibroblast functions. Accordingly, miR-21 is proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above-mentioned cardiovascular diseases as demonstrated by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. This review article summarizes the research progress regarding the roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular disease. Remarkably, miR-21 was one of most upregulated miRNAs in hearts after IP. In vivo, IP-mediated cardiac protection against ischaemia/reperfusion injury was inhibited by knockdown of cardiac miR-21. In cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 also had a protective effect on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene, programmed cell death 4. The protective effect of miR-21 on cardiac cell apoptosis was further confirmed in rat hearts after ischaemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. Remarkably, miR-21 expression was significantly down-regulated in infarcted areas, but was up-regulated in border areas. The down-regulation of miR-21 in the infarcted areas was inhibited by ischemic preconditioning, a known cardiac protective method. Overexpression of miR-21 via adenovirus expressing miR-21 (Ad-miR-21) decreased myocardial infarct size by 29% at 24 h and decreased the dimension of left ventricles at 2 weeks after AMI. Using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 had a protective effect on ischemia-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene programmed cell death 4 and activator protein 1 pathway. The protective effect of miR-21 against ischemia-induced cardiac myocyte damage was further confirmed in vivo by decreased cell apoptosis in the border and infarcted areas of the infarcted rat hearts after treatment with Ad-miR-21. The results suggest that miRNAs such as miR-21 may play critical roles in the early phase of AMI. The results suggest that miR-21 is sensitive to H(2)O(2) stimulation. miR-21 participates in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and functional modulation in cardiac myocytes. miR-21 might play an essential role in heart diseases related to ROS such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts Myocardial and circulating levels of microRNA-21 reflect left ventricular fibrosis in aortic stenosis patients MicroRNA 21 inhibits left ventricular remodeling in the early phase of rat model with ischemia-reperfusion injury by suppressing cell apoptosis MicroRNA-21 protects against the H(2)O(2)-induced injury on cardiac myocytes via its target gene PDCD4 MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases MicroRNA-21 as therapeutic target in cancer and cardiovascular disease. These findings reveal that microRNAs can contribute to myocardial disease by an effect in cardiac fibroblasts. Our results validate miR-21 as a disease target in heart failure and establish the therapeutic efficacy of microRNA therapeutic intervention in a cardiovascular disease setting."
Don't selenoproteins and selenium play a role in prostate cancer prevention?,yes,"The selenoprotein-deficient mice exhibited accelerated development of lesions associated with prostate cancer progression, implicating selenoproteins in cancer risk and development and raising the possibility that selenium prevents cancer by modulating the levels of these selenoproteins Notably and in contrast to previous studies, RWPE-1 cells were significantly more sensitive to selenite than either of the prostate cancer cell lines. These results demonstrate that selenoproteins and selenium metabolism are regulated at multiple levels in prostate cells In a low-selenium population, SOD2-Ala16+ men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 are at an increased risk of prostate cancer/aggressive prostate cancer especially if ever-smokers, because they are likely to produce more mitochondrial H(2)O(2) that they cannot remove, thereby promoting prostate tumor cell proliferation and migration. Our results support a role of selenium and polymorphisms in selenoenzymes in prostate cancer etiology, which warrants confirmation in future studies. This study provides evidence that SEP15 genetic variation may influence PCa mortality. Additionally, the association of selenium with PCa mortality was modified by a variant, suggesting the possibility that some men with PCa may benefit more from selenium than others, depending on their genotype. We conclude that decreased SEPP concentration in serum might represent an additional valuable marker for prostate cancer diagnostics. The recently completed Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) was one of the largest human cancer prevention trials ever undertaken. Its purpose was to assess the role of selenium and vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention, but SELECT found no decline in prostate cancer. We studied Se levels in whole blood, plasma and prostate of 32 PC and 40 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients and in the control group composed of 39 healthy subjects. The selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was also measured in the patients' red cells, plasma and prostate tissue. Se concentration in whole blood and plasma in both groups of patients was lower as compared with controls, while in prostate gland it was significantly higher in PC than in BPH patients and controls. Red cell GSH-Px activity was the same in PC patients and controls but significantly lower in BPH patients. Of particular interest was the positive correlation between tissue GPx activity and Gleason score, with this relationship achieving statistical significance among African-Americans (r = 0.67, P = 0.02)"
Is adalimumab effective for hidradenitis suppurativa?,yes,"If patient is not improved, then Adalimumab 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2; then 40 mg subcutaneously weekly should be administered (LOE Ib, SOR A). If improvement occurs then therapy should be maintained as long as HS lesions are present. Reduction in pain scores and improvement in depressive symptoms in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa treated with adalimumab in a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Adalimumab treatment for 16 weeks improved HS lesions significantly versus placebo (NCT00918255). CONCLUSION: Patients with moderate to severe HS had a high degree of pain and depressive symptoms at baseline. Adalimumabtherapy was associated with decreased pain and depressive symptoms compared to baseline. Spotlight on adalimumab in the treatment of active moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa. Adalimumab, a recombinant, fully humanized, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) monoclonal antibody, is the only officially approved treatment for the management of moderate-to-severe HS. Case reports, concerning 42 patients who received adalimumab for severe HS (with the standard dose regimen for psoriasis), reported a cumulative response rate of 58% (≥50% in 23 patients) with a relapse rate of 71% (10 out of 14 patients). The most recent and most well-powered phase III, randomized placebo-controlled trials for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in treatment of moderate-to-severe HS (PIONEER studies I and II) showed that the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) rate at week 12 was significantly higher for patients randomized to adalimumab compared to placebo. In conclusion, adalimumab, to date, holds the most robust data regarding treatment efficacy in HS.  Adalimumab (Humira) for the Treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa. Adalimumab (Humira®) is a novel therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada, and the European Commission for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).

Aren't there any urine biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis?,no,"CONCLUSIONS: Several gene-based urinary biomarkers have demonstrated promise in initial studies, which now need to be rigorously validated in the clinical setting for them to be translated into clinically useful tests in diagnosis, surveillance or risk-stratification of bladder cancer  Novel promising markers are in various stages of clinical testing, and a panel of biomarkers may serve in the future as a feasible alternative to urine cytology and cystoscopy for the screening, detection, and follow-up of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. RESULTS: Seven of the 8 urine biomarkers were increased in subjects with bladder cancer relative to those without bladder cancer. The 7 biomarkers were assessed in a new model, which had an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.93), and 74% sensitivity and 90% specificity. The study provides further evidence that the reported panel of diagnostic biomarkers can reliably achieve the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer with higher sensitivity than currently available urine based assays. The urinary concentrations of 14 biomarkers (IL-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, SDC1, CCL18, PAI-1, CD44, VEGF, ANG, CA9, A1AT, OPN, PTX3, and APOE) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Diagnostic performance of each biomarker and multivariate models were compared using receiver operating characteristic curves and the chi-square test. An 8-biomarker model achieved the most accurate BCa diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 97%), but a combination of 3 of the 8 biomarkers (IL-8, VEGF, and APOE) was also highly accurate (sensitivity 90%, specificity 97%). For comparison, the commercial BTA-Trak ELISA test achieved a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 83%, and voided urine cytology detected only 33% of BCa cases in the same cohort. These data show that a multivariate urine-based assay can markedly improve the accuracy of non-invasive BCa detection : Histopathological grading of papillary urothelial tumors (PUTs) of the urinary bladder is subjective and poorly reproducible. We investigated the relationship between the expression of frequently deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as their target genes (ZEB1/ZEB2) and bladder cancer histopathological grade in an attempt to find a miRNA that might allow more reliable grading of PUTs. The Mcm5 immunoassay is a non-invasive test for identifying patients with urothelial cancers with similar accuracy to the FDA-approved NMP22 ELISA Test Kit. The combination of Mcm5 plus NMP22 improves the detection of UCC and identifies 95% of clinically significant disease. Trials of a commercially developed Mcm5 assay suitable for an end-user laboratory alongside NMP22 are required to assess their potential clinical utility in improving diagnostic and surveillance care pathways. HYAL-1 and HAS1 expression predicted BCa metastasis, and HYAL-1 expression also predicted disease-specific survival. Furthermore, the combined HAS2-HYAL-1 biomarker detected BCa and significantly predicted its recurrence. Cancer biomarkers are the backbone for the implementation of individualized approaches to bladder cancer (BCa).  Through genomic and proteomic profiling of urine, we have identified a panel of biomarkers associated with the presence of BCa. In this study, we evaluated the utility of three of these biomarkers, interleukin 8 (IL-8), Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and Syndecan in the diagnosis of BCa through urinalysis. METHODS: Voided urines from 127 subjects, cancer subjects (n = 64), non-cancer subjects (n = 63) were analyzed. The protein concentrations of IL-8, MMP-9, and Syndecan were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). . There was an association between differences in individual biomarkers and differences in protein levels over time, particularly in control patients. Collectively, our findings identify caveats intrinsic to the common practice of protein standardization in biomarker discovery studies conducted on urine, particularly in patients with hematuria"
Isn't the mouse Sry gene locus free of repetitive sequences?,yes,"We demonstrate that the presence of long inverted repeats (IR) flanking the mouse Sry gene leads to the formation of the Sry circular transcript in cultured cells Circularization requires the presence of both IR. As few as 400 complementary nt are necessary for this process The presence of the IR does not significantly stimulate intermolecular annealing and trans-splicing in vivo We have found that in an in vitro assay, the SRY protein binds to several sites of the Sry gene and especially to a (CA)25 sequence and to a (CAG)30 repeat The Q-rich domain of the mouse sex determining gene, Sry, is encoded by an in-frame insertion of a repetitive sequence composed of mostly CAG repeats. Inverted repeat structure of the Sry locus in mice. We performed separate amplifications of DXZ4 repetitive satellite sequences on the X chromosome, and SRY gene - testis determined factor on the Y chromosome, using nested PCR Detailed analysis of the Sry genomic locus reveals a further difference in that the mouse Sry open reading frame lies within 2.8 kilobases of unique sequence at the center of a large inverted repeat.  Detailed analysis of the Sry genomic locus reveals a further difference in that the mouse Sry open reading frame lies within 2.8 kilobases of unique sequence at the center of a large inverted repeat. The mouse genomic Sry locus is characterized by two arms of a large inverted repeat, flanking a unique region that, between an acceptor and a donor splice site, contains a single exon encoding the Sry protein. Recombination involving the repeat region may have led to an 11-kilobase deletion, precisely excising Sry in a line of XY female mice. Repetitive element analysis revealed numerous LINE-L1 elements at regions where conservation is lost among the Sry copies. Inverted repeat structure of the Sry locus in mice."
Don't have mutations in the GARS gene been identified to cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2D (CMT2D)?,no,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D is a hereditary axonal and glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS)-associated neuropathy that is caused by a mutation in GARS.  Mutations in the GARS gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2D and distal spinal muscular atrophy type V - allelic disorders characterized by predominantly distal upper extremity weakness and atrophy, typically beginning during the second decade of life.  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) is a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by missense mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase gene (GARS). The 13 genes known to be associated with the CMT2 subtypes are KIF1B (CMT2A1), MFN2 (CMT2A2), RAB7A (formerly RAB7) (CMT2B), LMNA (CMT2B1), MED25 (CMT2B2), TRPV4 (CMTC), GARS (CMT2D), NEFL (CMT2E/1F), HSPB1 (CMT2F), MPZ (CMT2I/J), GDAP1 (CMT2H/K), HSPB8 (CMT2L), and AARS (CMT2N).   The diagnosis of GARS-associated axonal neuropathy is based on clinical findings, electromyography (EMG), and molecular genetic testing of GARS, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase. Sporadic juvenile muscular atrophy of the distal upper extremity or Hirayama's disease (HD) and autosomal dominant motor distal neuronopathy/axonopathy (CMT2D/dSMA-V), produced by glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene mutations, share some clinical features including: young age of onset, predilection for the distal upper extremity, asymmetry, sparing of proximal muscles and unusual cold sensitivity.  Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V (dHMN-V) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) type 2 presenting with predominant hand involvement, also known as CMT2D and Silver syndrome (SS) are rare phenotypically overlapping diseases which can be caused by mutations in the Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy 2 (BSCL2) and in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase encoding (GARS) genes.  We previously implicated mutations in the gene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) as the cause of CMT2D and dSMA-V. Of the many inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathies, type 2D (CMT2D) is caused by dominant point mutations in the gene GARS, encoding glycyl tRNA synthetase (GlyRS).  Missense mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene have been recently reported in families with either dHMN-V, CMT2D, or both. Based on the presence or absence of sensory changes, the disease phenotype was initially defined as distal spinal muscular atrophy type V (dSMA-V) in three families, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) in a single family, and as either dSMA-V or CMT2D in patients of another large family. Linkage to chromosome 7p15 and the presence of disease-associated heterozygous GARS mutations have been identified in patients from each of the five studied families."
Aren't patients with Sjogren syndrome at increased risk for lymphoma?,no,"The heightened risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development in primary Sjogren syndrome (SS) is well established. Primary Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma of the Liver in a Patient with Sjogren Syndrome. Immunohistochemical and molecular features of the tumors allowed diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  To our knowledge, the patient described here represents the first reported case of DLBCL with primary liver involvement in SS. Rituximab is also effective in the treatment of SS-associated (extrasalivary) lymphomas, although the therapeutic response in salivary lymphoma is poorer. Rituximab treatment for Sjogren syndrome-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: case series. Five per cent of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) develop malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), usually of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and most frequently located in the major salivary glands.  [A case of Sjogren syndrome coexistent with MALT lymphoma occurring along the parotid gland and trachea]. Both histological examinations revealed MALT-type marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.  In the majority of patients, it is a late event and frequently associated with systemic disease or risk factors for lymphoma development. The incidence of lymphoma is higher in patients with Sjögren's syndrome than in the general population. Among the clinical and serological parameters that have been associated with lymphoma development in SS patients, the presence of palpable purpura, low C4, and mixed monoclonal cryoglobulinemia constitute the main predictive markers, and patients displaying these risk factors should be monitored closely. A case of pulmonary pseudolymphoma and Sjogren syndrome is presented. Furthermore, RA, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and possibly celiac disease may share an association with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in addition to well-established links of Sjögren's syndrome with risk of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and of celiac disease with risk of small intestinal lymphoma. Predicting the risk for lymphoma development in Sjogren syndrome: An easy tool for clinical use. Lymphoma is a very severe complication of primary Sjögren's syndrome: 5 to 10% of patients followed for more than 10 years will develop a lymphoma. Hematologic manifestations and predictors of lymphoma development in primary Sjögren syndrome: clinical and pathophysiologic aspects. Recent results clearly indicate an association between severity of chronic inflammation and lymphoma risk in RA and Sjögren's syndrome. Several autoimmune diseases, including primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), are associated with an increased risk for lymphoma. Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) confers increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development. Furthermore, we review the emerging role of ELS and lymphoid chemokines in driving extranodal B cell lymphomagenesis in SS and we focus on recent evidence suggesting that ELS identify subsets of SS patients at increased risk of developing systemic manifestations and lymphoma. Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder with the highest risk for lymphoma development among all autoimmune diseases. In contrast to secondary SS, the risk for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is highly increased in patients with primary SS. Predicting the risk for lymphoma development in Sjogren syndrome: An easy tool for clinical use. Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is complicated by B-cell lymphoma in 5-10% of patients. Patients with Sjögren syndrome are at increased risk of lymphoma development. Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease with a known predisposition for lymphoma development. Certain autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Sjögren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have consistently been associated with an increased risk of malignant lymphomas, but it is unclear whether elevated lymphoma risk is a phenomenon that accompanies inflammatory conditions in general."

Does molindone affect body weight?,yes,"Mean weight increased by 0.54 kg, and mean body mass index by 0.24 kg/m(2).  A large-scale trial comparing a first-generation antipsychotic (molindone) with newer agents did not find significant differences in treatment response, although the newer antipsychotics were associated with more severe weight gain.  No agent demonstrated superior efficacy, and all were associated with side effects, including weight gain.  The three treatment arms did not significantly differ in symptom decrease or time to discontinuation. Akathisia was more common with molindone and elevated prolactin concentrations more common with risperidone. Although weight gain and metabolic adverse events had occurred more often with olanzapine and risperidone during the acute trial, no significant between-drug differences emerged in most of these parameters during maintenance treatment.  Olanzapine and risperidone were associated with significantly greater weight gain. Olanzapine showed the greatest risk of weight gain and significant increases in fasting cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, insulin, and liver transaminase levels. Molindone led to more self-reports of akathisia.  Molindone is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but it does cause significantly more weight loss (2RCTs n=60 RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77).  Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic but its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics (apart from the event of weight loss).  Convergent evidence suggests a hierarchy in the magnitude of BWG that may be induced by diverse agents, being very high for clozapine and olanzapine; high for quetiapine, zotepin, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine; moderate for risperidone and sertindole; and low for ziprazidone, amisulpiride, haloperidol, fluphenazine, pimozide, and molindone.  Loxapine and molindone induce weight decreases, and these exceptions are difficult to explain. It is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but causes significantly more weight loss (RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99). Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic; however, its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics, apart from the event of weight loss.  Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a reduction of 0.39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3.19 kg with thioridazine. Weight gain has been reported with nearly every antipsychotic drug on the market (molindone is an exception).  Although almost all antipsychotics induce bodyweight gain, molindone and loxapine appear to induce bodyweight loss.  Clozapine and low-potency phenothiazines are associated with the largest gains and molindone with weight loss, but the mechanism is not known.  On average, molindone patients lost 5 pounds over the 6 weeks of treatment, whereas thioridazine patients gained 6 pounds.  Clinically, molindone has a tendency to cause weight loss and may have less effect on seizure threshold than conventional antipsychotic agents  Monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone, a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics, or other neuroleptic drugs. We found no significant differences in weight gain among the three groups.  The weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients. There was an average weight loss of 7.6 kg after 3 months on molindone; most of the loss occurred during the first month."
Doesn't cortical spreading depression appear in ischemic penumbra following ischemic stroke?,no,"During the subacute phase, the irreversible damage expands into the penumbra: multiple electrical and biological signals are triggered by periinfarct, spreading depression-like depolarizations leading to hypoxia and stepwise increase in lactate. Experimental and clinical studies indicate that waves of cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) appearing in the ischemic penumbra contribute to secondary lesion growth. Analysis of MCA occlusions (MCAOs) revealed a first CSD wave starting off during ischemic decline at the emerging core region, propagating concentrically over large portions of left cortex. Subsequent recurrent waves of CSD did not propagate concentrically but preferentially circled around the ischemic core. In the vicinity of the core region, CSDs were coupled to waves of predominantly vasoconstrictive CBF(LSF) responses, resulting in further decline of CBF in the entire inner penumbra and in expansion of the ischemic core. We conclude that CSDs and corresponding CBF responses follow a defined spatiotemporal order, and contribute to early evolution of ischemic territories. Astrocytes in the metabolically compromised ischemic penumbra-like area showed a long lasting swelling response to spontaneous spreading depolarizations despite rapid dendritic recovery in a photothrombotic occlusion model of focal stroke. Spontaneous spreading depolarizations (SDs) occur in the penumbra surrounding ischemic core. These SDs, often referred to as peri-infarct depolarizations, cause vasoconstriction and recruitment of the penumbra into the ischemic core in the critical first hours after focal ischemic stroke; however, the real-time spatiotemporal dynamics of SD-induced injury to synaptic circuitry in the penumbra remain unknown. We propose that metabolic stress resulting from recurring SDs facilitates acute injury at the level of dendrites and dendritic spines in metabolically compromised tissue, expediting penumbral recruitment into the ischemic core. Although the mechanism remains unknown, SDs show delayed electrophysiological recovery within the ischemic penumbra. Spreading depression-like peri-infarct depolarizations not only characterize but also worsen penumbra conditions in cortical border zones of experimental focal ischemia. We conclude that in focal ischemia, transient peri-infarct depolarizations emerge not only in cortical but also in striatal gray matter, thereby demonstrating the existence of subcortical zones of ischemic penumbra. Spreading depression (SD) has been demonstrated following focal ischemia, and the additional workload imposed by SD on a tissue already compromised by a marked reduction in blood flow may contribute to the evolution of irreversible damage in the ischemic penumbra. While the changes in the glucose-related metabolites persisted during recovery even in anterior portions of the cortex in both groups in the aftermath of the SD, the magnitude of the changes was greater in the penumbra than in the normal cortex. SD appears to impose an equivalent increase in energy demands in control and ischemic brain, but the ability of the penumbra to recover from the insult is compromised. Thus, increasing the energy imbalance in the penumbra after multiple SDs may hasten the deterioration of the energy status of the tissue and eventually contribute to terminal depolarization and cell death, particularly in the penumbra. It is suggested that the limited survival of the penumbra is due to periinfarct depolarizations, which result in repeated episodes of tissue hypoxia, because the increased metabolic workload is not coupled to an adequate increase of collateral blood supply. Transient decreases of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water as measured by fast diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the ischemic border zone are thought to reflect cellular swelling associated with spreading depression. Severely delayed recovery time after spreading depression is thought to represent the ischemic penumbra. One current but controversial hypothesis is that this penumbra tissue often eventually dies because of the metabolic stress imposed by multiple cortical spreading depression (CSD) waves, that is, by ischemic depolarizations. After simulated infarction, the model displays the linear relation between final infarct size and the number of CSD waves traversing the penumbra that has been reported experimentally, although damage with each individual wave progresses nonlinearly with time. These findings support the hypothesis that CSD waves play an important causal role in the death of ischemic penumbra tissue. MCAO also triggers periodic periinfarction depolarizing waves (PIDs) in the ischemic penumbra, the territory of salvage. Here, the effects of SD at reduced flow conditions as encountered in the ischemic penumbra are examined. The experiments illustrate how peri-infarct depolarizations may detrimentally affect the penumbra. In the second series of experiments, periinfarct depolarizations (PIDs) were recorded with an extracellular DC electrode at two locations in the ischemic penumbra for the initial 3 h following MCAO. In vivo two-photon microscopy of green fluorescent protein-expressing neurons in this penumbra-like area at risk revealed that SDs were temporally correlated with rapid (<6 s) dendritic beading."
Isn't POLD3 essential for mouse development?,no,"The Pold3 gene encodes a subunit of the Polδ DNA polymerase complex. Pold3 orthologs are not essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or chicken DT40 cells, but the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ortholog is essential. POLD3 also has a specialized role in the repair of broken replication forks, suggesting that POLD3 activity could be particularly relevant for cancer cells enduring high levels of DNA replication stress. We report here that POLD3 is essential for mouse development and is also required for viability in adult animals. We report here that POLD3 is essential for mouse development and is also required for viability in adult animals.

Isn't thrombophilia related to increased risk of miscarriage?,no,"Thrombophilia does hardly increase the risk of IUGR/PMPC or if so, it can be prevented by LMWH for illustrative purposes, a patient presenting with combined thrombophilia--both genetic and acquired--will be discussed. This patient had suffered severe gestational complications that led to devastating obstetrical outcome Thrombophilias have been implicated in complications related to ischemic placental disease including recurrent pregnancy loss, intrauterine fetal demise, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and preterm delivery Further information about the combined risk of aPC resistance and pregnancy is needed before guidance on the management of affected women can be formulated. Thrombotic risk during pregnancy and the puerperium is higher in asymptomatic women with than without thrombophilia Further studies are required to assess the thrombotic risk in women with preeclampsia as well as early or late recurrent pregnancy loss. Risk of pregnancy-related venous thrombosis in carriers of severe inherited thrombophilia In conclusion, homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and, to a lesser extent, double heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and of the prothrombin mutation have an increased risk of venous thrombosis during pregnancy, particularly high during the postpartum period Careful diagnosis, observation and monitoring can add significant benefit to LMWH therapy during pregnancy Pregnancy in healthy women is accompanied by hypercoagulable changes that may interact with thrombophilia risk factors and threaten pregnancy. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies) mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the postpartum period When counseling white women with a history of preeclampsia, screening for thrombophilia can be useful for preconceptional counseling and pregnancy management. knowledge combined with the appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis and treatment in women who have objectively confirmed VTE continue to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes The risk of having thrombophilia is doubled in men who have fathered pregnancies which ended in perinatal death as well as in the mothers of such pregnancies. The prevalence of thrombophilic variants is of possible public health significance for other morbidity; but perhaps not in relation to preeclampsia This study suggests that thrombophilia ""mediates"" in lowering of cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia"
Are there any specific antidotes for dabigatran?,no,"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)--apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban--have a significantly smaller risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs.  However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect. Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications; Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  The lack of guidelines, protocols, and an established specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran potentially increases the rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with closed head injury (CHI). The novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran etexilat (Pradaxa®), rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) and apixaban (Eliquis®), also known as ""direct"" anticoagulants, act independently from antithrombin by inhibiting thrombin, as in the case of dabigatran, or by inhibiting factor Xa, as in the case of rivaroxaban and apixaban. It is assumed that they are suitable for long-term use and do not require laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, clinical experience is very limited and caution rather than quick conclusions is necessary. Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes.  NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication.  It is critical to identify and subsequently manage dabigatran etexilate toxicity because there is no specific antidote to reverse the drug's anticoagulant effects. In the absence of a specific antidote for this novel oral anticoagulant medication, even in an emergency situation, successful surgical treatment was possible with an aggressive use of available prohaemostatic agents. While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in ""real-life"" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  As there is no specific antidote, the only treatment option is discontinuation of the drug and supportive management. Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. Although there is no specific antidote to antagonise the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, due to its short duration of effect drug discontinuation is usually sufficient to reverse any excessive anticoagulant activity."
Don't circRNAs remain untranslated?,yes,"We demonstrate that the circular RNA circ-Foxo3 was highly expressed in non-cancer cells and were associated with cell cycle progression Ectopic expression of circ-Foxo3 repressed cell cycle progression by binding to the cell cycle proteins cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (also known as cell division protein kinase 2 or CDK2) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (or p21), resulting in the formation of a ternary complex. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that act by direct base pairing to target sites within untranslated regions of messenger RNAs. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. This study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a naturally expressed circRNA. Numerous circRNAs were specifically expressed at different lactation stages, and only 1,314 circRNAs were detected at both lactation stages. A significantly positive correlation was observed for the expression profiles of some circRNAs and their parent genes. The resulting circRNA can be translated to generate functional proteins. In total, 80 circRNAs were identified from these 4 genes; circRNAs from CSN1S1 had very high abundance, and 3 of them accounted for 36% of all the circRNAs expressed in the mammary gland on lactation d 90. A total of 4,804 and 4,048 circRNAs were identified in the cow mammary gland on d 90 and 250 postpartum, respectively, of which only 2,231 circRNAs were co-expressed at both lactation stages, suggesting high stage specificity in the circRNAs. Arraystar circRNA Microarray Technology (KANGCHEN, Shanghai, China) was used to analyze the differential expression of circRNAs. The aim of study was to identify circRNA expression in articular cartilage and to explore the function of chondrocyte extracellular matrix (ECM)-related circRNAs (circRNA-CER) in cartilage. We also validated that P. falciparum produces circRNAs, which is notable given the lack of RNA interference in the organism, and discovered that a highly expressed, five-exon antisense RNA is poised to regulate P. falciparum gametocyte development 1 (PfGDV1), a gene required for early sexual commitment events.

Isn't there any association of the chromosomal region harboring the gene ITIH3 with schizophrenia?,no,"The most widely shared subset of genes-common to five of six disorders-included ANK3, AS3MT, CACNA1C, CACNB2, CNNM2, CSMD1, DPCR1, ITIH3, NT5C2, PPP1R11, SYNE1, TCF4, TENM4, TRIM26, and ZNRD1.  Genome-wide significant associations in schizophrenia to ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8, and extensive replication of associations reported by the Schizophrenia PGC. After combining the new schizophrenia data with those of the PGC, variants at three loci (ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8) that had not previously been GWS in schizophrenia attained that level of support. In a joint analysis with a bipolar disorder sample (16,374 affected individuals and 14,044 controls), three loci reached genome-wide significance: CACNA1C (rs4765905, P = 7.0 × 10(-9)), ANK3 (rs10994359, P = 2.5 × 10(-8)) and the ITIH3-ITIH4 region (rs2239547, P = 7.8 × 10(-9)). Finally, a combined GWAS analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder yielded strong association evidence for SNPs in CACNA1C and in the region of NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4.  A recent genome-wide analysis indicated that a polymorphism (rs2535629) of ITIH3 showed the strongest association signal with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in Caucasian populations. We detected a novel association between suicide attempt and the ITIH3/4-region in a combined group of patients with BD, SCZ and related psychosis spectrum disorders.  These include variations in chromosomal structure at 16p11.2, rare de novo point mutations at the gene SCN2A, and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping near loci encoding the genes ITIH3, AS3MT, CACNA1C and CACNB2. These selected examples point to the challenges to current diagnostic approaches.  STAB1 is located in close proximity to PBMR1 and the NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4 region, which are the top findings from GWAS meta-analyses of mood disorder, and a combined BD and schizophrenia data set. Our findings suggest that rs2535629 influences the susceptibility to psychiatric disorders by affecting the expression level of GLT8D1."
Does BNP increase after intensive exercise in athletes?,yes,"NT-pro-BNP was significantly elevated postexercise in both adults and adolescents and remained above baseline at 24 h in both groups. NT-pro-BNP concentrations increased significantly (28 +/- 17.1 vs 795 +/- 823 ng x L, P < 0.05), whereas postrace cTnT were elevated in just five athletes (20%). [NT-pro-BNP] was observed immediately after the marathon (median [NT-pro-BNP] before: 39.6 pg ml(-1), after: 138.6 pg ml(-1), p=0.003) with a further increase on day one. [BNP] did not increase immediately after the marathon but increased on day one (median [BNP] before: 15 pg ml(-1), day one: 27.35 pg ml(-1), p=0.006). Pro-BNP was significantly increased immediately post-race (27+/-21 vs 7+/-2 pmol/L pre-race, P < or = 0.007), which 12-24 h later, decreased to 19+/-14 pmol/L (P = 0.07 vs pre-race). The relatively high NT-proBNP levels after active recovery when psychophysical stress is higher, because of cycling and cold water immersion, suggest that not only endurance exercise, but also strenuous, stressful short exercise can induce an increase in NT-proBNP concentrations. Running a marathon significantly increases NT-pro-BNP levels in healthy adults. This increase could be partially attributed to cardiac stress. Increases in NT-proBNP can be found in a major part of obviously healthy athletes after prolonged strenuous exercise. The release of BNP during and after exercise may not result from myocardial damage but may have cytoprotective and growth-regulating effects. The different nature of exercise-induced increases in BNP and cardiac troponins has to be elucidated in the future. In healthy cyclists, transient increases in NT-pro-BNP and cTnT are more likely to reflect cardiac fatigue than injury. The rise in BNP in older athletes may reflect a reversible, mainly diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.  Plasma BNP concentrations were higher in both the judo and marathon groups than in controls, and positively correlated with LV mass as well as with deceleration time. Such exercise significantly increased ANP and BNP levels in healthy men, and the increases could be partially attributed to myocardial damage during the race."
Are adenylyl cyclases always transmembrane proteins?,no,"ransmembrane adenylyl cyclase  Transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) and soluble AC (sAC)  Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is a recently recognized source of the signaling molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP) that is genetically and biochemically distinct from the classic G-protein-regulated transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs). Soluble adenylyl cyclase  transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs), and soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC).   Here, we showed that both transmembrane AC (tmAC) and soluble AC (sAC) are distinctly involved in the regulation of sperm motility in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis.  cAMP production in beta cells is mediated not simply by transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (TMACs), but also by sAC. In contrast to tmAC, sAC produces cAMP in various intracellular microdomains close to specific cAMP targets, e.g., in nucleus and mitochondria soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC, ADCY10), the ubiquitous, non-transmembrane adenylyl cyclase, was found to play a key role in neuronal survival and axon growth.

Is the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum always deadly?,no,"Animals treated with trace elements recovered. It appears that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and trace element deficiency could explain the extensive emergence of chronic Botulism. The patient was treated with human botulism immune globulin and had rapid recovery in weakness. A stool sample from the patient was positive for Type A Clostridium botulinum toxin eventually confirming the diagnosis of infant botulism The botulism immunoglobulin was administered, and a diagnosis was confirmed with positive botulinum toxin in the stool samples. Full recovery was made by the infant Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) serotype B (BoNT/B) is one of the serotypes of BoNT that causes deadly human botulism, though it is used clinically for treatment of many neuromuscular diseases. Foodborne botulism is a rare and sometimes fatal illness caused by consuming foods containing botulinum neurotoxin To assess the effectiveness and safety of botulinum toxin in treating MPS, excluding MPS in neck and head muscles. Botulinum toxin (BTX) is one of the most potent bacterial toxins known and its effectiveness in the treatment of some pain syndromes is well known.  An emerging treatment option to address these issues is the use of a paralyzing material such as botulinum toxin A (Botox) to decrease the appearance of the wrinkles, which yields a more esthetic and youthful facial appearanc lthough BoNT is an extremely toxic molecule, it is now increasingly used for the treatment of disorders related to muscle hyperactivity and glandular hyperactivity."
Are transcribed ultraconserved regions involved in cancer?,yes,"Although most cancer research has focused in mRNA, non-coding RNAs are also an essential player in tumorigenesis. In addition to the well-recognized microRNAs, recent studies have also shown that epigenetic silencing by CpG island hypermethylation of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) or small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), also occur in human neoplasia Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named 'hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients Consistent with the hypothesis that T-UCRs have important function in tumor formation The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition Expression levels of transcribed ultraconserved regions uc.73 and uc.388 are altered in colorectal cancer Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed. It has recently been proven in cancer systems that differentially expressed T-UCRs could alter the functional characteristics of malignant cells. Genome-wide profiling revealed that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemia and carcinoma  Our preliminary results suggest that uc.73 and uc.388 could be potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in CRC patients The transcribed-ultraconserved regions: a novel class of long noncoding RNAs involved in cancer susceptibility This review gives a picture of the state of the art of a novel class of long ncRNA known as transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Most recent studies show that they are significantly altered in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemias, carcinomas, and pediatric neuroblastomas, leading to the hypothesis that UCRs may play a role in tumorigenesis and promising innovative future T-UCR-based therapeutic approaches CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of non-coding RNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions in human cancer We focused on the transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), a subset of DNA sequences that are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes and that are located in both intra- and intergenic regions. We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal the possible existence of an aberrant epigenetic silencing pattern of T-UCRs by treating cancer cells with a DNA-demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray containing these sequences. We observed that DNA hypomethylation induces release of T-UCR silencing in cancer cells. Among the T-UCRs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, Uc.160+, Uc283+A and Uc.346+ were found to undergo specific CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues. The analysis of a large set of primary human tumors (n=283) demonstrated that hypermethylation of the described T-UCR CpG islands was a common event among the various tumor types. Our finding that, in addition to microRNAs, another class of ncRNAs (T-UCRs) undergoes DNA methylation-associated inactivation in transformed cells supports a model in which epigenetic and genetic alterations in coding and non-coding sequences cooperate in human tumorigenesis An integrative genomics screen uncovers ncRNA T-UCR functions in neuroblastoma tumours Different classes of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, have recently been implicated in the process of tumourigenesis. In this study, we examined the expression and putative functions of a novel class of non-coding RNAs known as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) in neuroblastoma our results define a T-UCR expression landscape in neuroblastoma and suggest widespread T-UCR involvement in diverse cellular processes that are deregulated in the process of tumourigenesis Moreover, the recent demonstration that other ncRNAs, the ultraconserved genes (UCGs) or transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), are involved in human cancerogenesis, suggests that the wider family of ncRNAs (including both miRNAs and UCGs) could contribute to the development of the malignant phenotype. Here we review the main studies investigating the role of miRNAs and UCRs in both normal hemopoiesis and hematological malignancies, and identify the molecular, clinical and therapeutic implications of these recent findings The transcribed-ultraconserved regions: a novel class of long noncoding RNAs involved in cancer susceptibility. Expression levels of transcribed ultraconserved regions uc.73 and uc.388 are altered in colorectal cancer. CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of non-coding RNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions in human cancer.

Aren't conserved noncoding elements associated with the evolution of animal body plans?,no,"Here, we discuss the evidence that CNEs are part of the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that specify alternative animal body plans. The major animal groups arose>550 million years ago. We propose that the cis-regulatory inputs identified by CNEs arose during the ""re-wiring"" of regulatory interactions that occurred during early animal evolution. Consequently, different animal groups, with different core GRNs, contain alternative sets of CNEs. Due to the subsequent stability of animal body plans, these core regulatory sequences have been evolving in parallel under strong purifying selection in different animal groups.

Is micro RNA 1 (miR-1) implicated in cardiac arrhythmias?,yes,"Dysfunction of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43), an established miR-1 target, during cardiac hypertrophy leads to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). miR-1 overexpression may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the heart to AVB, which provides us novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic cardiac arrhythmias. The incidence of AVB was higher in miR-1 Tg mice than that in wild-type (WT) mice.  As miR-1 has been shown in animal models and clinical studies to contribute to arrhythmogenesis by regulating pacemaker channel genes, our finding of miR-1 up-regulation in patients with myocardial infarction indicates that it might be responsible for the higher risk for arrhythmias in these patients.  Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) reciprocally regulates inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir)2.1 expression in coronary disease, contributing to arrhythmogenesis.  miR-1 levels are greatly reduced in human AF, possibly contributing to up-regulation of Kir2.1 subunits, leading to increased I(K1). Because up-regulation of inward-rectifier currents is important for AF maintenance, these results provide potential new insights into molecular mechanisms of AF with potential therapeutic implications. The muscle-specific miR-1 has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, heart development, cardiac stem cell differentiation, and arrhythmias through targeting of regulatory proteins.  We conclude that the beta-adrenergic pathway can stimulate expression of arrhythmogenic miR-1, contributing to ischaemic arrhythmogenesis, and beta-blockers produce their beneficial effects partially by down-regulating miR-1, which might be a novel strategy for ischaemic cardioprotection. MiR-1 influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure. In the presence of isoproterenol, rhythmically paced, miR-1-overexpressing myocytes exhibited spontaneous arrhythmogenic oscillations of intracellular Ca(2+), events that occurred rarely in control myocytes under the same conditions. Here we show that miR-1 is overexpressed in individuals with coronary artery disease, and that when overexpressed in normal or infarcted rat hearts, it exacerbates arrhythmogenesis. Elimination of miR-1 by an antisense inhibitor in infarcted rat hearts relieved arrhythmogenesis.  Thus, miR-1 may have important pathophysiological functions in the heart, and is a potential antiarrhythmic target.

Can Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) be used for gender selection?,yes,"This testing is used for identifying singlegene disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial disorders, gender selection in non-mendelian disorders with unequal gender distribution, aneuploidy screening, and other preconceptually identified genetic abnormalities in prospective parents.   Although many clinics offer PGD for HA by gender selection, an approach that detects the presence of the underlying F8 mutation has several advantages.  Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for gender selection for non-medical reasons has been considered an unethical procedure by several authors and agencies in the Western society on the basis that it could disrupt the sex ratio, that it discriminates against women and that it leads to disposal of normal embryos of the non-desired gender. In this study, the analysis of a large series of PGD procedures for gender selection from a wide geographical area in the USA shows that, in general, there is no deviation in preference towards any specific gender except for a preference of males in some ethnic populations of Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern origin that represent a small percentage of the US population.   In response to one specific question, one-third of the couples agreed to use the donor child as a lifetime organ donor and supported the use of PGD for non-medical gender selection.  More specifically, I illustrate how the prescriptions of deliberative democracy can be applied to the issue of regulating non-medical uses of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), such as gender selection.  Private clinics were more likely than other programs to be on either the East or West Coast, list certain PGD risks (e.g., diagnostic error), note that PGD was new or controversial, reference source of PGD information, provide accuracy rates of genetic testing of embryos, and offer gender selection for social reasons. The purpose of this article is to ascertain and appraise the ethical issues inherent to the utilisation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for gender selection in infertile patients anticipating undergoing a medically indicated assisted reproductive technique procedure. Performance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis per request specifically for gender selection by an infertile couple undergoing medically indicated assisted reproductive technique may not breach the principles of ethics, and is unlikely to alter the population balance of sexes. One possible use of PGD is to perform gender selection for couples whose offspring are at increased risk of disorders that do not follow Mendelian inheritance, but which are substantially more common in one sex than another (unequal sex incidence). Here, we examine the clinical and ethical issues to be considered prior to offering PGD gender selection to reduce the risk of a child being affected by a non-Mendelian condition with unequal sex incidence.  New uses of PGD have been reported in the past year for screening embryos for susceptibility to cancer, for late-onset diseases, for HLA-matching for existing children, and for gender.  This article describes current and likely future uses of PGD, and then analyses the ethical issues posed by new uses of PGD to screen embryos for susceptibility and late-onset conditions, for HLA-matching for tissue donation to an existing child, and for gender selection. The use of PGD for sex selection arouses considerable debate, especially in countries like India that have a marked cultural preference for boys. It is argued that using PGD for sex selection is a treatment option that can be ethically offered to couples who desire to use this technology to plan their families. Another concern is the use of this technology for nongenetic disorders such as gender selection."

Does CRISPR inversion of CTCF sites alter genome topology?,yes,"CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function.

Isn't Solanezumab effective for Alzheimer's Disease?,yes,"An analysis of publicly available data from the Phase II studies for bapineuzumab and solanezumab indicates that neither compound produced compelling evidence of drug-like behavior that would justify their progression into pivotal trials.  Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid β monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.  For example, Eli Lilly announced a major change to its closely watched clinical trial for the Alzheimer's drug solanezumab which failed to reach statistical significance.  Areas covered: This contradiction prompted us to review all study phases of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), Bapineuzumab, Solanezumab, Avagacestat and Dimebolin to shed more light on these recent failures.   Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing. Subsequent analysis of pooled data from both phase III trials with solanezumab showed a reduction in cognitive decline in patients with mild AD. Secondary analyses of EXPEDITION studies suggested a smaller functional effect of solanezumab relative to cognition. An increasing effect of solanezumab over 18 months was shown for cognition and function. RESULTS: In the mild AD population, less cognitive and functional decline was observed with solanezumab (n = 659) versus placebo (n = 663), measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale Instrumental ADLs.  The promising results obtained with aducanumab and solanezumab against Alzheimer's disease (AD) strengthen the vaccine approach to prevent AD, despite of the many clinical setbacks.  CONCLUSIONS: Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid, failed to improve cognition or functional ability.  Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing."

Does the hERG gene code for a protein which is part of a sodium channel?,no,"The human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG 1a) potassium channel is critical for cardiac repolarization Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels conduct delayed rectifier K(+) current.  The KvLQT1 and minK genes code the slowly activating, delayed rectifier (Iks) potassium channel, the HERG gene code the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier (Ikr) potassium channel of the heart, while the SCN5A gene codes a cardiac sodium channel. The molecular basis of inherited disorders caused by a mutation in either the gene coding for a particular potassium channel called HERG-or another gene, SCN5A, which codes for the sodium channel and disruption of which results in a loss of inactivation of the Na+ current. The aim of this study was to test whether a recently reported polymorphism in the HERG gene coding for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel has influence on myocardial repolarization. Mutations in KvLQT1, minK and HERG genes affects repolarising, rectifier potassium currents, while SCN5A mutations cause delayed inactivation and reopening of the cardiac sodium channel, which initiates the depolarisation of cardiac cells. A human genetic defect associated with 'long Q-T syndrome', an abnormality of cardiac rhythm involving the repolarization of the action potential, was recently found to lie in the HERG gene, which codes for a potassium channel. Therefore, matrine and oxymatrine may have the potential to cure LQT2 as a potassium channel activator by promoting hERG channel activation and increasing hERG channel expression.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome: hERG K+ channel block and disruption of protein trafficking by fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test whether a recently reported polymorphism in the HERG gene coding for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel has influence on myocardial repolarization.  The aim of this study was to test whether the K897T polymorphism of the KCNH2 (HERG) gene coding for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel influences cardiac repolarization assessed by principal component analysis (PCA) of T-wave morphology.  The KvLQT1 and minK genes code the slowly activating, delayed rectifier (Iks) potassium channel, the HERG gene code the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier (Ikr) potassium channel of the heart, while the SCN5A gene codes a cardiac sodium channel. All code for subunits of sodium or potassium channels: two a subunits of the potassium channels (QVLQT1 for LQT1, HERG for LQT2), the a subunit of the sodium channel INa (SCN5A for LQT3), and two regulatory subunits of potassium channels (KCNE1 for LQT5 regulating the KvLQT1 channel and MiRP1 regulating HERG). The corresponding genes code for potassium channels KVLQT1 (LQT1) and HERG (LQT2) and the sodium channel SCN5A (LQT3). The molecular basis of inherited disorders caused by a mutation in either the gene coding for a particular potassium channel called HERG-or another gene, SCN5A, which codes for the sodium channel and disruption of which results in a loss of inactivation of the Na+ current. There may also be correlation between the strength of binding of the medicinal substance to the potassium channel coded by the HERG gene and prolongation of the QT interval. We demonstrate that the mRNA 3'UTR of ppk29 affects neuronal firing rates and associated heat-induced seizures by acting as a natural antisense transcript (NAT) that regulates the neuronal mRNA levels of seizure (sei), the Drosophila homolog of the human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel.

Among the congenital forms, particularly interest is focused on the potassium channel coded by the HERG gene located on chromosome 7 and with a key role in the normal electric cardiac activity. By employing heterologous expression and making comparisons to cells expressing wild-type human-ether-a-go-go-related protein (HERG), a potassium channel that contributes to I(Kr) current in ventricular cardiomyocytes, we demonstrate activation of an elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by the mutant I593R HERG potassium channel implicated in long QT syndrome type 2.

Isn't statin use associated with improved outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?,no,"Statins have been shown in two recent small phase I/II trials to be associated with a marked reduction in clinical and transcranial Doppler (TCD) evidence of vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).  Statins did not result in reduced TCD velocities, clinical or angiographic vasospasm, or improvements in global outcome at the time of hospital discharge.  There remains significant uncertainty as to the role of statins in preventing vasospasm after SAH. Although the results of 2 randomized clinical trials demonstrated that statin decreases the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after aSAH, retrospective studies have failed to confirm this. There were no differences in the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (25.3 vs 30.5%; p = 0.277), in-hospital mortality rate (18 vs 15%; p = 0.468), length of hospitalization (21 +/- 15 vs 19 +/- 12 days; p = 0.281), or poor outcome at discharge (Glasgow Outcome Scale Scores 1-2: 21.7 vs 18.2%; p = 0.416) between the simvastatin and nonstatin cohorts.  The uniform introduction of simvastatin did not reduce the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, death, or poor outcome in patients with aSAH. Simvastatin was well tolerated, but its benefit may be less than has been previously reported. Cholesterol-reducing agents might improve unfavourable outcomes. We cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of lowering cholesterol in aneurysmal SAH because of insufficient reliable evidence from only one small trial. Experimental evidence has indicated the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There was an improvement in the functional outcome in the simvastatin group at 1, 3 or 6 months in the follow-up; however, this difference was not statistically significant.  There was benefit of simvastatin in terms of reduction in clinical vasospasm, mortality or improved functional outcome, however, this was not statistically significant. Cerebral vasomotor reactivity, however, is significantly improved after long-term statin administration in most patients with severe small vessel disease, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, or impaired baseline CA. Atorvastatin decreases computed tomography and S100-assessed brain ischemia after subarachnoid aneurysmal hemorrhage: a comparative study. In the overall population, cerebral vasospasm was significantly less common in the statin-treated group. Severity of vasospasm, as assessed on the most severe angiogram, was lowered with statin. Statins significantly reduced volume of ischemia in patients with vasospasm and an uncomplicated coiling procedure. S100B levels were significantly lower in statin-treated patients, and the decrease was greatest among high-grade patients (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 3-5). No differences were found between statin-treated and untreated groups regarding rescue therapy intensity or 1-yr clinical outcomes. Atorvastatin reduces the incidence, the severity and the ischemic consequences of vasospasm as assessed on computed tomography. In high-grade World Federation of Neurological Surgeons patients, atorvastatin decreases serum levels of S100B, a biomarker of brain ischemia. Despite these positive effects on biomarkers, no improvement of outcome was seen in the overall population, although there was a tendency for a better clinical outcome in high-grade patients. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been associated with improved clinical outcomes after ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage, but with an increased risk of incidental spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Statins are known to have pleiotropic vascular effects, some of which may interrupt the pathogenesis of DNDs. Based on promising preliminary reports, many clinicians routinely administer statins to prevent DNDs. However, observational studies have not revealed an association between statin-use and reduced DNDs or improved neurological outcomes. Results of RCTs have been inconsistent and limited by small sample size, but together suggest that statins may reduce DNDs, with no clear impact on mortality or neurological recovery. the role of statins in the management of patients with SAH remains unclear. Although promising, statins should not, at this time, be considered standard care. In patients with SAH, they may decrease the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, although the effects on overall outcome are less clear. Statins treatment may have potential clinical impact in vascular disease beyond cholesterol lowering. Its benefits have been documented in cerebral ischaemia and in subarachnoid haemorrhage. A recent meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of statin treatment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage reported a reduced incidence of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and mortality in statin-treated patients. The results of the present systematic review do not lend statistically significant support to the finding of a beneficial effect of statins in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as reported in a previous meta-analysis. Pre-treatment with cholesterol lowering drugs of the statin family may exert protective effects in patients with ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage but their effects are not clear in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).  Recently, two randomized controlled phase II studies showed that acute initiation of statin treatment directly after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) decreases the incidence of radiologic vasospasm and clinical signs of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and even reduces mortality. We conclude that both the primary and secondary outcome results of this study do not support a beneficial effect of simvastatin in patients with SAH. Novel uses of their anti-inflammatory properties in sepsis and vasomotor properties in subarachnoid haemorrhage are being further investigated by randomised trials. A trend towards a lower mortality within 14 days in patients receiving solely simvastatin and those receiving statin and magnesium as compared with the control group was found.  Initiation of statin therapy after aneurysmal SAH significantly reduces the incidence of vasospasm, delayed ischemic deficits, and mortality. The addition of statins to standard care was not associated with any reduction in the development of vasospasm or improvement in outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  We have previously demonstrated that acute pravastatin therapy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ameliorates vasospasm-related delayed ischemic deficits.  This trial demonstrates that acute statin treatment reduces traditional rescue therapy for vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Improvement in early outcome has proved robust at 6 months, particularly in relation to physical and psychosocial (Short Form 36) outcome. The authors previously have demonstrated that acute treatment with pravastatin after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can ameliorate vasospasm-related delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs). The neuroprotective effects of acute treatment with pravastatin following aneurysmal SAH are associated with enhancement of autoregulation Simvastatin reduces vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: results of a pilot randomized clinical trial. The use of simvastatin as prophylaxis against delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal SAH is a safe and well-tolerated intervention. Its use attenuates serum markers associated with brain injury and decreases the incidence of radiographic vasospasm and delayed ischemic deficit. Acute treatment with pravastatin after aSAH is safe and ameliorates cerebral vasospasm, improves cerebral autoregulation, and reduces vasospasm-related DID.  SAH statin users demonstrated significant improvement in 14-day functional outcome, a significantly lower incidence of DCI and cerebral infarctions of any type, as well as prevention of TCD highest mean velocity elevation. However, we did not find a significant statin impact on mortality or global outcome (Modified Rankin Scale) in this small sample."
Isn't there an increased risk for cancer in Dyskeratosis Congenita?,no,"People with DC are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis Clinical progression of the disease can lead to aplastic anemia (86% of all patients) and to pulmonary or hepatic complications. These patients also have an increased risk of cancer. Fanconi anaemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) comprise major inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). Adverse events include severe bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and solid tumours (ST) Patients with FA had earlier onset of cancers, need for stem cell transplant, and death; followed by DC; DBA and SDS were mildest. While FA and DC patients had markedly increased risks of cancer, AML and MDS, there were no cases of leukaemia in DBA or SDS patients The findings demonstrate that both FA and DC are major cancer susceptibility syndromes People with DC are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis Patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) have an increased risk of cancer, but also exhibit heightened radiation sensitivity. Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is characterized by the clinical triad of reticular skin pigmentation, oral leukoplakia, and nail dystrophy associated with bone marrow failure (BMF) and an high risk to develop cancer and pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare condition; however, it is vital to recognise the increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers in these patients. Point mutations in the DKC1 gene that encodes dyskerin cause the rare inherited syndrome called X-linked dyskeratosis congenita, characterized by a failure of proliferating tissues and increased susceptibility to cancer. Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) also known as Zinsser-Engman-Cole syndrome is a rare multi-system bone marrow failure syndrome characterised by mucocutaneous abnormalities and an increased predisposition to cancer"". Dyskeratosis congenita is an inherited syndrome characterised by mucocutaneous features, bone marrow failure, an increased risk of malignancy and other somatic abnormalities. Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare condition; however, it is vital to recognise the increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers in these patients. Epidermal atrophy, hair growth defects, bone marrow failure and increased risk of cancer are also common in DC patients. Telomere dysfunction and tumor suppression responses in dyskeratosis congenita: balancing cancer and tissue renewal impairment.

Is there any algorithm for enhancer identification from chromatin state?,yes,"RFECS: a random-forest based algorithm for enhancer identification from chromatin state. However, only a limited number of cell types or chromatin marks have previously been investigated for this purpose, leaving the question unanswered whether there exists an optimal set of histone modifications for enhancer prediction in different cell types. Here, we address this issue by exploring genome-wide profiles of 24 histone modifications in two distinct human cell types, embryonic stem cells and lung fibroblasts. We developed a Random-Forest based algorithm, RFECS (Random Forest based Enhancer identification from Chromatin States) to integrate histone modification profiles for identification of enhancers, and used it to identify enhancers in a number of cell-types. We show that RFECS not only leads to more accurate and precise prediction of enhancers than previous methods, but also helps identify the most informative and robust set of three chromatin marks for enhancer prediction. We developed a Random-Forest based algorithm, RFECS (Random Forest based Enhancer identification from Chromatin States) to integrate histone modification profiles for identification of enhancers, and used it to identify enhancers in a number of cell-types.

Is invasion and metastasis one of the hallmarks of cancer?,yes,"The pathogenesis of MM involves the accumulation of extensive cytogenetic changes, as well as cancer-related phenotypic alterations that facilitate tumor cell survival, invasion and metastasis. This review presents current knowledge regarding the biological characteristics of this disease that are linked to the so-called hallmarks of cancer."
Isn't microRNA(miRNA) 29 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,no,"Myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced remodelling generally includes cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), myocyte hypertrophy, angiogenesis, cardiac fibrosis, and myocardial dysfunction. I In addition, miR-21, -24, -133, -210, -494, and -499 appear to protect myocytes against I/R-induced apoptosis, whereas miR-1, -29, -199a, and -320 promote apoptosis Myocardial fibrosis can be regulated by the miR-29 family Studies using various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models have suggested the possible involvement of miR-1, miR-21, miR-29, miR-92a, miR-133, miR-199a, and miR-320 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction. Among the MI-regulated miRNAs are members of the miR-29 family, which are down-regulated in the region of the heart adjacent to the infarct. The miR-29 family targets a cadre of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in fibrosis, including multiple collagens, fibrillins, and elastin. Thus, down-regulation of miR-29 would be predicted to derepress the expression of these mRNAs and enhance the fibrotic response. Indeed, down-regulation of miR-29 with anti-miRs in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of collagens, whereas over-expression of miR-29 in fibroblasts reduces collagen expression. We conclude that miR-29 acts as a regulator of cardiac fibrosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for tissue fibrosis in general."
Isn't selumetinib effective in thyroid cancer?,no,"A phase I trial of vertical inhibition of IGF signalling using cixutumumab, an anti-IGF-1R antibody, and selumetinib, an MEK 1/2 inhibitor, in advanced solid tumours. BACKGROUND: We completed a phase I clinical trial to test the safety and toxicity of combined treatment with cixutumumab (anti-IGF-1R antibody) and selumetinib (MEK 1/2 inhibitor). Two patients achieved a partial response (one unconfirmed), including a patient with BRAF wild-type thyroid carcinoma, and a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and six patients achieved time to progression of>6 months, including patients with thyroid carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab and MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib showed that the combination is safe and well-tolerated at these doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and pharmacodynamic evidence of target inhibition. MHC class I loss is a frequent mechanism of immune escape in papillary thyroid cancer that is reversed by interferon and selumetinib treatment in vitro. Increased antigenicity following selumetinib and IFN treatment warrants further study for immunotherapy of progressive PTC. The role of KIs in differentiated TC may be revolutionised by the finding that selumetinib may restore a clinical response to radioactive iodine (RAI).  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with current chemotherapy, selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, but combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with BRAF or KRAS mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. Selumetinib-enhanced radioiodine uptake in advanced thyroid cancer. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer.  Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease.  ECENT FINDINGS: For patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancers, sorafenib, selumetinib, pazopanib and sunitinib have been investigated with promising results.  Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. Here, selumetinib targets the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in papillary thyroid carcinoma and shows limited single-agent activity in the patients with tumors that harbor the (V600E)BRAF mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease."
Could DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases serve as tumour markers?,yes,"Here, we report evidence of the overexpression of DNA methyltransferases 3B (DNMT3B) in invasive cervical cancer and of the inhibition of metastasis by DNMT3B interference. This study was designed to determine the significance of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in DNA hypermethylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to identify DNA methylation markers in serum for the early diagnosis of ESCC. DNA methyltransferase 1 as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy in gastric cancer. We examined the prognostic and predictive impact of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and 3b expression in gastric carcinomas (GC) treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. High DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was found in 105/127 (83%) and 79/127 (62%) carcinomas, respectively. Tumoral DNMT3b mRNA up-regulation was significantly correlated with hypermethylation of multiple tumor-related genes (P=0.021). A regulator of de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, DNMT3L promoter was found to have lost DNA methylation to varying levels in 14 out of 15 cancer cervix samples analysed. The present study highlights the importance of DNA methylation profile at DNMT3L promoter not only as a promising biomarker for cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, but also provides insight into the possible role of DNMT3L in cancer development. DNMT3L is a novel marker and is essential for the growth of human embryonal carcinoma. Among the DNMT genes, we found that mRNA for DNMT3L was specifically expressed in TGCTs, but neither in normal testicular tissues nor in cancer cells of somatic tissue origin. DNMT3L protein was strongly expressed in two EC cell lines, but not in the cell lines of somatic tissue origin. Positive nuclear labeling for DNMT3a was found only in few neoplasms: 1 pleomorphic adenoma (9.0%), 2 adenoid cystic carcinoma (16.6%) and 1 mucoepidermoid (9.0%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results were not able to demonstrate a clear correlation between DNMT1 and DNMT3a immunoexpression and salivary gland neoplasms development. DNA methylation, mediated by the combined action of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), is essential for mammalian development and is a major contributor to cellular transformation. The prevalence, the prognostic effect, and interaction with other molecular markers of DNMT3A mutations was studied in 415 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger than 60 years. The recent identification of DNMT3A mutations in de novo acute myeloid leukemia prompted us to determine their frequency, patterns and clinical impact in a cohort of 98 patients with either therapy-related or secondary acute myeloid leukemia developing from an antecedent hematologic disorder. DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were also decreased in vorinostat-treated A549 cancer cells. To identify the mechanisms responsible for these genome-wide DNA methylation alterations, we measured the gene expression levels of several DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and their interacting proteins by TaqMan qPCR and observed increased expression of DNMT3A2, DNMT3B, and EZH2 in tumors. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is the primary enzyme that maintains DNA methylation. 5-Azactydine inhibits cell growth by direct cytotoxic action as well as by inhibition of DNA methyl transferase enzyme. Alterations in metabolism of methyl donors, disturbances in activity and/or expression of DNA methyltransferases, and presence of DNA single-strand breaks could contribute to the loss of cytosine methylation during carcinogenesis; however, the precise mechanisms of genomic hypomethylation induced by chemical carcinogens remain largely unknown. Recently, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DNMT3B promoter region, C46359T (-149C>T), -283T>C, and -579G>T have also been reported to be stratification markers that can predict an individual's susceptibility to cancers. Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play important roles during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs. Thus, tumour subsets exist that display concurrent decreased BRCA1 expression, BRCA1 promoter methylation, cytoplasmic CTCF expression and with DNMT3b over-expression. DNA methylation patterns in genome are maintained during replication by a DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play an important role during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs. To investigate the relationship between the expression of DNMT and clinical prognosis in adult patients with acute leukemia (AL), the mRNA expressions of DNMT, p15(INK4B), mdr1 were measured in 72 AL patients and 20 normal controls by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the ratio of p15 CpG land methylation was measured in 56 AL patients and 14 normal controls by methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR). DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 ensures clonal transmission of lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns in a mammalian genome during replication. Overexpression of the major DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is cytotoxic and has been hypothesized to result in aberrant hypermethylation of genes required for cell survival. DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays an important role in the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns via complicated networks including signaling pathways and transcriptional factors, relating to cell differentiation or carcinogenesis. We evaluated the significance of aberrant DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein expression during gastric carcinogenesis."
Could divalent metal transporter 1 deficiency lead to anemia?,yes,"The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a major iron transporter required for iron absorption and erythropoiesis. Loss of DMT1 function results in microcytic anemia.  Dysfunction of human DMT1 is associated with several pathologies such as iron deficiency anemia hemochromatosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as colorectal cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma, making DMT1 an attractive target for drug discovery. Deficiency of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) leads to hypochromic microcytic anemia. We have previously shown that DMT1 deficiency impairs erythroid differentiation and induces apoptosis of erythroid cells.  We propose that DMT1 deficiency negatively affects metabolism and life span of mature erythrocytes; two other aspects of defective erythropoiesis which contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Hypochromic microcytic anemia associated with ineffective erythropoiesis caused by recessive mutations in divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) can be improved with high-dose erythropoietin supplementation.  Belgrade rats exhibit microcytic, hypochromic anemia and systemic iron deficiency due to a glycine-to-arginine mutation at residue 185 in a metal ion transporter of a divalent metal transporter/divalent cation transporter/solute carrier 11 group A member 2 or 3 (DMT1/DCT1/SLC11A2), a member of the natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) family.

Microcytic anemia (mk/mk) mice defective in DMT1 and wild-type mice were exposed to either bleomycin or saline via intratracheal instillation and the resultant lung injury was compared.  Deficiency of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) leads to hypochromic microcytic anemia. The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a major iron transporter required for iron absorption and erythropoiesis. This mutation severely impairs the iron transport capability of DMT1, leading to systemic iron deficiency and anemia."
Doesn't Rad9 interact with Aft1 in S.cerevisiae?,no,"Rad9 interacts with Aft1 to facilitate genome surveillance in fragile genomic sites under non-DNA damage-inducing conditions in S. cerevisiae. Here we show that Rad9 checkpoint protein, known to mediate the damage signal from upstream to downstream essential kinases, interacts with Aft1 transcription factor in the budding yeast. Aft1 regulates iron homeostasis and is also involved in genome integrity having additional iron-independent functions. Using genome-wide expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, we found Rad9 to be recruited to 16% of the yeast genes, often related to cellular growth and metabolism, while affecting the transcription of ∼2% of the coding genome in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. Importantly, Rad9 is recruited to fragile genomic regions (transcriptionally active, GC rich, centromeres, meiotic recombination hotspots and retrotransposons) non-randomly and in an Aft1-dependent manner. Further analyses revealed substantial genome-wide parallels between Rad9 binding patterns to the genome and major activating histone marks, such as H3K36me, H3K79me and H3K4me. Thus, our findings suggest that Rad9 functions together with Aft1 on DNA damage-prone chromatin to facilitate genome surveillance, thereby ensuring rapid and effective response to possible DNA damage events.

Can't desvenlafaxine be used at a dose of 50mg/day?,no,"Long-term use of desvenlafaxine was safe and well tolerated, with a clinical benefit/risk profile similar to that in other populations. e objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of desvenlafaxine for continuation treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Japanese patients. This was a phase 3, multicenter, 10-month, open-label study with flexible dosing of desvenlafaxine (25, 50, 100 mg/day) n an effort to establish the lowest effective dose of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), we assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 10- and 50-mg/day desvenlafaxine vs placebo for the treatment of major depressive disorder Change from baseline to final evaluation in adjusted HAM-D(17) total scores was not significantly different comparing desvenlafaxine 10 mg/day (-9.28) and desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day (-8.92) with placebo (-8.42) Overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events with both doses were similar to placebo However, in a companion study reported separately, desvenlafaxine 50 mg, but not 25 mg, separated from placebo. Taken together, these studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.  Desvenlafaxine XR was dosed at 50 mg/day for 10 days. Desvenlafaxine therapy is initiated at the therapeutic dose (50 mg/day) without a need for dose titration. Clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of DVS in doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/day for the treatment of MDD in adult outpatients. The effects of DVS 50 mg/day have been clearly distinguished from placebo in the reduction of MDD symptoms in such clinical trials. No additional therapeutic benefits were found at doses > 50 mg/day. The recommended dose of DVS ranges from 50 to 100 mg. Adult outpatients with major depressive disorder received desvenlafaxine doses ranging from 50-400 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks  At the recommended therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day, discontinuation due to adverse events was similar to placebo atients received fixed (50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/day; n=1,342) or flexible doses (100-400 mg/day; n=463) of desvenlafaxine or placebo (n=1,108) Desvenlafaxine demonstrated short-term efficacy for treating major depressive disorder across the range of doses studied. No evidence of greater efficacy was observed with doses >50 mg/day; a strong dose-response effect on tolerability was observed. To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50- and 100-mg/day doses of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) MDD and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) scores > or =20 were randomly assigned to double-blind placebo or desvenlafaxine treatment (fixed dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Desvenlafaxine 50 mg was associated with a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline on the HAM-D(17) (-11.5) compared with placebo (-9.5, p=0.018)  These results demonstrate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day for treating MDD.  CONCLUSIONS: Desvenlafaxine at the recommended dose of 50 mg/d was effective in relapse prevention of depression during a 6-month period in patients who demonstrated stable response after 20 weeks of open-label desvenlafaxine treatment."
Can't canagliflozin cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis?,no,"CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking a combination of canagliflozin and metformin who presented with progressive altered mental status over the previous 2 days. Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose>500 mg/dL and ketones of 80 mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93 mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids, and the metabolic abnormalities and her altered mental status resolved within 36 h. This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis. Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis.  Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis with Persistent Diuresis Treated with Canagliflozin. We herein report the case of a 27-year-old Asian woman with type 2 diabetes who was treated with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (canagliflozin) who developed euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis and persistent diuresis in the absence of hyperglycemia. Canagliflozin raised the risk of amputations and the rate of fractures in the CANVAS trial, although more data are necessary before drawing definite conclusions. The risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis seems to be minimal when the drugs are prescribed properly. Severe Ketoacidosis Associated with Canagliflozin (Invokana): A Safety Concern.  However, some serious side effects, including severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), have been reported.  At present, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved three medications (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) in this drug class for the management of Type 2 diabetes. In May 2015, the FDA issued a warning of ketoacidosis with use of this drug class. We present a case of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to canagliflozin in a type 2 diabetic patient.

Don't normal cells express the protein TERT?,yes,"Since telomerase has been recognized as a relevant factor distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells, it has become a very promising target for anti-cancer therapy Telomerase plays a pivotal role in cellular immortality and tumorigenesis. Its activity is normally not detectable in most somatic cells while it is reactivated in the vast majority of cancer cells. Therefore, inhibition of telomerase has been viewed as a promising anticancer approach due to its specificity for cancer cells. Telomerase activity is found in 85%-90% of all human cancers but not in their adjacent normal cells. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an essential component in the telomerase complex that plays an important role in telomerase activity. elomerase activation is considered to be a critical step in carcinogenesis and its activity correlates closely with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression. Since only tumor cells that express telomerase activity would activate this promoter, the hTERT proximal promoter allows for preferential expression of viral genes in tumor cells, leading to selective viral replication"
Is the Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease?,yes,"A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  These findings suggest that aberrant SR Ca2+ release and increased susceptibility to delayed afterdepolarizations underlie triggered arrhythmic activity in human Ala96 HRC carriers. The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers. These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers. HRC plays an important role in myocyte differentiation and in antiapoptotic cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion induced cardiac injury. Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release. Indeed, evidence from genetic models of JCN and HRC indicate that they are important in cardiophysiology as alterations in these proteins affect SR Ca(2+) handling and cardiac function. In addition, downregulation of JCN and HRC may contribute to Ca(2+) cycling perturbations manifest in the failing heart, where their protein levels are significantly reduced. The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM. AAV-mediated knock-down of HRC exacerbates transverse aorta constriction-induced heart failure. Chronic overexpression of HRC that may disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy Ablation of HRC showed relatively normal phenotypes under basal condition, but exhibited a significantly increased susceptibility to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy Our results present evidence that down-regulation of HRC could deteriorate cardiac function in TAC-FH through perturbed SR-mediated Ca(2+) cycling However, AAV9-mediated HRC-KD in TAC-FH was associated with decreased fractional shortening and increased cardiac fibrosis compared with control. Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+) binding protein, specifically expressed in striated muscles of mammals. In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein. Recently, a potential role in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis has been assigned to HRC due to its activity as regulator of SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) release. In addition, HRC null mice displayed a significantly exaggerated response to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy by isoproterenol compared to their wild-type littermates. The exaggerated response of HRC knockout mice to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy is consistent with a regulatory role for HRCBP in calcium handling in vivo and suggests that mutations in HRC, in combination with other genetic or environmental factors, might contribute to pathological hypertrophy and heart failure. We observed that the levels of HRC were reduced in animal models and human heart failure. Collectively, these data indicate that alterations in expression levels of HRC are associated with impaired cardiac SR Ca homeostasis and contractile function. Abnormal calcium cycling and cardiac arrhythmias associated with the human Ser96Ala genetic variant of histidine-rich calcium-binding protein. The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy"
Can the iPS cell technology be used in Fanconi anemia therapy?,yes,"We explain a protocol for the reproducible generation of genetically corrected iPSCs starting from the skin biopsies of Fanconi anemia patients using retroviral transduction with OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4 Before reprogramming, the fibroblasts and/or keratinocytes of the patients are genetically corrected with lentiviruses expressing FANCA. Disease-corrected haematopoietic progenitors from Fanconi anaemia induced pluripotent stem cells Here we show that, on correction of the genetic defect, somatic cells from Fanconi anaemia patients can be reprogrammed to pluripotency to generate patient-specific iPS cells. These cell lines appear indistinguishable from human embryonic stem cells and iPS cells from healthy individuals Most importantly, we show that corrected Fanconi-anaemia-specific iPS cells can give rise to haematopoietic progenitors of the myeloid and erythroid lineages that are phenotypically normal, that is, disease-free"

Doesn't thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling?,no,"The aim of this brief paper is to highlight new developments in understanding the cardioprotective role of thyroid hormone in reverting regulatory networks involved in adverse cardiac remodeling. Thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1) is shown to be critical for the maturation of cardiomyocytes and for the cellular response to stress. TRα1 is altered during post ischemic cardiac remodeling but the physiological significance of this response is not fully understood.  AMI induces downregulation of thyroid hormone signaling and pharmacological inhibition of TRα1 further depresses post-ischemic cardiac function. These findings reveal crucial roles for Dio3 in heart function and remodeling, which may have pathophysiologic implications for human restrictive cardiomyopathy. TH administration after AMI prevented tissue hypothyroidism and resulted in decreased beta-MHC expression, increased wall thickening and normalized wallstress, while stretch-induced p38 MAPK activation was increased. We conclude that diabetes exacerbates post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and that tissue hypothyroidism may be involved in this response. Thyroid hormone can favorably remodel the diabetic myocardium after acute myocardial infarction. It has been previously shown that regulators of physiological growth such as thyroid hormone (TH) can favorably remodel the post ischaemic myocardium. Acute myocardial infarction in diabetic rats results in TH receptor down-regulation with important physiological consequences. TH treatment prevents this response and improves cardiac hemodynamics. TH affects cardiac remodeling by limiting reperfusion injury, and, at later states, by inducing distinct changes in cardiac chamber geometry in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, administration of TH can convert pathologic to physiologic hypertrophy. These effects are the result of favorable cellular remodeling. Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical in cardiac cell differentiation (regulating contractile proteins and cell geometry) and this effect could be potentially exploited therapeutically in reversing the process of de-differentiation which underlies postischemic cardiac remodeling.  TH treatment partially reverses cardiac dysfunction in rats with old myocardial infarction by favorably changing cardiac chamber geometry and expression of myosin isoforms. Thyroid hormone, unlike current treatments, appears to be a paradigm of therapeutic intervention which aims at restoring cardiac geometry and may prove new effective treatment for heart failure. Changes in thyroid hormone (TH)-TH receptors (TRs) axis occur in the course of post-infarction cardiac remodeling and seem to contribute to cardiac fetal phenotype. TH can ""rebuild"" the post-infarcted heart by preventing the fetal-like pattern of contractile proteins expression, normalizing wall tension, and optimizing cardiac chamber geometry.  TH, apart from its ""classical"" actions on cardiac contractility and heart rhythm, appears to regulate various intracellular signaling pathways related to stress responses and cardiac remodelling. More importantly, experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that TH can limit ischaemic injury, attenuate cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac hemodynamics.  Thyroid hormone attenuates cardiac remodeling and improves hemodynamics early after acute myocardial infarction in rats. Thyroid hormone administration early after infarction attenuates cardiac remodeling and significantly improves myocardial performance. It has previously been shown that thyroid hormone can reverse cardiac remodeling in failing hearts by reducing myocardial wall stress due to the unique changes induced in cardiac myocyte shape."
Isn't autism one of the characteristics of Moebius syndrome?,no,"The diagnosis of Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder, is primarily based on congenital facial and abducent nerve palsy. Involvement of other cranial nerves is also common. Occasionally the V, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves are involved, resulting in a difficulty to chew, swallow, and cough, which often leads to respiratory complications. Mental retardation and autism have been reported in some cases Moebius sequence is a rare congenital disorder usually defined as a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. A strong association of Moebius sequence with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been suggested in earlier studies with heterogenous age groups Certain genetic syndromes are providing us with extremely valuable information about the role played by genetics in autism. This is the case of the following syndromes: Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, 15q11-q13 duplication, fragile X syndrome, fragile X premutation, deletion of chromosome 2q, XYY syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Apert syndrome, mutations in the ARX gene, De Lange syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome, Williams syndrome, Rett syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Down syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Steinert disease, tuberous sclerosis, Duchenne's disease, Timothy syndrome, 10p terminal deletion, Cowden syndrome, 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, Myhre syndrome, Sotos syndrome, Cohen syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Lujan-Fryns syndrome, Moebius syndrome, hypomelanosis of Ito, neurofibromatosis type 1, CHARGE syndrome and HEADD syndrome. Seventeen children and young adults with Moebius syndrome were examined with a view to finding symptoms of autism. Some 40% of the group showed all or many of the symptoms typical of autistic disorder Fifty-nine cases with infantile autism/autistic disorder were subclassified according to associated medical condition (fragile-X, tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, hypo-melanosis of Ito, Moebius syndrome, Rett syndrome, and a 'new' syndrome associated with a marker chromosome).

Aren't splicing speckles associated with transcription?,yes,"We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes. We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces. Analysis of a HeLa cell line stably expressing EYFP-NHPX showed that the nucleolar accumulation of NHPX was preceded by its transient accumulation in splicing speckles. In vivo analysis of NHPX reveals a novel nucleolar localization pathway involving a transient accumulation in splicing speckles. ""Splicing speckles"" are major nuclear domains rich in components of the splicing machinery and polyA(+) RNA. Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckle In normal cell growth conditions GFPeIF4A-III was mainly nucleoplasmic, but in hypoxia stress conditions it moved to the nucleolus and splicing speckles. Localization of eIF4A-III in the nucleolus and splicing speckles is an indicator of plant stress.  Using antibodies raised against mouse RBM6 to immunostain mammalian cell lines we found that the endogenous protein was both distributed diffusely in the nucleus and concentrated in a small number of nuclear foci that corresponded to splicing speckles/interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs Subnuclear targeting of the RNA-binding motif protein RBM6 to splicing speckles and nascent transcripts."
Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,yes,"In areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells Of 30 patients in the selenium treated group, 6 patients were overtly hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in the placebo-treated group Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease Serum selenium is low in newly diagnosed Graves' disease S-Se was lower in patients with GD than in controls (mean (SD), GD: 89·9 μg/l (18·4); controls: 98·8 μg/l (19·7), P < 0·01) Patients with newly diagnosed GD and AIH had significantly lower s-Se compared with random controls. Our observation supports the postulated link between inadequate selenium supply and overt autoimmune thyroid disease, especially GD Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction The recent recognition that the essential trace element selenium is incorporated as selenocysteine in all three deiodinases has decisively confirmed the clear-cut link between selenium and thyroid function. It has additionally been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease Maintenance of ""selenostasis"" via optimal intake not only aids preservation of general health but also contributes substantially to the prevention of thyroid disease Low birth weight, iodine excess and deficiency, selenium deficiency, parity, oral contraceptive use, reproductive span, fetal microchimerism, stress, seasonal variation, allergy, smoking, radiation damage to the thyroid gland, viral and bacterial infections all play a role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disorders It has additionally been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease. Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. [Selenium deficiency in celiac disease: risk of autoimmune thyroid diseases]. Low birth weight, iodine excess and deficiency, selenium deficiency, parity, oral contraceptive use, reproductive span, fetal microchimerism, stress, seasonal variation, allergy, smoking, radiation damage to the thyroid gland, viral and bacterial infections all play a role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disorders. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. Our observation supports the postulated link between inadequate selenium supply and overt autoimmune thyroid disease, especially GD.

Selenoproteins contain the essential trace element selenium whose deficiency leads to major disorders including cancer, male reproductive system failure, or autoimmune thyroid disease. It has additionally been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. Some investigators suggest that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease. Therefore, even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases.

Can desvenlafaxine be used at a dose of 50mg/day?,yes,"Long-term use of desvenlafaxine was safe and well tolerated, with a clinical benefit/risk profile similar to that in other populations. e objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of desvenlafaxine for continuation treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Japanese patients. This was a phase 3, multicenter, 10-month, open-label study with flexible dosing of desvenlafaxine (25, 50, 100 mg/day) n an effort to establish the lowest effective dose of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), we assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 10- and 50-mg/day desvenlafaxine vs placebo for the treatment of major depressive disorder Change from baseline to final evaluation in adjusted HAM-D(17) total scores was not significantly different comparing desvenlafaxine 10 mg/day (-9.28) and desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day (-8.92) with placebo (-8.42) Overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events with both doses were similar to placebo However, in a companion study reported separately, desvenlafaxine 50 mg, but not 25 mg, separated from placebo. Taken together, these studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.  Desvenlafaxine XR was dosed at 50 mg/day for 10 days. Desvenlafaxine therapy is initiated at the therapeutic dose (50 mg/day) without a need for dose titration. Clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of DVS in doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/day for the treatment of MDD in adult outpatients. The effects of DVS 50 mg/day have been clearly distinguished from placebo in the reduction of MDD symptoms in such clinical trials. No additional therapeutic benefits were found at doses > 50 mg/day. The recommended dose of DVS ranges from 50 to 100 mg. Adult outpatients with major depressive disorder received desvenlafaxine doses ranging from 50-400 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks  At the recommended therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day, discontinuation due to adverse events was similar to placebo atients received fixed (50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/day; n=1,342) or flexible doses (100-400 mg/day; n=463) of desvenlafaxine or placebo (n=1,108) Desvenlafaxine demonstrated short-term efficacy for treating major depressive disorder across the range of doses studied. No evidence of greater efficacy was observed with doses >50 mg/day; a strong dose-response effect on tolerability was observed. To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50- and 100-mg/day doses of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) MDD and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) scores > or =20 were randomly assigned to double-blind placebo or desvenlafaxine treatment (fixed dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Desvenlafaxine 50 mg was associated with a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline on the HAM-D(17) (-11.5) compared with placebo (-9.5, p=0.018)  These results demonstrate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day for treating MDD.  CONCLUSIONS: Desvenlafaxine at the recommended dose of 50 mg/d was effective in relapse prevention of depression during a 6-month period in patients who demonstrated stable response after 20 weeks of open-label desvenlafaxine treatment."
Is TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease?,yes,"Absence of TREM2 polymorphisms in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration  These data demonstrate that TREM2 coding region is highly conserved, implying a crucial role of this receptor. Further studies, including a functional analysis, are certainly required to clarify the role of TREM2 in neurodegenerative processes Moreover, a rare TREM2 exon 2 variant (p.R47H) was reported to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with an odds ratio as strong as that for APOEε4 We observed an enrichment of rare variants across TREM2 in both AD and FTD patients compared to controls, most notably in the extracellular IgV-set domain None of the rare variants individually reached significant association, but the frequency of p.R47H was increased ~ 3-fold in both AD and FTD patients compared to controls, in line with previous reports Our data corroborate and extend previous findings to include an increased frequency of rare heterozygous TREM2 variations in AD and FTD, and show that TREM2 variants may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases in general. non-synonymous genetic rare variant, rs75932628-T (p.R47H), in the TREM2 gene has recently been reported to be a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) These data strongly support the important role of p.R47H in AD risk, and suggest that this rare genetic variant is not related to FTD.  Higher levels of TREM2 mRNA (p = 0.002) and protein (p < 0.001) were identified in AD patients Our results indicate that TREM2 might serve as a novel noninvasive biomarker for AD diagnosis studies have identified the rs75932628 (R47H) variant in TREM2 as an Alzheimer's disease risk factor with estimated odds ratio ranging from 2.9 to 5.1 This study replicates the association between R47H and Alzheimer's disease risk in a large, population-based sample, and estimates the population frequency and attributable risk of this rare variant Moreover, mutation scanning of the five exons of TREM2 failed to detect the presence of novel polymorphisms A rare missense mutation (rs75932628-T) in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which was predicted to result in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease in Iceland We also found that carriers of rs75932628-T between the ages of 80 and 100 years without Alzheimer's disease had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers Our findings strongly implicate variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's disease through impaired containment of inflammatory processes rs75932628-T variant of the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) These results confirm the association between this variant and AD and underline its involvement in early-onset cases recent studies have reported the association of rs75932628-T in the TREM2 gene with the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) Rs75932628-T is a rare nonsynonymous variant (p.R47H) that confers a high risk of AD with an effect size similar to that of the APOE ɛ4 allele Here, we report the first positive replication study in a Spanish population and confirm that TREM2 rs75932628-T is associated with the risk for AD works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an odds ratio similar to that of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele The reduced function of TREM2 was speculated to be the main cause in the pathogenic effects of this risk variant, and TREM2 is highly expressed in white matter, as well as in the hippocampus and neocortex, which is partly consistent with the pathological features reported in AD brain, indicating the possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis Emerging evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 could suppress inflammatory response by repression of microglia-mediated cytokine production and secretion, which may prevent inflammation-induced bystander damage of neurons TREM2 also participates in the regulation of phagocytic pathways that are responsible for the removal of neuronal debris Based on the potential protective actions of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis, targeting TREM2 might provide new opportunities for AD treatment Under the hypothesis that low-prevalence variants showing moderate-to-high effect size may be associated with risk for sAD, two independent research groups have demonstrated that a rare variant (rs75932628, encoding a substitution of arginine by histidine at residue 47 (R47H), in the TREM2 gene, which encodes the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is significantly associated with an increased susceptibility to sAD Recently, a novel variant in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has been identified that has refocused the spotlight back onto inflammation as a major contributing factor in AD TREM gene cluster, a region recently reported to harbor rare variants that increase AD risk evidence suggests that rare genetic variants within the TREM2 gene are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease These data suggest that a mutational burden in TREM2 may serve as a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease in general, and that potentially this class of TREM2 variant carriers with dementia should be considered as having a molecularly distinct form of neurodegenerative disease The association of TREM2 variants with AD brings innate immune signaling into the light, affirming innate immunity's role as a significant factor in AD pathogenesis The purpose of this paper is to discuss these recent developments including the potential role that TREM2 normally plays and how loss of function may contribute to AD pathogenesis by enhancing oxidative stress and inflammation within the CNS Even though we are more at the beginning than at the end of sAD genetics, there is some reason for optimism given the recent identification of novel risk or protective variants (such as rare TREM2 and APP mutations) showing strong statistical associations with sAD"
Isn't Ctf4 involved in sister chromatid cohesion establishment?,no,"In addition to Eco1, several other factors contribute to cohesion establishment, including Ctf4, Ctf18, Tof1, Csm3, Chl1 and Mrc1, but little is known about their roles. Here, we show that each of these factors facilitates cohesin acetylation. Moreover, the absence of Ctf4 and Chl1, but not of the other factors, causes a synthetic growth defect in cells lacking Eco1. Distinct from acetylation defects, sister chromatid cohesion in ctf4Δ and chl1Δ cells is not improved by removing Wapl Thus, Ctf4 and Chl1 delineate an additional acetylation-independent pathway that might hold important clues as to the mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 Influence of the human cohesion establishment factor Ctf4/AND-1  Here, we used Xenopus egg extracts to show that AND-1 and Tim1-Tipin, homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ctf4 and Tof1-Csm3, respectively, are associated with the replisome and are required for proper establishment of the cohesion observed in the M-phase extracts These data defined two cohesion pathways, one containing CSM3, TOF1, CTF4, and CHL1, and the second containing MRC1, CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks WSS1 was also found to interact genetically with SGS1, TOP3, SRS2 and CTF4, which are involved in recombination, repair of replication forks and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion The catalytic subunit of budding yeast Polalpha (Pol1p) has been shown to associate in vitro with the Spt16p-Pob3p complex, a component of the nucleosome reorganization system required for both replication and transcription, and with a sister chromatid cohesion factor, Ctf4p Constituents of the replication fork, such as the DNA polymerase alpha-binding protein Ctf4, contribute to cohesion in ways that are poorly understood Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 and the pathway involving the acetylation of Smc3. Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Ctf4/AND-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both DNA replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. We show here that CTF8, CTF4 and a helicase encoded by CHL1 are required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells, and provide evidence that Chl1 functions during S-phase. In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Thus, Ctf4 and Chl1 delineate an additional acetylation-independent pathway that might hold important clues as to the mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment.

Hasn't intepirdine been evaluated in clinical trials? (November 2017),no,"Using small molecules blocking 5-HT6serotonin receptor (intepirdine), inhibiting BACE activity (E2609, AZD3293, and verubecestat), or reducing tau aggregation (TRx0237) are also currently in Phase III clinical trials."
Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,yes,"6-Shogaol reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and released cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol via Bax activation.  Moreover, overexpression of ERβ prevented Bax activation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage during apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that EV71 infection altered Bax conformation and triggered its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria in RD cells. Subsequently, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria to cytosol. associated with translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation.  Once activated, BAK and BAX form proteolipid pores in the OMM leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and the release of inner membrane space proteins, such as cytochrome c, which promotes caspase activation.   Our results showed that OC induced a caspase-dependent apoptosis by triggering a series of events in HeLa cells including Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, chromosome fragmentation followed by caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage and eventually cell death.  Bax plays a key role in intrinsic apoptotic signaling in neurons by allowing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c."
Do statins cause diabetes?,yes,"Statin use has been associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and with impaired glycemic control in T2DM patients The relationship between T2DM and statins is further complicated since these drugs can cause new onset diabetes (NOD) although there is an overall benefit in terms of preventing vascular events  It has been repeatedly reported that statins may cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). However, a small, but significant risk of new-onset diabetes has been reported in patients treated with statins. The National Lipid Association (NLA) Statin Diabetes Safety Task Force concluded that the cardiovascular benefit of statin therapy outweighs the risk for developing diabetes It has been repeatedly reported that statins may cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) It has been repeatedly reported that statins may cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). However, limited evidence exists from direct head to head comparisons of statins on whether the risk of DM differs among statins. Short-term statin exposure is associated with reduced all-cause mortality in persons with diabetes. Despite the fact that higher statin doses are more likely to lead to new-onset diabetes, for every case of diabetes caused, there are approximately three cardiovascular events reduced with high dose versus moderate dose statin therapy. It has been repeatedly reported that statins may cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM).  Statins are evidence-based drugs to prevent cardiovascular (CV) disease. However, their benefits have been disputed by a statin-related increased risk of new onset diabetes  Compared with pravastatin, treatment with higher potency statins, especially atorvastatin and simvastatin, might be associated with an increased risk of new onset diabetes  statins are associated with a small increase in incidence of diabetes in patients predisposed to glycemic alteration  Higher potency statin use is associated with a moderate increase in the risk of new onset diabetes compared with lower potency statins in patients treated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease An increased risk of new onset treated diabetes was found in those treated with statins showing significant duration and dose effect Although most of the clinical studies suggest a worsening of insulin resistance and secretion, the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy outweigh the risk of developing insulin resistance, thus the data suggest the need to treat dyslipidemia and to make patients aware of the possible risk of developing type 2 diabetes or, if they already are diabetic, of worsening their metabolic control Statin therapy can slightly increase risk of incident diabetes in subjects with hypercholesterolemia."
Are there any specific antidotes for rivaroxaban?,no,"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)--apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban--have a significantly smaller risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs. he new oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis) have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and are alternatives to warfarin. However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect.  Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications;  Like any new therapy, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential challenges and one of the most concerning aspects of the new target-specific oral anticoagulants is the lack of a proven method to reverse their effect. Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes. NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication. But they have disadvantages also, they depend on renal clearance, they can interact with other medicaments and they lack a specific antidote.  While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in ""real-life"" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. Rivaroxaban, which inhibits activated factor X (Xa), is currently in clinical trials and is the most advanced factor Xa inhibitor. The drug offers once-daily oral dosing, with no need for injections, dose titration, or frequent blood tests to monitor the international normalised ratio. It has a rapid onset of action and, although there is no specific antidote, it has a short plasma elimination half-life (about 5-9 hours).  Increased use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban as oral anticoagulants for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and acute deep venous thrombosis has increased despite the lack of known antidotes to these medications. There is no antidote for reversal and no reliable laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect for emergency situations.  Further concerns about the use of NOAC in the elderly are the high prevalence of renal insufficiency in AF patients >75 years of age, the largely unknown risk of drug-drug and drug-food interactions, the lack of easily available laboratory monitoring tests of anticoagulant activity and the lack of an antidote. Specific antidotes for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies against the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran or recombinant Xa-analog in the case of factor Xa inhibitors, are still being investigated in early clinical trials. In early 2013 there is no antidote for dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban, nor any specific treatment with proven efficacy for severe bleeding linked to these drugs."
Is Alpers disease inherited in an autosomal recessive mode?,yes,"Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder Alpers syndrome is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder that affects children and young adults Alpers' syndrome is a fatal neurogenetic disorder first described more than 70 years ago. It is an autosomal recessive, developmental mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder characterized by deficiency in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) catalytic activity, refractory seizures, neurodegeneration, and liver disease Histopathological findings in both patients ((a) chronic hepatitis with prominent bile duct proliferation, fatty change, and fibrosis; (b) in the brain a patchy destruction of the cerebral cortex, predominantly involving striate cortex) were characteristic of progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood with liver disease--Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome--a rare autosomal recessive disorder usually seen in infants and young children Histopathological findings in both patients ((a) chronic hepatitis with prominent bile duct proliferation, fatty change, and fibrosis; (b) in the brain a patchy destruction of the cerebral cortex, predominantly involving striate cortex) were characteristic of progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood with liver disease--Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome--a rare autosomal recessive disorder usually seen in infants and young children. Alpers syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hepatocerebral degenerative disorder. Alpers disease is a recessive mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in POLG1 and characterized primarily by progressive neurological and hepatic degeneration. Alpers syndrome is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder that affects children and young adults. We conclude that Alpers disease can be a cause of rapidly progressive liver failure in early childhood. Although the cause of this autosomal recessive disease is not known, it does not appear to be related to peroxisomal dysfunction."
Isn't NADPH oxidase 5 expressed in rodents?,yes,"Because the Nox5 gene is absent in rodents, we generated transgenic mice expressing human Nox5 in a podocyte-specific manner (Nox5(pod+)).  The NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) gene is present in humans but not rodents.  The data document that the NOX5 gene was expressed in cells of lagomorphs unlike rodents, making the rabbit an interesting model to study NOX5 functions. Nox5 was lost in rodents, and Nox3, which functions in the inner ear in gravity perception, emerged the most recently, corresponding to full-time adaptation of vertebrates to land.  NOX expression patterns in animals are complex and ancestral NOXes, NOX5-like isoforms and DUOXes are generally found. But there are exceptions; for example rodents lack NOX5 and Caenorhabditis elegans expresses only DUOXes. The NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) gene is present in humans but not rodents.

Can NEECHAM Confusion Scale be used for evaluation of postoperative delirium?,yes,"Sampling was achieved in a nonrandomized targeted manner and delirium was assessed using NeeCham questionnaire.  Delirium in older patients: a diagnostic study of NEECHAM Confusion Scale in surgical intensive care unit. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the diagnostic value and determine the feasibility of the NEECHAM Confusion Scale on critically ill older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study confirm the good diagnostic value and ease of application of the NEECHAM scale with nonventilated intensive care patients.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The NEECHAM scale can be used to detect delirium during the routine nursing assessment of nonintubated older patients as it requires minimal demand and stress on the patient as well as on the bedside nurse. The NEECHAM Confusion Scale and the validated chart review instrument were used for diagnosis of delirium.  Among the various screening instruments, NEECHAM confusion scale and delirium observation scale appear to be most suitable screening instrument for patients' in general medical and surgical wards, depending on the type of rater (physician or nurse).

Isn't edema a symptom of nephrotic syndrome?,no,"Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a common clinical disease with four main clinical manifestations: hypoalbuminemia (<30 g/L), macro-proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 h), edema, and hyperlipidemia.  Nephrotic syndrome is an unusual manifestation of IgA Nephropathy (IgAN). Twelve patients with IgAN with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome were evaluated and followed up. All patients presented with generalized edema.  The clinical features of sudden onset of generalized edema, initial heavy proteinuria and initial severe hypoalbuminemia might help identify the subset of patients, especially in low grade IgAN. Most patients presented within 3 months duration (61.4%) and the most common symptom was puffiness of face (98.45%) followed by pedal edema (91%).  We analyzed medical records of 290 patients with diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome as defined by International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC), between January 1987 and December 2000, at the Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar.  He was admitted because of systemic edema and dyspnea on effort Laboratory data revealed renal failure and nephrotic syndrome, whereas there was no symptom of diabetic retinopathy. Nephrotic syndrome: more than just oedema. Oedema is the commonest presenting symptom and sign in nephrotic syndrome.  One of these five clinical syndromes is the nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria > 3.5 g/day accompanied by hypalbuminemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and pronounced edema Tolvaptan therapy for massive edema in a patient with nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by water and sodium retention, which leads to edema The non-osmotic stimulation of arginine vasopressin release from the pituitary gland has been implicated as one of the important factors in abnormal water retention in patients with NS.We present the initial description of a patient with massive edema caused by refractory nephrotic syndrome, which was effectively treated with tolvaptan, a selective oral vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist.Tolvaptan is effective for the treatment of massive edema caused by NS We report a child with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with diuretic-resistant nephrotic edema treated successfully using acute peritoneal dialysis as a means of UF Albumin and Furosemide Combination for Management of Edema in Nephrotic Syndrome: A Review of Clinical Studies The treatment of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome is generally managed by dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics Nine months after introduction of tiopronin, the boy manifested generalized edema, oliguria, and biochemical indices of nephrotic syndrome Blessed were the days when it all made sense and the apparent mechanism for edema formation in nephrotic syndrome was straightforward: the kidneys lost protein in the urine, which lowered the plasma oncotic pressure The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by a combination of pathological lab values and clinical symptoms, i. e. pronounced proteinuria (usually more than 3 - 3,5 g protein/24 h), hypoalbuminemia, edema and hyperlipidemia. The patient was admitted with edema of both legs, and the nephrotic syndrome was discovered, leading to the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis on kidney biopsy. Linear regression to relate measures.Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome at baseline (serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL, serum total cholesterol > 260 mg/dL or use of a statin, and edema or use of a loop diuretic); progression of chronic kidney disease during follow-up (doubling of baseline serum creatinine level or requirement for dialysis or kidney transplantation). A case of interstitial shadows associated with oral cyclophosphamide therapy in a 32-month-old girl with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, who was admitted to the Nishi-Kobe Medical Center with systemic edema, is reported. Nephrotic syndrome represents a constellation of symptoms including hyperalbuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema formation, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hypercoagulopathy, and increased infection risk. Pathophysiology of edema formation in children with nephrotic syndrome not due to minimal change disease. To study the evidence-based therapy of edema in nephrotic syndrome by analyzing the literatures systematically. Edema is the prominent feature of nephrotic syndrome and initially develops around the eyes and legs. Intussusception should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in patients with nephrotic syndrome, especially in patients exhibiting prolonged edema. Oedema is the commonest presenting symptom and sign in nephrotic syndrome. Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome at baseline (serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL, serum total cholesterol > 260 mg/dL or use of a statin, and edema or use of a loop diuretic); progression of chronic kidney disease during follow-up (doubling of baseline serum creatinine level or requirement for dialysis or kidney transplantation)."
Isn't thyroid hormone therapy indicated in patients with heart failure?,yes,"Patients with chronic heart failure and subclinical hypothyroidism significantly improved their physical performance when normal TSH levels were reached. Early and sustained physiological restoration of circulating L-T3 levels after MI halves infarct scar size and prevents the progression towards heart failure. This beneficial effect is likely due to enhanced capillary formation and mitochondrial protection. These data indicate that T(3) replacement to euthyroid levels improves systolic function and tends to improve diastolic function, potentially through changes in myocardial gene expression. In these patients, the administration of synthetic triiodothyronine (T(3)) was well tolerated and induced significant improvement in cardiac function without increased heart rate and metabolic demand. In DC patients, short-term synthetic L-T(3) replacement therapy significantly improved neuroendocrine profile and ventricular performance. Triiodothyronine was well tolerated without episodes of ischemia or clinical arrhythmia. There was no significant change in heart rate or metabolic rate and there was minimal increase in core temperature. Cardiac output increased with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance in patients receiving the largest dose, consistent with a peripheral vasodilatory effect."
Aren't there any desmins present in plants?,yes,"Inherited mutations in the gene coding for the intermediate filament protein desmin have been demonstrated to cause severe skeletal and cardiac myopathies. Mutations in the intermediate filament (IF) protein desmin cause severe forms of myofibrillar myopathy characterized by partial aggregation of the extrasarcomeric desmin cytoskeleton and structural disorganization of myofibrils. The family of 70 intermediate filament genes (including those encoding keratins, desmins, and lamins) is now known to be associated with a wide range of diverse diseases, at least 72 distinct human pathologies, including skin blistering, muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, premature aging syndromes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cataract.  Mutations in desmin have been associated with a subset of human myopathies. Characterization of a zebrafish (Danio rerio) desmin cDNA: an early molecular marker of myogenesis. Acute effects of desmin mutations on cytoskeletal and cellular integrity in cardiac myocytes. Desmin is a muscle-specific protein and a constitutive subunit of the intermediate filaments (IF) in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. It is an early marker of skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have characterized a clone of desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library.  Immunohistochemical investigation showed a positive reaction for smooth muscle actin and desmins in the spindle cells proliferated in the lymph nodes; no cytokeratin positivity was detected.  We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide, electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine heart Purkinje fibers.  Mesothelial and ovarian carcinoma cells could not be distinguished by (intermediate) filament typing, using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to keratins, vimentins and desmins. A fast and convenient procedure for the purification of polymerization-competent smooth-muscle desmin is described. Desmin from chicken gizzard and hog stomach were compared by fingerprint techniques."
Have hESC been tested for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration?,yes,"Development of human embryonic stem cell therapies for age-related macular degeneration In this review, we describe recent approaches to develop cell-based therapies for the treatment of AMD. Recent research has focused on replacing the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer of cells vital to photoreceptor cell health. We discuss the various methods used to differentiate and purify RPE from human embryonic stem cells (HESC), and describe the surgical approaches being used to transplant these cells in existing and forthcoming clinical trials. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by the loss or dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is the most common cause of vision loss among the elderly. Stem-cell-based strategies, using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), may provide an abundant donor source for generating RPE cells in cell replacement therapies. This study contributes to our understanding of the utility of hESC/hiPSC-derived RPE in AMD therapy. Two important early potential hESC applications are the use of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, an untreatable form of macular dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a promising source of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells: cells that can be used for the treatment of common and incurable forms of blindness, such as age-related macular degeneration.

Isn't low T3 syndrome related with high BNP in cardiac patients?,no,"BNP and fT3 are independently associated with exercise capacity in severely compromised HF patients. fter adjustment for known confounders, NT-pro-BNP was significantly associated with fT3 and low-T3 syndrome. fT3 (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34-0.98) and low-T3 syndrome (HR 3.0, 95%CI 1.4-6.3) were predictive for mortality after adjustment for NT-pro-BNP levels and other cardiovascular prognostic variables. fT3 and low-T3 syndrome are significantly related to NT-pro-BNP in patients with cardiovascular disease, but are predictors of mortality independently of NT-pro-BNP and other known cardiovascular risk parameters. Higher NT-pro BNP concentrations were related to lower total T3 concentrations (r = -0.294, p = 0.011) and to higher reverse T3 concentrations (r = 0.353, p = 0.002)"
Isn't transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) related to gene expression levels?,no,"These mutations were frequent in plasmid-borne lacS expressed at a high level but not in single-copy lacS in the chromosome or at lower levels of expression in a plasmid. The results suggest that important DNA repair or replication fidelity functions are impaired or overwhelmed in pJlacS, with results analogous to those of the ""transcription-associated mutagenesis"" seen in bacteria and eukaryotes. the rate of point mutation in a gene increases with the expression level of the gene. Transcription induces mutagenesis on both DNA strands, indicating simultaneous actions of several TAM mechanisms. High-levels of transcription through a gene stimulate spontaneous mutation rate, a phenomenon termed transcription-associated mutation (TAM). High levels of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with increased genetic instability, which has been linked to DNA damage. Here, we describe a pGAL-CAN1 forward mutation assay for studying transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) in yeast. The acquisition of mutations was directly correlated to the level of transcription Our results demonstrate that the level of Leu(+) reversions increased significantly in parallel with the induced increase in transcription levels. Transcription-associated mutagenesis in yeast is directly proportional to the level of gene expression spontaneous mutation rate is directly proportional to the transcription level, suggesting that movement of RNA polymerase through the target initiates a mutagenic process(es) High transcription is associated with genetic instability, notably increased spontaneous mutation rates, which is a phenomenon termed Transcription-Associated-Mutagenesis (TAM). Using this system, we also investigated two hypotheses that have been proposed to explain transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM): (1) transcription impairs replication fork progression in a directional manner and (2) DNA lesions accumulate under high-transcription conditions.

Does nimotuzumab improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,yes,"The survival times were similar to those seen in historical data of standard therapy. The survival time of a matched population treated at the same hospital with irradiation alone was decreased (median 8.0 and 12.2 mo for GBM and AA patients, respectively) compared with that of the patients who received nimotuzumab and curative-intent radiotherapy. This study, in a poor prognosis population, validates the previous data of survival gain after combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy, in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma patients. The mean and median survival time for subjects treated with nimotuzumab was 31.06 and 17.76 vs. 21.07 and 12.63 months for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial, nimotuzumab showed an excellent safety profile and significant survival benefit in combination with irradiation. Nimotuzumab was well-tolerated and treatment with the antibody yielded a survival benefit: median survival time was 32.66 mo and the 2-y survival rate was 54.2%. This study demonstrated the feasibility of prolonged administration of nimotuzumab and showed preliminary evidence of clinical benefit in HGG patients with poor prognosis.  Recent clinical studies show that patients with malignant gliomas could benefit from nimotuzumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has moderate activity in patients with malignant gliomas and the toxicities are well tolerable, therefore, worth further investigation. It has been evaluated in malignant brain tumors in adults and children, and shown to be therapeutically safe and effective in terms of increased survival and improved quality of life.  Conclusions As used in this study, nimotuzumab demonstrated a broad safety profile, making it acceptable for chronic use, and implied clinical benefits in terms of increased survival and improved functional status in these patients, compared to findings described in the literature.

Isn't Mycobacterium avium less susceptible to antibiotics than Mycobacterium tuberculosis?,no,"The prevalence of MAC lung infection in two inner city hospitals was four times higher than that of TB. Most patients with combined infection were clinically consistent with MTB and responded to anti MTB treatment alone. The triplex PCR developed by us could be used to detect and differentiate M. tuberculosis, M. avium and other mycobacteria in a single reaction tube. Twelve (15%) of the 80 blood cultures were positive for mycobacteria, with Mycobacterium avium being identified in 7 (8.8%) samples and M. tuberculosis in 5 (6.2%).  The antimycobacterial activities of RS-112997, RS-124922 and RS-118641, three capuramycin analogues that inhibit phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase, were tested against clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare The MIC50/90 (mg/L) results for RS-118641 were: M. tuberculosis, 1/2; multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis, 0.5/2; M. avium, 4/8; and M. intracellulare, 0.06/0.5 These results suggest that capuramycin analogues exhibit strong antimycobacterial potential and should be considered for further evaluation in the treatment of M. tuberculosis and M. avium-M. intracellulare complex infections in humans. Mycobacterium avium causes disseminated infection in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Overall incidences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were 0.8 and 1.4 cases/100 person-years of follow-up (PYF), decreasing from 1.8 (TB) and 3.5 cases/100 PYF (MAC) before September 1995 to 0.3 and 0.2 cases/100 PYF after March 1997. Because M tuberculosis disease is preventable and curable and yet communicable, physicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion for tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults. In comparison, the goal of treating M avium complex in patients with advanced HIV disease is to reduce constitutional symptoms and improve survival. MAC pulmonary disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of SPNs, even when encountered in geographic regions with a high prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis. From April 2001 to February 2002, 80 blood samples from patients who were suspected to have disseminated mycobacterial infection, presenting fever and (preferably) a CD4 T cell count<100.0 cell/mL were investigated IL-10 underlies distinct susceptibility of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice to Mycobacterium avium infection and influences efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Clinical utility of rifabutin 1 (RBT), a potent antibiotic used in multidrug regimens for tuberculosis (TB) as well as for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), has been hampered due to dose-limiting toxicity.  Effective therapeutic regimens exist that are limited by the emergence of drug resistance and the inability of antibiotics to kill dormant organisms.

Are there canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes?,no,"Absence of canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes. The interplay of active and repressive histone modifications is assumed to have a key role in the regulation of gene expression. In contrast to this generally accepted view, we show that the transcription of genes temporally regulated during fly and worm development occurs in the absence of canonically active histone modifications. Conversely, strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability, an association that we also observe in mammals. Our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of RNA, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development. In the latter case, regulation by transcription factors would have a comparatively more important regulatory role than chromatin marks.

Is there evidence to suggest that triiodothyronine has neuroprotective properties in traumatic brain injury?,yes,"Exogenous T3 administration provides neuroprotection in a murine model of traumatic brain injury. Treatment with T3 (1.2μg/100g body weight, i.p.) 1h after TBI resulted in a significant improvement in motor and cognitive recovery after CCI, as well as in marked reduction of lesion volumes.  Western blot analysis revealed the ability of T3 to reduce brain trauma through modulation of cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Twenty-four hours after brain trauma, T3-treated mice also showed significantly lower number of TUNEL(+) apoptotic neurons and curtailed induction of Bax, compared to vehicle control. In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle.  The stimulating effect of T3 on peripheral nerve regeneration may have considerable therapeutic potential. The present study provides evidence that the peripheral nervous system has its own system responsible for the local production of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, which may play a key role during the regeneration process. Although it has been hypothesized that T3 may facilitate neuronal regeneration after CNS injury, the 5'-D2 response to brain injury is unknown. The outcome after brain injury is closely correlated with the intensity of these changes, particularly with catecholamine plasma levels and the severity of the low triiodothyronine syndrome. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine appear to enhance regeneration in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS).  T3 treatment influenced the general levels of incorporation of all treated groups over all days postoperation. T3 effects appear to involve an increased sensitivity of the cells of the injured nervous system to the hormone. T3, when administered over an 8 week period, stimulated axonal regeneration in the dorsal cortex and corpus callosum and promoted healing of the wound in the corpus callosum. The results of this investigation suggest that the use of T3 in the clinical treatment of injury to the central nervous system may be of less value than the work of earlier authors had indicated. In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle"
Isn't CHEK2 involved in cell cycle control?,no,"Moreover, cell-cycle progression genes [i.e. E2F transcription factor (E2F) family and histone deacetylase ( HDAC )] and DNA-repair genes [i.e. growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, gamma ( GADD45G ) family and serine/threonine-protein kinase Chk2 ( CHEK2)] were also increased. As CHEK2 is a cell-cycle master controller, we tested the hypothesis that heterozygosity for the frameshift alteration CHEK2*1100delC is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma. In the current study, we evaluated the possible associations of seven common variants of the DNA repair and cell cycle control genes BRCA2 and CHEK2 with malignant melanoma (MM). Promotor methylation analysis of key regulatory genes involved in cell cycle control (p14, p15, p16, CHK2), DNA repair (hMLH1), apoptosis (p73, survivin, DAPK), and differentiation (RARb, WT1) was performed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. CHEK2 is a key cell cycle control gene encoding a pluripotent kinase that can cause arrest or apoptosis in response to unrepaired DNA damage. High-fidelity maintenance of genomic integrity in eukaryotes is ensured by cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. The checkpoint kinase, Chk2, has been implicated in both of these responses. In response to DNA damage, Chk2 is initially phosphorylated at Thr-68, which leads to its full activation. The fully activated Chk2 then phosphorylates downstream substrates of cell cycle control. Checkpoint kinase 2 (hCHK2/hCds1) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell-cycle control."
Aren't loop domains preserved upon cohesin loss?,yes,"Cohesin Loss Eliminates All Loop Domains. The human genome folds to create thousands of intervals, called ""contact domains,"" that exhibit enhanced contact frequency within themselves. ""Loop domains"" form because of tethering between two loci-almost always bound by CTCF and cohesin-lying on the same chromosome. ""Compartment domains"" form when genomic intervals with similar histone marks co-segregate. Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. cohesin loss eliminates all loop domains"
Isn't the circadian clock involved in ribosome biogenesis?,no,"The circadian clock coordinates ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that the circadian clock exerts its function also through the regulation of mRNA translation.

Is the gene DUX4 epigenetically regulated in somatic cells?,yes,"There are several genes on chromosome 4q35 region including DUX4 within D4Z4 repeats. Transcription of these genes is usually repressed by epigenetic modifications of this chromosomal region and also accumulation of transcriptional repressors to the repeat array. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues.  The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor encoded in each repeat.  These mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells. In contrast to control skeletal muscle and most other somatic tissues, full-length DUX4 transcript and protein is expressed at relatively abundant levels in human testis, most likely in the germ-line cells. Induced pluripotent (iPS) cells also express full-length DUX4 and differentiation of control iPS cells to embryoid bodies suppresses expression of full-length DUX4, whereas expression of full-length DUX4 persists in differentiated FSHD iPS cells. Together, these findings indicate that full-length DUX4 is normally expressed at specific developmental stages and is suppressed in most somatic tissues. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells.

Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. Normally expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues, DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle induces expression of many germline, stem cell, and other genes that might account for the pathophysiology of FSHD. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues Normally expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues, DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle induces expression of many germline, stem cell, and other genes that might account for the pathophysiology of FSHD DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues The identification of the gene(s) and the exact epigenetic pathway underlining this disease will be mandatory to increase the rate of diagnosis for FSHD2 patients and to confirm the hypothesis of a common FSHD1 and FSHD2 pathophysiological pathway involving DUX4 gene This deletion induces epigenetic modifications that affect the expression of several genes located in the vicinity. In each D4Z4 element, we identified the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene. DUX4 expresses a transcription factor that plays a major role in the development of FSHD through the initiation of a large gene dysregulation cascade that causes myogenic differentiation defects, atrophy and reduced response to oxidative stress.  decreased epigenetic repression and variegated expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is characterized by chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on chromosome 4 and expression of the D4Z4-encoded DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. derepression of the DUX4 retrogene The aim of our study was to identify relationships between epigenetic parameters correlating with a relaxed chromatin state of the DUX4 promoter region and clinical severity as measured by a clinical severity score or muscle pathologic changes in D4Z4 contraction-dependent (FSHD1) and -independent (FSHD2) facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy patients.  Specifically, abundance of RNA transcripts encoded by the DUX4 locus correlated to differential DNA methylation and H3K36me3 enrichment. Together, these findings indicate that full-length DUX4 is normally expressed at specific developmental stages and is suppressed in most somatic tissue"
Does the Abelson-related gene (ARG) gene encode for a serine kinase?,no,"One isoform of Arg/Abl2 tyrosine kinase is nuclear and the other seven cytosolic isoforms differently modulate cell morphology, motility and the cytoskeleton. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton.  The human Arg (Abl2) nonreceptor tyrosine kinase has a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements by its C-terminal F-actin- and microtubule-binding sequences.  The tyrosine kinase abl-related gene ARG is fused to ETV6 in an AML-M4Eo patient with a t(1;12)(q25;p13): molecular cloning of both reciprocal transcripts.  The ARG gene encodes for a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase characterized by high homology with c-Abl in the TK, SH2, and SH3 domains. This is the first report on ARG involvement in a human malignancy. Ultraviolet-A and -B differentially modify the tyrosine-kinase profile of human keratinocytes and induce the expression of Arg+. Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. To investigate the expression profile of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in response to UVA and UVB we employed a reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach using degenerate primers derived from the conserved catalytic domain of PTKs.  By 3'rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (3'RACE-PCR), a novel fusion transcript was identified between the ETV6 and the Abelson-related gene (ARG) at 1q25, resulting in a chimeric protein consisting of the HLH oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the SH2, SH3, and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domains of ARG. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton. Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. We studied the relationship of direct karyotypes, determined at diagnosis and remission, to Abelson-related tyrosine kinase activity and the cytogenetic features of erythroid and myeloid colonies derived from remission marrow of six children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ABL2/ARG (ABL-related gene) belongs to the ABL (Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase) family of tyrosine kinases The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton The ARG gene encodes for a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase characterized by high homology with c-Abl in the TK, SH2, and SH3 domains. ABL2/ARG (ABL-related gene) belongs to the ABL (Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase) family of tyrosine kinases. We report that the Abelson (Abl) and Abl-related gene (Arg) nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are required for maintenance of cortical dendrites in the mouse brain. The products of the human ARG gene and the human ABL gene characterize the Abelson family of non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases. The products of the human Arg gene and human, mouse, Drosophila, and nematode Abl genes characterize the Abelson family of nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinase. By 3'rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (3'RACE-PCR), a novel fusion transcript was identified between the ETV6 and the Abelson-related gene (ARG) at 1q25, resulting in a chimeric protein consisting of the HLH oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the SH2, SH3, and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domains of ARG.

Doesn't prudent diet reduce cardiovascular risk?,no,"Using this approach, large prospective studies have reported reductions in CVD risk ranging from 10 to 60% in groups whose diets can be variously classified as ‘Healthy’, ‘Prudent’, Mediterranean’ or ‘DASH compliant’. Our findings suggest that a heart healthy dietary pattern is associated with moderately reduced risk of MI, but not related to risk of VTE. The systematically reviewed studies reveal that a high adherence to a Mediterranean type of diet or ""prudent diet"" is associated with reduced risk of CVD and some types of cancer, even in the elderly. In a large healthy Italian population, non-predefined dietary patterns including foods considered to be rather unhealthy, were associated with higher levels of cardiovascular risk factors, CRP and individual global CVD risk, whereas a ""prudent-healthy"" pattern was associated with lower levels. We observed an inverse association between the prudent pattern and AMI, with higher levels being protective. After multivariable adjustment, the prudent diet was associated with a 28% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 40) and a 17% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 10 to 24) when the highest quintile was compared with the lowest quintile.  Greater adherence to the prudent pattern may reduce the risk of cardiovascular and total mortality, whereas greater adherence to the Western pattern may increase the risk among initially healthy women. Composite diets (such as DASH diets, Mediterranean diet, 'prudent' diet) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of hypertension and CHD."
Can't administration of the thyrotropin releasing hormone reduce fatigue in cancer patients?,no,"TRH administration was associated with significant improvement (p < 0.05) in fatigue levels as measured by the Visual Analog Scale-Energy (VAS-E), was associated with significant (p < 0.05) improvement in sleep disturbances and improved quality of life.  This decrease in CRP level with TRH administration was associated with improvement in energy levels as measured by the VAS-E.  In the present pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of TRH as a treatment for CF. TRH administration was associated with significant improvement in fatigue level as measured by the VAS-E, the fatigue and vigor subscales of the POMS, and the fatigue subscale of FACIT-F (p < 0.05).  TRH administration was efficacious, safe, and tolerable in the treatment of CF with a positive impact on quality of life. These results provide a crucial impetus for pursuing TRH therapeutics to treat CF. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone can relieve cancer-related fatigue: hypothesis and preliminary observations. Global assessment using both subjective and objective parameters showed that TRH exerted clear anti-fatigue effects in four of the six TRH treatments.  These initial findings support the proposal that TRH can ameliorate cancer-related fatigue."
Has depression been shown to be a predictor of frailty?,yes,"significant role of frailty as a predictor of depression in a relatively younger old Chinese population significant relationships between frailty and depressive symptoms and mortality at 1 year These findings suggest that malnutrition is a major predictor of frailty or the ""failure to thrive"" syndrome in older persons. Depression is a major cause of poor nutritional status in older persons. Depressed mood was associated with increased risk of steep strength decline, in particular in older men with low body weight. Low body weight in combination with depressed mood may be an indicator of frailty or severe disease status that leads to accelerated strength loss and disability. Longitudinally, depressed mood was the only independent predictor of decline in cognition, functional ability, physician-rated health, and mortality;"
Doesn't Serca2a bind PLN in the heart?,no,"The human phospholamban Arg14-deletion mutant localizes to plasma membrane and interacts with the Na/K-ATPase. Moreover, PLN-R14Del did not co-immunoprecipitate with SERCA2a (as did WT-PLN), n this review, we attempted to highlight the functional significance of PLN in vertebrate cardiac physiology. We will refer to the huge literature on mammals in order to describe the molecular characteristics of this protein, its interaction with SERCA2a There is clear evidence for direct regulatory protein-protein interactions between phospholamban (PLN) and the Ca2+-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) in cytoplasmic domains These results suggest that PLN modulates the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a through intramembrane interactions, which are disrupted at long range and in concert with disruption of the well characterized cytoplasmic interactions. Phospholamban (PLN), a homopentameric, integral membrane protein, reversibly inhibits cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) activity through intramembrane interactions. The concentration of this inhibited complex is determined by the dissociation constant for the PLN pentamer (which is mutation-sensitive) and by the dissociation constant for the PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer (which is likely to be mutation-sensitive). These results support the proposal that PLN inhibition of SERCA2a involves, first, depolymerization of PLN and, second, the formation of inhibitory interactions between monomeric PLN and SERCA2a. SLN and PLN appear to bind to the same regulatory site in SERCA. However, in a ternary complex, PLN occupies the regulatory site and SLN binds to the exposed side of PLN and to SERCA. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. . Conversely, using anti-SERCA2a antibody, both PLN and acylphosphatase were co-immunoprecipitated with SERCA2a, and the PLN amount in the precipitate decreased with increasing acylphosphatase concentrations. Reconstitution of the cytoplasmic interaction between phospholamban and Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban (PLN) reversibly inhibits the Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) through a direct protein-protein interaction, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) in heart muscle cells. Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart. Its regulatory effects are mediated through its interaction with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, (SERCA2a), resulting in alterations of its Ca(2+)-affinity In a co-immunoprecipitation of PLN with SERCA2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes."
Are stress granules membraneous?,no,"PMLOs are different in size, shape, and composition, and almost invariantly contain intrinsically disordered proteins (e.g., eIF4B and TDP43 in stress granules, Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RNA-binding proteins plays an important role in the formation of multiple membrane-less organelles involved in RNA metabolism, including stress granules. Stress granules (SG) are membrane-less compartments involved in regulating mRNAs during stress.  In addition to membrane delimited organelles, proteins and RNAs can organize themselves into specific domains. Some examples include stress granules and subnuclear bodies."
Is low T3 syndrome related with high BNP in cardiac patients?,yes,"BNP and fT3 are independently associated with exercise capacity in severely compromised HF patients. fter adjustment for known confounders, NT-pro-BNP was significantly associated with fT3 and low-T3 syndrome. fT3 (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34-0.98) and low-T3 syndrome (HR 3.0, 95%CI 1.4-6.3) were predictive for mortality after adjustment for NT-pro-BNP levels and other cardiovascular prognostic variables. fT3 and low-T3 syndrome are significantly related to NT-pro-BNP in patients with cardiovascular disease, but are predictors of mortality independently of NT-pro-BNP and other known cardiovascular risk parameters. Higher NT-pro BNP concentrations were related to lower total T3 concentrations (r = -0.294, p = 0.011) and to higher reverse T3 concentrations (r = 0.353, p = 0.002)"
Aren't there ways of joint Bayesian inference of risk variants?,no,"Joint Bayesian inference of risk variants and tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments across multiple complex human diseases. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful approach for uncovering disease-associated variants in human, but fine-mapping the causal variants remains a challenge. This is partly remedied by prioritization of disease-associated variants that overlap GWAS-enriched epigenomic annotations. Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants from summary statistics across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations. In simulation, RiVIERA promising power in detecting causal variants and causal annotations, the multi-trait joint inference further improved the detection power. We applied RiVIERA to model the existing GWAS summary statistics of 9 autoimmune diseases and Schizophrenia by jointly harnessing the potential causal enrichments among 848 tissue-specific epigenomics annotations from ENCODE/Roadmap consortium covering 127 cell/tissue types and 8 major epigenomic marks. RiVIERA identified meaningful tissue-specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for Blood T-Cell specifically in the nine autoimmune diseases and Brain-specific enhancer activities exclusively in Schizophrenia. Moreover, the variants from the 95% credible sets exhibited high conservation and enrichments for GTEx whole-blood eQTLs located within transcription-factor-binding-sites and DNA-hypersensitive-sites. Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants from summary statistics across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations.

Aren't immune cells affected in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,no,"Therapeutic immunization of mSOD1 mice with a myelin-derived peptide led to CP activation, and was followed by the accumulation of immunoregulatory cells, including IL-10-producing monocyte-derived macrophages and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, and elevation of the neurotrophic factors IGF-1 and GDNF in the diseased spinal cord parenchyma Immunization with a Myelin-Derived Antigen Activates the Brain's Choroid Plexus for Recruitment of Immunoregulatory Cells to the CNS and Attenuates Disease Progression in a Mouse Model of ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective death of motor neurons (MN) in the spinal cord, and is associated with local neuroinflammation. T-cell deficiency increases neuronal loss, while boosting T cell levels reduces it. As disease accelerates, a shift occurs from beneficial immune responses (involving M2 microglia and regulatory T-cells) to deleterious immune responses (involving M1 microglia and Th1 cells). In this review, we underscore the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS and discuss the alterations and distinct phenotypes of immune cells at the different stages of disease.  Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells. The immune system has been found to be involved with positive and negative effects in the nervous system of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. In general, T cells, B cells, NK cells, mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, antibodies, complement and cytokines participate in limiting damage. Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells. We propose the following mechanism for the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) administered intrathecally in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): MSCs increase infiltration of peripheral immune cells into CNS and skew the infiltrated immune cells toward regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg ) and Th2 lymphocytes. Immune cell infiltration to the brain&apos;s territory was considered for decades to reflect a pathological process in which immune cells attack the central nervous system (CNS); such a process is observed in the inflammatory autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis (MS)."

Nodal, and an inhibitor, Lefty. as well as the expression of Lefty, an inhibitor of nodal signaling, he Nodal inhibitor lefty The morphogen Nodal was proposed to form a long-range signaling gradient via a reaction-diffusion system, on the basis of differential diffusion rates of Nodal and its antagonist Lefty."
Aren't there any specific antidotes for dabigatran?,yes,"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)--apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban--have a significantly smaller risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs.  However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect. Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications; Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  The lack of guidelines, protocols, and an established specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran potentially increases the rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with closed head injury (CHI). The novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran etexilat (Pradaxa®), rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) and apixaban (Eliquis®), also known as ""direct"" anticoagulants, act independently from antithrombin by inhibiting thrombin, as in the case of dabigatran, or by inhibiting factor Xa, as in the case of rivaroxaban and apixaban. It is assumed that they are suitable for long-term use and do not require laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, clinical experience is very limited and caution rather than quick conclusions is necessary. Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes.  NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication.  It is critical to identify and subsequently manage dabigatran etexilate toxicity because there is no specific antidote to reverse the drug's anticoagulant effects. In the absence of a specific antidote for this novel oral anticoagulant medication, even in an emergency situation, successful surgical treatment was possible with an aggressive use of available prohaemostatic agents. While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in ""real-life"" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  As there is no specific antidote, the only treatment option is discontinuation of the drug and supportive management. Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. Although there is no specific antidote to antagonise the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, due to its short duration of effect drug discontinuation is usually sufficient to reverse any excessive anticoagulant activity."
Does triiodothyronine play a regulatory role in insulin secretion from pancreas?,yes,"Our findings establish that p43 is an important regulator of glucose homeostasis and pancreatic β-cell function and provide evidence for the first time of a physiological role for a mitochondrial endocrine receptor. The p43(-/-) mice had a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of rat pancreatic islets with T3 results in augmented β-cell vitality with an increase of their functional properties. Nonetheless, the insulin secretion is sensibly augmented after T3 stimulation. Plasma glucose concentration of the fetal hypothyroid group during intravenous glucose tolerance test was significantly higher (p=0.003) at 5-20 min as compared to the control group, whereas plasma insulin concentration was significantly lower (p=0.012) at 5-20 min Although adult offspring born from hypothyroid mothers were euthyroid, their glucose tolerance and glucose stimulated insulin secretion of islets were altered hyroid hormones modulate the immune system and metabolism, influence insulin secretion Only T(3) concentrations higher than 250 microM were able to decrease cell viability and proliferation rate, to increase the rate of apoptosis and to reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion. Islets preincubated with glucose (3.3 mmol/l) and glucagon (1.4 mumol/l) plus theophylline (10 mmol/l), ACTH (0.11 nmol/l), bovine GH (0.46 mumol/l), prolactin (0.2 mumol/l) or tri-iodothyronine (1.0 nmol/l) have significantly lower Ca(2+)-ATPase activity than those preincubated with only 3.3 mmol glucose/l. All these hormones increased the release of insulin significantly. T3 (0.2 nM) did not affect insulin secretion in the absence or presence of glucose or in the presence of secretagogues (potassium and glyceraldehyde). In the perfused rat pancreas, the addition of thyroxine (10 micrograms/dL) or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (150 ng/dL) to the perfusing medium did not affect insulin secretion. The administration of thyroxine (40 micrograms/kg, s.c.) in vivo increased the plasma insulin level from 11 +/- 2 microUnits/mL (mean +/- SD) to 30 +/- 7 microUnits/mL Addition of T3 to the incubation medium, significantly modified the insulin release, but its effect varied according to the glucose concentration in the medium, i.e. it enhanced the insulin release at a glucose concentration between 2 to 8 mmol/l; it has no effect at 12 mmol/glucose, and significantly inhibited the secretion of insulin in the presence of 16.6 mmol/l glucose. Both T3 and T4 inhibited insulin secretion"
Is there any role for Pds5b in cohesion establishment?,yes,"Pds5B is required for cohesion establishment and Aurora B accumulation at centromeres. Here, we demonstrate that Pds5 proteins are essential for cohesion establishment by allowing Smc3 acetylation by the cohesin acetyl transferases (CoATs) Esco1/2 and binding of Sororin. While both proteins contribute to telomere and arm cohesion, Pds5B is specifically required for centromeric cohesion. Furthermore, reduced accumulation of Aurora B at the inner centromere region in cells lacking Pds5B impairs its error correction function, promoting chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. Our work supports a model in which the composition and function of cohesin complexes differs between different chromosomal regions. Pds5B is required for cohesion establishment and Aurora B accumulation at centromeres. Here, we demonstrate that Pds5 proteins are essential for cohesion establishment by allowing Smc3 acetylation by the cohesin acetyl transferases (CoATs) Esco1/2 and binding of Sororin."
Isn't there an association between Histone H3.3 mutations and glioma?,no,"PURPOSE: Histone H3.3 (H3F3A) mutation in the codon for lysine 27 (K27M) has been found as driver mutations in pediatric glioblastoma and has been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of thalamic gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. We report a case of thalamic glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation, which was detected in both the primary tumor diagnosed as diffuse astrocytoma obtained during the first surgery and also in the tumor diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytoma obtained at the second surgery. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates minute neuroradiological and pathological features of malignant transformation from thalamic low grade glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. The pathological diagnosis was anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and we identified a mutation in histone H3.3 in the tumor specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse. We highlight the genetic aberrations recently discovered in isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked, death-domain-associated protein, histone H3.3, and telomerase reverse transcriptase and discuss how these mutations lead to unexpected changes in the epigenetic landscape in gliomas. Particularly striking is the discovery of frequent histone H3.3 mutations in pediatric glioma, a particularly aggressive neoplasm that has long remained poorly understood Exon sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression A lesson learned from the H3.3K27M mutation found in pediatric glioma: a new approach to the study of the function of histone modifications in vivo Pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is rare, and there is a single study, a seminal discovery showing association of histone H3.3 and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 mutation with a DNA methylation signature. Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3. Mutations in H3F3A, which encodes histone H3.3, commonly occur in pediatric glioblastoma. Somatic mutations of the H3F3A and HIST1H3B genes encoding the histone H3 variants, H3.3 and H3.1, were recently identified in high-grade gliomas arising in the thalamus, pons and spinal cord of children and young adults. K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Recurrent mutations affecting the histone H3.3 residues Lys27 or indirectly Lys36 are frequent drivers of pediatric high-grade gliomas (over 30% of HGGs). Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation. Recent studies on high-grade pediatric GBM have identified two recurrent mutations (K27M and G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3 (H3F3A for H3.3 and HIST1H3B for H3.1).

Isn't there a phylogenetic analysis for HIV?,no,"The results of Burst and phylogenetic analysis suggested that the C. neoformans var. grubii strains could be separated into three nonredundant evolutionary groups (Burst group 1 to group 3).  Phylogenetic trees were constructed to evaluate the relationships between the variants We analyzed pol (protease/reverse transcriptase) sequences from 135 newly diagnosed HIV-1-infected patients during the years 2009-2011. For phylogenetic relationships, sequences were aligned to the most recent reference data set from the Los Alamos database using BioEdit (version 7.1.3). The resulting alignment was analyzed with the Phylip package (version 3.67) building a neighbor-joining tree based on the Kimura two-parameter substitution model . Phylogenetic analysis of gag gene were then performed using the MEGA 3.1 software, the gene distances were calculated by Distance program. There were three different HIV-1 subtypes including B, CRF01-AE and CRF07-BC present among twenty four MSMs in Zhengzhou Phylogenetic analysis showed interpatient and intrapatient clustering of LTR nucleotide sequences.  We evaluated the risk factors for intrafamilial transmission of HIV-1 infection through qualitative epidemiology following pol and env gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the Siberian 10.RU.6637 isolate displays the highest sequence identity to the HIV-1 subtype AG forms circulating in Uzbekistan Phylogenetic analysis showed that the evolutionary relationship of Env between HIV and SIV was the closest and they appeared to descend from a common ancestor, and the relationship of HIV and EIAV was the furthest DI was confirmed when maximum sequence divergence was excessive and supported by phylogenetic analysis  (HIV-1) dual infection (DI) has been associated with decreased CD4 T-cell counts and increased viral loads; however, the frequency of intrasubtype DI is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of HIV-1 subtype C strains from Bangladesh and related strains from other countries, and thereby clarify when and from where subtype C was introduced in the country and how it subsequently spread within Bangladesh  This study characterized HCV genotype 5 sequences from South Africa, including six near full-length genomes, as well as the E1 region from an additional 12 genotype 5 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of these near full-length genome sequences revealed that all genotype 5 sequences formed a close cluster with high bootstrap support  The evolutionary history of the B subregion was not as clear as the C subregion, as the short length of this region yielded poor phylogenetic results  Finally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to elucidate the observed pattern of HIV TDR"
Can NADPH oxidase be inhibited by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium?,yes,"Ang II treatment also led to a significant increment in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, which could be fully abolished by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium, indicating that Ang II enhanced oxidative stress via a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. NOX inhibitors (diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or apocynin) were able to achieve similar results to that of ML-7 except no effect on MLCK activity and MLC20 phosphorylation.  Significant reductions of AII effects on podocyte TRPC6 were also observed after pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium (DPI).  Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation.  Remarkably, Ang-II induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism, as shown by inhibition of ROS production via the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin.  Moreover, NADPH oxidase activation by beta CD (145.5+/-9.0%; control: 98.6+/-1.6%) was also abrogated by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin (100.4+/-3.2%) and diphenylene iodonium (9.5+/-3.3%). We used structurally diverse NADPH oxidase inhibitors, aminoethyl-benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF, 100-1000microM), apocynin (100-1000microM), and diphenylene iodonium (DPI, 3-30microM), to inhibit intrinsic NADPH oxidase activity in N27 cells. Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium. The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin. The effects of diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, on key parameters of PSC activation were evaluated in vitro. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAâ. Diphenylene iodonium is an inhibitor of the respiratory burst-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes. NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAâ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. In addition, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium or apocynin) also prevented microglia proliferation, suggesting that this may be the source of hydrogen peroxide. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium, apocynin, D-(+)-neopterine) also significantly blunted the generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of K(+), Cl(-)-cotransport and apoptosis induced by N-ethylmaleimide. With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium. NADPH-dependent superoxide production by the solubilized oxidase of neutrophils was inhibited 36% by diphenylene iodonium at a 1:1 stoichiometry with the enzyme flavoprotein content. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65 Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38 Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186) The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin ANG II further increased superoxide production in LP only, and this was inhibited by coincubation with diphenylene iodonium or apocynin (inhibitor of NADPH oxidase complex) Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection with siRNAs of MyD88, PKCalpha, Src, p47(phox), p300, and HDAC4. Here we show that cAMP-dependent decidualization can be attenuated or enhanced upon treatment of primary cultures with a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor (diphenylen iodonium) or activator (apocynin), respectively.  With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium.  The inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, and of the mitochondrial electron transport system at complex II by thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), significantly inhibited both AGE-induced ROS production and VCAM-1 expression, whereas these effects were potentiated by rotenone and antimycin A, specific inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and III, respectively.  Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol.  Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects.  The G6PD inhibitor DHEA and the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) prevented both superoxide generation and capacitation in human spermatozoa, but whereas DPI and DHEA inhibited PPP, apocynin did not influence it, suggesting that PPP activation during capacitation is not a response to increased oxidative stress but exerts a role by supplying reducing equivalents to oxygen. Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium.  Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ. Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects. UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors. Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186). Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection w Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65. The use of diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, to investigate the antimicrobial action of human monocyte derived macrophages. NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAβ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation. We compared the pharmacological profiles of the commonly used NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin and 4-(2-amino-ethyl)-benzolsulphonyl-fluoride (AEBSF), as well as the novel triazolo pyrimidine VAS3947. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha rapidly stimulated the rate of hydrogen peroxide produced by isolated microglia, and this was inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, implying that the cytokines were acting directly on microglia to stimulate the NADPH oxidase. The fractions achieved the same effects that known NADPH oxidase inhibitors, such as diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, but they presented better hydrosolubility. Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium."
Does armodafinil improve fatigue of glioma patients?,no,"CONCLUSIONS: While treatment was well-tolerated, an 8-week course of armodafinil did not improve fatigue or QOL in glioma patients undergoing RT in this pilot study.  We evaluated whether armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting medication, improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing RT. Armodafinil did not significantly improve fatigue or QOL based on the 42-day change in FACIT-F fatigue subscale, FACT-G, CFS, or BFI. Further analysis suggests no difference between the arms even after accounting for the potential bias of missing data.  Treatment was well tolerated with few grade 3 or 4 toxicities.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: While treatment was well-tolerated, an 8-week course of armodafinil did not improve fatigue or QOL in glioma patients undergoing RT in this pilot study.

Was modafinil tested for schizophrenia treatment?,yes,"Modafinil improves antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism but not excessive daytime sleepiness, psychiatric symptoms or cognition in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that modafinil was a safe adjunctive treatment which improved parkinsonian symptoms and signs in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  A review of its effects in schizophrenia suggests that modafinil facilitates cognitive functions, with pro-mnemonic effects and problem solving improvements. Emotional processing also appears to be enhanced by the drug, although to date there are only a limited number of studies. BACKGROUND: Modafinil, a putative cognitive enhancing drug, has previously been shown to improve performance of healthy volunteers as well as patients with attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia, mainly in tests of executive functions.  A review of modafinil and armodafinil as add-on therapy in antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia. It has been suggested that modafinil and its isomer armodafinil as an add-on strategy to antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia may improve cognitive functioning, attenuate fatigue, inactiveness and other negative functions as well as weight gain. Evidence for the use of modafinil or armodafinil as add-on therapy to antipsychotic drugs to alleviate fatigue, sleepiness and inactivity is inconclusive. One cohort study and one out of two single-dose crossover RCTs in which modafinil addition was studied could demonstrate a positive effect. All five RCTs of modafinil (three RCTs) and armodafinil (two RCTs) addition with a longer study duration could not demonstrate a positive effect.  In RCTs with a treatment duration of 4 weeks or more, however, no positive effect could be demonstrated on cognitive functioning with modafinil and armodafinil addition. Yet, four single-dose crossover RCTs of modafinil addition show significant positive effects on executive functioning, verbal memory span, visual memory, working memory, spatial planning, slowing in latency, impulse control and recognition of faces expressing sadness and sadness misattribution in the context of disgust recognition. The addition of modafinil or armodafinil to an antipsychotic regime, despite theoretical and preclinical considerations, has not been proved to enhance cognitive function, attenuate fatigue, enhance activity, improve negative symptoms and reduce weight in patients with schizophrenia. RATIONAL: In recent years, evidence suggests that modafinil may be useful for certain symptom domains of schizophrenia, especially for the negative and cognitive symptoms.  CONCLUSION: The present study indicates modafinil as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment of schizophrenia particularly the negative symptoms.  Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve attention, memory and executive function in the healthy population and in patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to counteract increased weight and metabolic diseases in patients taking clozapine. Modafinil (2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)acetamide) is described as an atypical stimulant and is a putative cognition enhancer for schizophrenia, but the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear. Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve emotion discrimination in healthy individuals and attention and executive function in schizophrenia.  CONCLUSIONS: These data support clinical evidence that modafinil may alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and also demonstrate the benefit of applying PLSR modeling to characterize functional brain networks in translational models relevant to central nervous system dysfunction. Modafinil improves working memory in healthy subjects and individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, though the effects of modafinil have not been evaluated on working memory in methamphetamine-dependent subjects. Modafinil is a psychostimulant approved for treating excessive sleepiness in adults; off-label uses (e.g., treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, ADHD and age-related dementias) are currently being explored.  CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to treat negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, or wakefulness/fatigue in patients on clozapine. We have previously shown that the amount of movement exhibited by patients with schizophrenia is positively correlated with the volume of left anterior cingulate cortex and that this quantity of movement can be increased by modafinil.  OBJECTIVE: Given recent reports about the off-label use of modafinil as an adjuvant for the treatment of antipsychotic-associated sedation in schizophrenia patients and the recent interest in its putative cognitive-enhancing effects in this population, we present a systematic review of available data on trials of modafinil as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive deficits, negative symptoms, and antipsychotic-induced fatigue, and its tolerability.  RESULTS: One of 4 reviewed studies found a significant effect of modafinil as an alerting agent for antipsychotic-induced fatigue and sedation. Neither of 2 reviewed studies found modafinil to improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Three of 6 reviewed studies showed that modafinil may improve short-term memory, attention, and the ability to shift mental sets.  CONCLUSIONS: While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia.  Hence, before prescribing modafinil to a schizophrenia patient, the possible risks and benefits of each particular case should be evaluated. Modafinil had a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness and depression in patients with traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-polio fatigue and multiple sclerosis; however, it did not provide any benefit greater than placebo. RATIONALE: The wake-promoting agent modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance in healthy volunteers, in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in schizophrenia.  Recently, however, modafinil has been shown to improve attentional set-shifting performance in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, modafinil shows initial promise for a variety of off-label indications in psychiatry, including treatment-resistant depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. There is increasing interest in the use of modafinil to improve cognition in schizophrenia as well as in other disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Initial findings indicate that modafinil may lead to better executive functioning and attentional performance in patients with schizophrenia.  CONCLUSIONS: Although no effect on negative symptoms was found, adjunctive therapy with modafinil may result in global improvements in patients with schizophrenia who have prominent negative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil did not improve cognitive control in all schizophrenia patients. . These data suggest that modafinil increases quantifiable motor behaviour in schizophrenia and may have an impact on avolition. One patient was on treatment with both modafinil and trazodone and reported no change after tapering each in separate discontinuation trials, while another 3 patients were taking sleeping medications and also noted no change after discontinuation.  Neuroprotective agents as add-on therapies (e.g., modafinil, erythropoietin, glycine, D-serine, memantine and celecoxib) are currently being evaluated in schizophrenia and related disorders.  In the modafinil (N = 10) and placebo (N = 10) groups, fatigue improved significantly over time (p < .01), but there were no differences between groups on changes in fatigue, positive and negative symptoms, or cognition.  CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil modulates anterior cingulate cortex function in chronic schizophrenia but its beneficial cognitive effects may be restricted to a subset of patients requiring further characterisation. Modafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition, with 64% and 82% of patients rated as clinically improved at week 4 by a blinded clinician and the investigator respectively. Modafinil significantly improved fatigue (P = 0.025, week 3) and tended to improve cognitive functioning scores.  Although preliminary, these results suggest modafinil may be an effective and well-tolerated adjunct treatment that improves global functioning and clinical condition, and reduces fatigue in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Modafinil had some cognitive enhancing properties in schizophrenia similar to those observed in healthy adults and adult patients with ADHD.  Modafinil may have potential as an important therapy for cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, particularly because of its beneficial effects on attentional set shifting. While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Isn't selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,no,"In areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells Of 30 patients in the selenium treated group, 6 patients were overtly hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in the placebo-treated group Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease Serum selenium is low in newly diagnosed Graves' disease S-Se was lower in patients with GD than in controls (mean (SD), GD: 89·9 μg/l (18·4); controls: 98·8 μg/l (19·7), P < 0·01) Patients with newly diagnosed GD and AIH had significantly lower s-Se compared with random controls. Our observation supports the postulated link between inadequate selenium supply and overt autoimmune thyroid disease, especially GD Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction The recent recognition that the essential trace element selenium is incorporated as selenocysteine in all three deiodinases has decisively confirmed the clear-cut link between selenium and thyroid function. It has additionally been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease Maintenance of ""selenostasis"" via optimal intake not only aids preservation of general health but also contributes substantially to the prevention of thyroid disease Low birth weight, iodine excess and deficiency, selenium deficiency, parity, oral contraceptive use, reproductive span, fetal microchimerism, stress, seasonal variation, allergy, smoking, radiation damage to the thyroid gland, viral and bacterial infections all play a role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disorders It has additionally been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.

Aren't there any HCV replication inhibitors available?,no,"We report here the discovery of the first small-molecule HCV infectivity inhibitor, GS-563253, also called HCV infectivity inhibitor 1 (HCV II-1).  Resistance to mericitabine (prodrug of HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor PSI-6130) is rare and conferred by the NS5B S282T mutation. We tested the ability of NA808 to inhibit SPT's enzymatic activity in FLR3-1 replicon cells The SPT inhibitor NA808 prevents replication of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a in cultured hepatocytes and in mice with humanized livers. Vaniprevir (phase III clinical trials) and MK-5172 (phase II clinical trials) are two potent antiviral compounds that target NS3/4A protease treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been significantly improved with the approval of the first two HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir (Incivek) and boceprevir (Victrelis).  Combination therapy with telaprevir and BMS-788329 (NS5A inhibitor) reduced serum HCV RNA to undetectable levels. The presence of an NS3-V36A telaprevir resistance mutation resulted in poor response to telaprevir monotherapy but showed significant HCV reduction when telaprevir was combined with BMS-788329. However, a BMS-788329-resistant strain emerged at low frequency.

Hasn't the presence of delayed enhancement been documented in athletes performing strenuous exercise?,no,"Atypical findings such as marked cardiac dilation, reduced deformation, or small patches of delayed gadolinium enhancement may be commonly encountered in well-trained athletes, but, at present, the prognostic significance of such findings is unknown.  On CMR, DGE localized to the interventricular septum was identified in 5 of 39 athletes who had greater cumulative exercise exposure and lower RVEF (47.1 ± 5.9 vs. 51.1 ± 3.7%, P = 0.042) than those with normal CMR. Post-event cardiac MRI demonstrated the interval appearance of delayed enhancement of gadolinium at the inferior insertion of the right ventricle and in the interventricular septum-a novel finding that may represent subtle inflammation secondary to a combined exercise and altitude effect. No evidence of delayed enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium was found on CMR imaging, suggesting that the increase in cardiac biomarkers after the marathon may not have be due to myocardial necrosis. Of the 102 runners, five had a CAD pattern of LGE, and seven had a non-CAD pattern of LGE. The CAD pattern of LGE was located in the territory of the left anterior descending coronary artery more frequently than was the non-CAD pattern (P = .0027, Fisher exact test). The prevalence of LGE in runners was higher than that in age-matched control subjects (12% vs 4%; P = .077, McNemar exact test)."
Are long non coding RNAs spliced?,yes,"Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. For alternative exons and long noncoding RNAs, splicing tends to occur later, and the latter might remain unspliced in some cases. bosome-mapping data to identify lncRNAs of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found 170 long intervening ncRNAs (lincRNAs), which had single- or multiexonic structures that did not overlap protein-coding transcripts, and about sixty antisense lncRNAs (ancRNAs), which were complementary to protein-coding transcripts We introduce an approach to predict spliced lncRNAs in vertebrate genomes combining comparative genomics and machine learning. Owing to similar alternative splicing pattern to mRNAs, the concept of lncRNA genes was put forward to help systematic understanding of lncRNAs.  Our synthesis of recent studies suggests that neither size, presence of a poly-A tail, splicing, direction of transcription, nor strand specificity are of importance to lncRNA function."
Does burning mouth syndrome preferentially affect post-mepopausal women?,yes,"It is observed principally in middle-aged patients and postmenopausal women and may be accompanied by xerostomia and altered taste. It occurs more commonly in middle-aged and elderly women and often affects the tongue tip and lateral borders, lips, and hard and soft palate.  BMS is a chronic disorder that frequently affects women and is characterised by burning symptoms of the oral mucosa without clinical signs. It mostly affects elderly citizens, especially postmenopausal women with prevalence up to 12-18%."
Is the protein product of the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) a deubiquitinating enzyme?,yes,"CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant predisposition to multiple benign neoplasms of the skin known as cylindromas. The CYLD protein is a deubiquitinating enzyme that acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB and JNK signaling through its interaction with NEMO and TNFR-associated factor 2. CYLD, a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), is a critical regulator of diverse cellular processes, ranging from proliferation and differentiation to inflammatory responses, via regulating multiple key signaling cascades such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. CYLD is a lysine 63-deubiquitinating enzyme that inhibits NF-κB and JNK signaling. Tumor suppressor gene CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme which negatively regulates various signaling pathways by removing the lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from several specific substrates. The cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that has been implicated in various aspects of adaptive and innate immune responses.  The cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) was identified as a tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (Brooke-Spiegler syndrome), an autosomal-dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme acting as a negative regulator of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway by removing lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains from NF-κB activating proteins.  Here, we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD, the familial cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene, as a negative regulator of proximal events in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. CYLD is a tumour-suppressor gene that is mutated in a benign skin tumour syndrome called cylindromatosis. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Cyld encodes a 956-amino acid deubiquitinating enzyme (CYLD), which is a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD has been identified as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB.  CYLD, a tumor suppressor gene, has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB. Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD is correlated with tumorigenesis. We show that dCYLD encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that deubiquitinates dTRAF2 and prevents dTRAF2 from ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB pathway activation. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) form a family of cysteine proteases that digests ubiquitin chains and reverses the process of protein ubiquitination. Despite the identification of a large number of DUBs, their physiological functions remain poorly defined. Here we provide genetic evidence that CYLD, a recently identified DUB, plays a crucial role in regulating the peripheral development and activation of B cells. The cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant condition that confers a predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. CYLD has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB. Therefore, loss of CYLD function correlates with tumorigenesis. Cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) is a ubiquitously expressed deubiquitinating enzyme, which interacts with members of the NF-κB signaling pathway and attenuates NF-κB and JNK signaling. The cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene (Cyld) encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme (CYLD) with immunoregulatory function. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Here, we examined the potential role of the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD (cylindromatosis), mutation of which has been reported to cause familial cylindromatosis. The deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD), loss of which was originally reported to cause a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, has been identified as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB in vitro. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) is a ubiquitously expressed deubiquitinating enzyme, which interacts with members of the NF-�B signaling pathway and attenuates NF-�B and JNK signaling. Cylindromatosis (CYLD) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is altered in patients with familial cylindromatosis, a condition characterized by numerous benign adnexal tumors. CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates NF-kappaB activation by TNFR family members.

Are transcription and splicing connected?,yes,", as splicing is often cotranscriptional, a complex picture emerges in which splicing regulation not only depends on the balance of splicing factor binding to their pre-mRNA target sites but also on transcription-associated features such as protein recruitment to the transcribing machinery and elongation kinetics. recent evidence shows that chromatin structure is another layer of regulation that may act through various mechanisms hese span from regulation of RNA polymerase II elongation, which ultimately determines splicing decisions, to splicing factor recruitment by specific histone marks. Chromatin may not only be involved in alternative splicing regulation but in constitutive exon recognition as well Moreover, splicing was found to be necessary for the proper 'writing' of particular chromatin signatures, giving further mechanistic support to functional interconnections between splicing, transcription and chromatin structure. These links between chromatin configuration and splicing raise the intriguing possibility of the existence of a memory for splicing patterns to be inherited through epigenetic modifications. Spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally, raising the possibility that DNA structure may directly influence alternative splicing. upporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. ere we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide We recently showed that cotranscriptional splicing occurs efficiently in Drosophila, In recent years it became apparent that splicing is predominantly cotranscriptional To determine the prevalence of cotranscriptional splicing in Drosophila, we sequenced nascent RNA transcripts from Drosophila S2 cells as well as from Drosophila heads. Eighty-seven percent of the introns assayed manifest >50% cotranscriptional splicing. The remaining 13% are cotranscriptionally spliced poorly or slowly, with ∼3% being almost completely retained in nascent pre-mRNA. We estimate that > or =90% of endogenous yeast splicing is posttranscriptional, consistent with an analysis of posttranscriptional snRNP-associated pre-mRNA. Notably, the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, which stalls elongating Pol II, increased cotranscriptional splicing factor accumulation and splicing in parallel. This provides direct evidence for a kinetic link between transcription, splicing factor recruitment and splicing catalysis. Recent evidence indicates that transcriptional elongation and splicing can be influenced reciprocally: Elongation rates control alternative splicing and splicing factors can, in turn, modulate pol II elongation. The presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and the existence of proteins, such as the coactivator PGC-1, with dual activities in splicing and transcription can explain the links between both processes and add a new level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes."
Isn't the yeast Μac1 transcription factor induced upon copper deficiency?,no,"Low-affinity copper transporter CTR2 is regulated by copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p Taken together, our results suggest that Mac1p can activate the expression of vacuolar copper transporter Ctr2p in response to copper deficiency, resulting in yeast resistance to copper starvation. The ablation of either MAC1 or AFT1 also abrogated CTR2 expression induced by copper depletion Our further study revealed that exogenous Aft1p upregulates CTR2 transcription only in the presence of Mac1p, whereas exogenous Mac1p upregulates CTR2 transcription only in the presence of Aft1p. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional responses to copper deficiency are mediated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1 Although Mac1 activates the transcription of genes involved in high affinity copper uptake during periods of deficiency, little is known about the mechanisms by which Mac1 senses or responds to reduced copper availability.  The catalytic activity of Sod1 is essential for Mac1 activation and promotes a regulated increase in binding of Mac1 to copper response elements in the promoter regions of genomic Mac1 target genes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copper ions regulate gene expression through the two transcriptional activators, Ace1 and Mac1. Ace1 mediates copper-induced gene expression in cells exposed to stressful levels of copper salts, whereas Mac1 activates a subset of genes under copper-deficient conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that Mac1p can activate the expression of vacuolar copper transporter Ctr2p in response to copper deficiency, resulting in yeast resistance to copper starvation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional responses to copper deficiency are mediated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p. The yeast Mac1 protein is a copper-sensing transcription factor that is essential for both the activation and inactivation of genes required for high affinity copper ion transport. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.  Copper-mediated repression of the activation domain in the yeast Mac1p transcription factor. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.  In this study, we found that copper depletion can upregulate yeast CTR2 gene transcription while copper overload downregulate it. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p."
Don't mutations of AKT1 occur in meningiomas?,no,"The recent identification of somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningiomas. A mutation in PIK3CA or AKT1 was found in around 9 % of the cases. AKT1E17K mutations cluster with meningothelial and transitional meningiomas and can be detected by SFRP1 immunohistochemistry. AKT1E17K mutations were exclusively seen in meningiomas and occurred in 65 of 958 of these tumors. A strong preponderance was seen in the variant of meningothelial meningioma WHO grade I of basal and spinal localization. In contrast, AKT1E17K mutations were rare in WHO grade II and absent in WHO grade III meningiomas.  We observed strong up-regulation of SFRP1 expression in all meningiomas with AKT1E17K mutation and in HEK293 cells after transfection with mutant AKT1E17K, but not in meningiomas and HEK293 cells lacking this mutation. SMO and AKT1 mutations occur in non-NF2 meningiomas. Recurrent mutations in SMO and AKT1 are mutually exclusive with NF2 loss in meningioma. Genomic sequencing of meningiomas identifies oncogenic SMO and AKT1 mutations.  A subset of meningiomas lacking NF2 alterations harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 (p.Glu17Lys) and SMO (p.Trp535Leu) and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of activation of these pathways.

Doesn't mTOR regulate the translation of MAPKAPK2?,no,"mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Senescent cells secrete a combination of factors collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP reinforces senescence and activates an immune surveillance response, but it can also show pro-tumorigenic properties and contribute to age-related pathologies. In a drug screen to find new SASP regulators, we uncovered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a potent SASP suppressor. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. In turn, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 during senescence, inhibiting its ability to degrade the transcripts of numerous SASP components. Consequently, mTOR inhibition or constitutive activation of ZFP36L1 impairs the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescent cells in both tumour-suppressive and tumour-promoting contexts. Altogether, our results place regulation of the SASP as a key mechanism by which mTOR could influence cancer, age-related diseases and immune responses. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1 Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1.

Is Meis1 implicated in microphthalmia?,yes,"Meis1 coordinates a network of genes implicated in eye development and microphthalmia. Here we show that haploinsufficiency of Meis1, which encodes a transcription factor with evolutionarily conserved expression in the embryonic trunk, brain and sensory organs, including the eye, causes microphthalmic traits and visual impairment in adult mice. We propose that Meis1 is at the core of a genetic network implicated in eye patterning/microphthalmia, and represents an additional candidate for syndromic cases of these ocular malformations.

Has silicon been used in treatment of  incontinence ?,yes,"an artificial anal sphincter. Worldwide, there are two established devices on the market: the artificial bowel sphincter® (ABS) from A. M. S. (Minnetonka, MN, USA) and the soft anal band® from A. M. I. (Feldkirch, Austria). How to implant the artificial anal sphincter? Both devices consist of a silicon cuff which can be filled with fluid. The InVance™ system uses a silicon-coated polyester sling positioned under the bulbar urethra via a perineal incision. Through a perineal incision three titanium screws with a polipropylene suture were inserted in each ischiopubic rami, and a silicon/polipropylene mesh (Invance) is affixed to them, compressing the bulbar urethra surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with a trans-obturator sub-urethral tape of Uratape (Porgés). METHODS: Treatment and follow up of their complication were performed at the CHRU of Lille. RESULTS: In both cases, this complication is related to prolonged vaginal exposition of the tape. Vaginal erosion always occurs next to the silicon coated section of the tape A non-elastic, polypropylene tape (UraTape, Mentor-Porgès) with a silicon coated central part was placed under the mid-urethra.  Stress incontinence is a rare complication in men, usually following prostatic surgery. It can be treated conservatively with pelvic floor training and alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists and if necessary surgically with submucosal collagen or silicon injections in the sphincter area or implantation of a sphincter prosthesis The Femassist is a medical-grade silicon dome-shaped device, worn over the urethra and held securely via suction and a commercially available adhesive lotion. To examine the performance of a silicon urinary control device for nonsurgical management of women with genuine stress incontinence The ""FemAssist"" is a dome-shaped medical grade silicon device intended to be worn over the external urethral meatus and held in place by suction and an adhesive gel. Thirty eight women with varying degrees of genuine stress urinary incontinence (GSUI) or mixed incontinence on multichannel urodynamic testing were fitted with one of two sizes of ""FemAssist"
Are there any urine biomarkers for chronic kidney disease?,yes,"Kidney and urine proteomic biomarkers are considered as promising diagnostic tools to predict CKD progression early in diabetic nephropathy, facilitating timely and selective intervention that may reduce the related health-care expenditures. Both blood and urine biomarkers are reviewed in this paper and offer a considerable opportunity to enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology and known epidemiology of these recently defined syndromes. Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have been subclassified as five defined entities which represent clinical circumstances in which both the heart and the kidney are involved in a bidirectional injury and dysfunction via a final common pathway of cell-to-cell death and accelerated apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress. There is a strong association between both acute and chronic dysfunction of the heart and kidneys with respect to morbidity and mortality. Both blood and urine biomarkers, including the assessment of catalytic iron, a critical element to the generation of oxygen-free radicals and oxidative stress, are reviewed in this paper. Identification of urine biomarkers has proven to be beneficial in recent years because of ease of handling, stability, and the ability to standardize the various markers to creatinine or other peptides generally already present in the urine. Recent markers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and podocin have garnered a lot of attention. The emergence of these and other biomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic applications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease."

Are Ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) enriched in segmental duplications?,no,"Here we address the process by which CNVs become depleted of UCEs. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state.  ULEs are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications. Interestingly, human UCEs have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs). In addition, here we show that these elements are preferentially found in pathogenic deletions (enrichment ratio 3.6 vs. 0.5 in duplications), and that this association is not related with a higher content of genes. In contrast, pathogenic CNVs lacking UCEs showed almost a threefold higher content in genes We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. Mammalian ultraconserved elements are strongly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Notably, of the UCEs that are found in segmental duplications or copy number variants, the majority overlap exons, indicating, along with other findings presented, that UCEs overlapping exons represent a distinct subset. Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are strongly depleted from segmental duplications and copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome, suggesting that deletion or duplication of a UCE can be deleterious to the mammalian cell. Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are strongly depleted from segmental duplications and copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome, suggesting that deletion or duplication of a UCE can be deleterious to the mammalian cell melanogaster genome revealed depletion of the P-element and piggyBac insertions in and around the Sophophora UCEs. Mammalian ultraconserved elements are strongly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Interestingly, human UCEs have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs)."
Aren't Sidekick proteins members of the immunoglobulin superfamily?,no,"Here we show that four closely related immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) adhesion molecules--Dscam (Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule), DscamL (refs 6-9), Sidekick-1 and Sidekick-2 Sidekick-1, a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is up-regulated in glomerular podocytes in the collapsing glomerulopathy of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)."
Does d-tubocurarine (d-TC) induces irreversible inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction?,no,"An integrated model describing the interaction of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents with reversible anticholinesterase agents is derived and compared with a naive model using experimental data obtained from four anesthetized dogs. Three consecutive but separate steady-state d-tubocurarine blocks (approximately 50, 70, and 90%) were induced in each of the four dogs and reversed by short edrophonium infusions. The ability of hexamethonium (C6) to reverse the neuromuscular blocking action of tubocurarine (Tc) Volatile anesthetics enhance the neuromuscular blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMRs). The neuromuscular junction is a postulated site of this interaction. We tested the hypothesis that volatile anesthetic enhancement of muscle relaxation is the result of combined drug effects on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Concentration-effect curves for the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents were established for vecuronium, d-tubocurarine, isoflurane, and sevoflurane. Subsequently, inhibitory effects of NDMRs were studied in the presence of the volatile anesthetics at a concentration equivalent to half the concentration producing a 50% inhibition alone. All individually tested compounds produced rapid and readily reversible concentration-dependent inhibition. The pharmacological diversity of the different isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor arises from the diversity of the subunits that assemble to form the native receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine in a reversible manner.  As further evidence of anticholinesterase activity, methamidophos (1-100 microM) was able to reverse the blockade by d-tubocurarine There was an initial partial reversal of the neuromuscular inhibition caused by tubocurarine Isoflurane and sevoflurane enhance the receptor blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Because other purinergic 2X (P2X) receptor antagonists, NF023 and NF279, do not have the reverse effects on the neuromuscular blockade of d-TC, the effect of NF449 seems irrelevant to inhibition of P2X receptors. The association rate constant for Tc binding to sites on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor appears to be very fast (k+D = 8.9 x 10(8) M-1 s-1) and comparable to that for acetylcholine (ACh). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism for the reversal effect of NF449 (a suramin analogue) on the neuromuscular block induced by d-tubocurarine (d-TC). Study of the reversal effect of NF449 on neuromuscular blockade induced by d-tubocurarine."
Can a given genotype exhibit opposite fitness effects (beneficial and detrimental) within the same environment?,yes,"Mutations beneficial in one environment may cause costs in different environments, resulting in antagonistic pleiotropy. Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates. The hfq mutations were beneficial, deleterious or neutral at an intermediate growth rate (0.5 h(-1)) and one changed from beneficial to deleterious within a 36 min difference in doubling time. Two genetic models exist to explain the evolution of ageing - mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). Under AP, late-acting deleterious mutations accumulate because they confer beneficial effects early in life. Many marker loci responded in opposite directions to selection for late- and early-life fitness, indicating negative genetic correlations or trade-offs between those traits. Indirect evidence suggested that some negative genetic correlations were due to antagonistic pleiotropy. Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates. The basis of antagonistic pleiotropy in hfq mutations that have opposite effects on fitness at slow and fast growth rates. Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates"
Isn't autophagy modulated in a circadian fashion?,no,"TOR signaling pathway and autophagy are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in behavior and plasticity of L2 interneurons in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster.  Our results indicate that the TOR signaling pathway and autophagy are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in the behavior and plasticity of neurons in the brain of adult flies. the pathways of autophagy, mTOR, SIRT1, and Wnt that control mammalian circadian rhythm Metabolic pathways, bile acid synthesis, and autophagic and immune/inflammatory processes are driven by the biological clock.  our findings suggest that the clock geneBmal1is a positive regulator of autophagy through the mTOR signaling pathway and protects cardiomyocytes against high-glucose toxicity. Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation system, and recently was shown to display circadian rhythms in mice."
Are paralog genes co-regulated?,yes,"Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. In eukaryotes, genes are regulated in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters. These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization. Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs. Analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster testes transcriptome reveals coordinate regulation of paralogous genes. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.<br> Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances.  MiRNA genes are often subject to co-evolutionary changes together with their target transcripts, which may be reflected by differences between paralog mouse and primate miRNA/mRNA pairs. We characterize the collapse over time through the distribution of runs of reduced paralog pairs in duplicated segments. In addition, we identified 81 co-regulated regions on the human genome (RIDGEs) by using expression data from all cancers. Some RIDGEs (28%) consist of paralog genes while another subset (30%) are specifically dysregulated in tumors but not in normal tissues. We conclude that the similarity of hoxb3a/Hoxa3 regulatory mechanisms reflect the shared descent of both genes from a single ancestral paralog group 3 gene. Conserved co-regulation and promoter sharing of hoxb3a and hoxb4a in zebrafish. By analyzing paralogs of testis-biased genes, we identified ""co-regulated"" paralogous pairs in which both genes are testis biased, ""anti-regulated"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other downregulated in testes, and ""neutral"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other constitutively expressed."
Doesn't Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) show a bias for highly expressed loci?,no,"However, several issues in the processing and analysis of ChIP-chip data have not been resolved fully, including the effect of background (mock control) subtraction and normalization within and across arrays  Proper normalization is essential for ChIP-chip experiments. The proposed normalization technique can correct systematic errors and compensate for the lack of mock control data, thus reducing the experimental cost and producing more accurate results. Subtraction of the mock (non-specific antibody or no antibody) control data is generally needed to eliminate the bias, but appropriate normalization obviates the need for mock experiments and increases the correlation among replicates The proposed method can handle several control samples allowing for correction of multiple sources of bias simultaneously However, the data generated will always contain noise due to e.g. repetitive regions or non-specific antibody interactions The generation of high copy numbers of DNA fragments as an artifact of the PCR step in ChIP-seq is an important source of bias of this methodology Here we describe several technical aspects of the ChIP-Seq assay that diminish bias and background noise and allow the consistent generation of high-quality data  This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques We detected a chromatin-state bias: open chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not corrected This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any base-composition bias This problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because of the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods We investigated the impact of library amplification bias on the identification of allele-specific (AS) molecular events from high-throughput sequencing data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-seq) The 238 loci, termed ""hyper-ChIPable"", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations"
Is autophagy the process where bacteria ingest viral particles?,yes,"Autophagy, a cellular degradation process Autophagy, a form of lysosomal degradation capable of eliminating dysfunctional proteins and organelles, is a cellular process associated with homeostasis. Autophagy, a programmed process in which cell contents are delivered to lysosomes for degradation, appears to have both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting functions; both stimulation and inhibition of autophagy have been reported to induce cancer cell death, and particular genes and proteins have been associated both positively and negatively with autophagy Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated catabolic process involving the degradation of intracellular contents (e.g., proteins and organelles) as well as invading microbes (e.g., parasites, bacteria and viruses). Autophagy is a cellular process that targets proteins, lipids and organelles to lysosomes for degradation, but it has also been shown to combat infection with various pathogenic bacteria. Autophagy, an intracellular degradation process highly conserved from yeast to humans, is viewed as an important defence mechanism to clear intracellular bacteria. Autophagy has intracellular anti-viral and anti-bacterial functions, and plays a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system responses to viral and bacterial infections. documented abundant autophagy within VZV-infected cells throughout the infectious cycle but also demonstrated that VZV-induced autophagy facilitated VZV glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing. Autophagy is a highly conserved process by which cells can recycle organelles and proteins by degrading them in the lysosomes."
Does Yersinia pestis causes a respiratory infection?,yes,"Inhalation of Yersinia pestis results in primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal and rapidly progressing necrotizing pneumonia Yersinia pestis causes the fatal respiratory disease pneumonic plague. Pulmonary infection by Yersinia pestis causes pneumonic plague, a rapidly progressing and often fatal disease. Pulmonary infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis causes pneumonic plague, an often-fatal disease for which no vaccine is presently available. Yersinia pestis causes the fatal respiratory disease pneumonic plague Pneumonic plague is a deadly respiratory disease caused by Yersinia pestis On July 8, 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) laboratory identified Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, in a blood specimen collected from a man (patient A) hospitalized with pneumonia. Early emergence of Yersinia pestis as a severe respiratory pathogen. The aerosol form of the bacterium Yersinia pestis causes the pneumonic plague, a rapidly fatal disease  plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, has historically been regarded as one of the deadliest pathogens known to mankind, having caused three major pandemics. After being transmitted by the bite of an infected flea arthropod vector, Y. pestis can cause three forms of human plague: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, Plague is an infectious disease caused by the Yersinia pestis microorganism, which is transmitted to the human host from a natural reservoir (different rodent species) by a flea bite. Plague is still encountered in humans in the areas of its enzootic prevalence in local rodent populations. Infection by flea bite results in a bubonic or septicemic plague, possibly complicated by secondary pneumonia. The person with pneumonic symptoms may be a source of a droplet-borne inhalatory infection for other people who consequently develop primary pneumonic plague.  uring pneumonic plague, the bacterium Yersinia pestis elicits the development of inflammatory lung lesions that continue to expand throughout infection.  In November 2006, the Uganda Ministry of Health received reports of an increase in bubonic plague cases and a possible outbreak of pneumonic plague among residents in the Arua and Nebbi districts.  Pneumonic plague is a fatal disease caused by Yersinia pestis that is associated with a delayed immune response in the lungs"
Isn't lumican a secreted protein?,no,fibroblasts stimulated with the fibrocyte-secreted inflammatory signal tumor necrosis factor-α secrete the small leucine-rich proteoglycan lumican TNF-α-stimulated fibroblasts secrete lumican to promote fibrocyte differentiation. Secreted 70kDa lumican stimulates growth and inhibits invasion of human pancreatic cancer. the elevated level of lumican secretion to extracellular space leads to actin cytoskeletal remodeling followed by an increase in migration capacity of human colon LS180 cells Lumican is a secreted proteoglycan that regulates collagen fibril assembly.

Is it feasible to determine the complete proteome of yeast?,yes,"or model organisms like yeast, we can now quantify complete proteomes in just a few hours. A complete mass-spectrometric map of the yeast proteome applied to quantitative trait analysis. So far, attempts to generate such maps for any proteome have failed to reach complete proteome coverage.

Isn't there evidence for somatic mosaicism in Tuberous Sclerosis?,no,"There are several case reports of solitary SEGA without any other manifestations of TSC. Usually these cases are thought to be forme fruste of TSC due to somatic mosaicism. Female germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis confirmed by molecular genetic analysis This is the first case of germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis proven by molecular genetic analysis and also the first example of female germline mosaicism for a characterized autosomal dominant gene mutation apparently not associated with somatic mosaicism. Mutation screening by RT-PCR and direct sequencing of the TSC2 gene identified a 4 bp insertion TACT following nucleotide 2077 in exon 18 which was present in the three affected children but not in five unaffected siblings or the parents. This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother."
Aren't sleep apnea and snoring associated with cardiac arrhythmias?,no,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common breathing disorder, is an independent risk factor for AF. There is a growing consensus in the scientific community that suggests a strong association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular (CVD) conditions and events, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.  part from well-established risk factors that increase the odds for the development of AF, e.g. age or arterial hypertension, recent analyses indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may independently, negatively modify the arrhythmia occur-rence profile.  Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke. Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.<br> Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation. Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting 5-15% of the population. It is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that disrupts normal ventilation and sleep architecture, and is typically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea present risk to the general public safety by causing 8-fold increase in vehicle accidents, and they may themselves also suffer from the physiologic consequences of OSA; these include hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias Obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration                     are associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia.  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects approximately 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in patients with OSA, even though the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined.  Cardiac arrhythmias during wakefulness and sleep in 15 patients with sleep-induced obstructive apnea, and the effect of atropine and tracheostomy on these arrhythmias were studied by continuous overnight Holter electrocardiographic, respiratory and electroencephalographic recordings. obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as its most extreme variant, is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway, leading to cessation of breathing while asleep. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in OSA patients, although the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined The mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea include abrupt changes in autonomic tone, which can trigger cardiac arrhythmias.   Recent studies have shown that cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders are common in patients with SA. Sleep apnea Severity of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias correlates with intensity of sleep apnea in men Patients affected with OSA are frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with stable cardiac failure who snore may present sleep hypopnea and cardiac arrhythmias.   Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA.  Nocturnal hypoxia has been associated with serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as life-threatening bradyarrhythmias. Obesity and snoring, both of which increase with age, have been identified as risk factors for sleep-related breathing disorders, as have hypertension and heart disease. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with excess daytime sleepiness, depression, and an increased incidence of ischemic cardiopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension and brain infarction. We found 58 percent prevalence of arrhythmias in patients with sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index = AHI>10), vs 42 percent in nonapneic controls (chi 2 = 16.7, p<0.0001)"
Is Rucaparib effective for ovarian cancer?,yes,"INTERPRETATION: In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. High LOH is associated with response to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in BRCA wild-type ovarian cancer. Rucaparib Approved for Ovarian Cancer.

Is there any role of TBR1 in autism?,yes,"TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex Exome sequencing studies have identified multiple genes harboring de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including TBR1, a master regulator of cortical development. We performed ChIP-seq for TBR1 during mouse cortical neurogenesis and show that TBR1-bound regions are enriched adjacent to ASD genes. ASD genes were also enriched among genes that are differentially expressed in Tbr1 knockouts, which together with the ChIP-seq data, suggests direct transcriptional regulation. Of the nine ASD genes examined, seven were misexpressed in the cortices of Tbr1 knockout mice, including six with increased expression in the deep cortical layers. ASD genes with adjacent cortical TBR1 ChIP-seq peaks also showed unusually low levels of LoF mutations in a reference human population and among Icelanders. We then leveraged TBR1 binding to identify an appealing subset of candidate ASD genes. Our findings highlight a TBR1-regulated network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations, indicating that these genes may play critical roles in normal cortical development. T-Brain-1--A Potential Master Regulator in Autism Spectrum Disorders. T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. The downstream genes of TBR1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses. In this study, we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches. Of 124 TBR1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with ASDs. Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. A further five of the 24 genes (Cd44, Cdh8, Cntn6, Gpc6, and Ntng1) encode membrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth. These genes likely contribute to the role of TBR1 in regulation of neuronal migration and axonal extension. Besides, decreases in Grin2b expression and increases in Gad1 expression imply that neuronal activity may be aberrant in Tbr1 deficient mice. These analyses provide direction for future experiments to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of autism. The activity-regulated gene expression of transcription factors is required for neural plasticity and function in response to neuronal stimulation. T-brain-1 (TBR1), a critical neuron-specific transcription factor for forebrain development, has been recognized as a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorders.  Disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been repeatedly identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  Next-generation sequencing recently revealed that recurrent disruptive mutations in a few genes may account for 1% of sporadic autism cases. Coupling these novel genetic data to empirical assays of protein function can illuminate crucial molecular networks. Here we demonstrate the power of the approach, performing the first functional analyses of TBR1 variants identified in sporadic autism. T-brain-1 (TBR1) is a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. In 1995, Tbr1 was first identified from a subtractive hybridization that compared mouse embryonic and adult telencephalons. Previous studies of Tbr1 (-∕-) mice have indicated critical roles for TBR1 in the development of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. Neuronal migration and axonal projection are two important developmental features controlled by TBR1. Recently, recurrent de novo disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been found in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Human genetic studies have identified TBR1 as a high-confidence risk factor for ASDs. TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex. De novo TBR1 mutations in sporadic autism disrupt protein functions. In humans, PAX6, EOMES, and TBR1 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. Neuronal excitation upregulates Tbr1, a high-confidence risk gene of autism, mediating Grin2b expression in the adult brain.

Aren't there ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast?,no,"Here, we present a systematic study of ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast based on the publicly available genome sequences, in order to reveal their relationship with the adaptability or fitness advantages of the budding yeast.Results: Our results indicate that, in addition to some fundamental biological functions, the UCSs play an important role in the adaptation of S. cerevisiae to the acidic environment, which is backed up by the previous observation. Besides that, we also find the highly unchanged genes (HUGs) are enriched in some other pathways, such as the nutrient-sensitive signaling pathway. To facilitate the investigation of unique UCSs, the UCSC Genome Browser was utilized to visualize the chromosomal position and related annotations of UCSs in S. cerevisiae genome.

Isn't fatigue prevalent in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma?,no,"By contrast, fatigue worsened over time, with a difference in mean score of 5.6 points between baseline and 4-month follow-up (P=.02). In the GB cohort, the most common side effects were fatigue (56 %), diarrhea (44 %), neutropenia (31 %), and thrombocytopenia (25 %).  A total of 37 patients were treated, and treatment was well tolerated: grade 3, 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 30% of patients and consisted mainly of fatigue (14%) and neuropathy (5%); grade 3, 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 37% of patients and consisted of thrombocytopenia (30%), lymphopenia (4%), and neutropenia (4%).  Nonhematologic Grade 3 toxicity was rare, and included fatigue in 4 patients and cognitive disability in 1 patient. The most common grade 3 events were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and infection in 25, 20, 13, and 10%, respectively.  Analysis of the results of the VAS Norris scale did not demonstrate an increase in emotional fatigue but did show an increase in physical fatigue that did not reach statistical significance. With regards to the MFI 20 tool, analysis of the results demonstrated a significant increase in general (P=0.0260) as well as physical (P=0.0141) fatigue but there was no difference in the other indices. This study demonstrated a progressive increase in physical fatigue in patients with glioblastoma relapse treated with irinotecan-bevacizumab.  One patient treated with temozolomide plus isotretinoin plus thalidomide had dose-limiting grade 3 fatigue and rash, and 1 patient receiving all 4 agents had dose-limiting grade 4 neutropenia.  The toxicities observed were primarily grade 1 and 2, and the most common were fatigue, hypertension, and headache.  Fatigue (41%), rash (62%), and loose stools (58%) constituted the most frequent adverse events, the majority of these being limited to Grade 1/2.  The most common grades 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were nausea/vomiting (6.7%) and fatigue (5.8%).  Grade 3/4 toxicities included leukopenia (n = 1), lymphopenia (n = 2), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), ALT elevation (n = 3), AST elevation (n = 1), CNS hemorrhage (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), and thrombotic/embolic events (n = 3); 8 patients required dose reduction.  The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events were fatigue (7%), neutropaenia (7%), and thrombocytopaenia (7%). Bevacizumab-related toxicity included fatigue (16 patients; 4 grade 3), leukopenia (9; 1 grade 3), anemia (5; 0 grade 3), hypertension (7; 1 grade 3), deep vein thrombosis (4; 1 grade 3) and wound dehiscence (2; 1 grade 3).  Tiredness may be caused by the brain injury due to the tumor or the treatment in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Some patients describe a sense of tiredness particularly after radiation or oral chemotherapy. Levels of tiredness in patients with GBM were greatly affected by the radiotherapy and oral chemotherapy (temozolomide). The treatment had no negative effect on HRQOL, however, fatigue (P = 0.02) and constipation (P = 0.01) scales worsened over time.  This regimen was well tolerated with grade 3/4 toxicities of fatigue, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and rash requiring dose reductions.  The most common atrasentan-related toxicities were grade 1 or 2 rhinitis, fatigue, and edema. One patient developed Grade IV fatigue at the 100 ng/mL dose, but the MTD has not been established.  Side-effects in all patients have included varying degrees of anorexia, fatigue, ipsilateral forehead dermatitis, blepharitis, and conjunctivitis.   Some patients suffered from fatigue and weak concentration about three months after the end of radiotherapy, in some cases even the neurologic state was deteriorated.  grade 1-2 common toxicities included fever, chills, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and headache, neutrophilia and skin painful reactions appeared regularly at levels 3 and 4 (2.5 mg and 3.5 mg).  Ten episodes of grade 3/4 adverse events were observed in nine patients, including fatigue (n = 3), thrombocytopenia (n = 4), and myelotoxicity, febrile neutropenia, and pulmonary embolism (each n = 1). Common adverse events were CTCAE grade 1-2 fatigue, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and nausea. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were venous thrombosis, fatigue, skin reactions, encephalopathy, and neuropathy."
Aren't there RNAi approaches considered for the treatment of kidney injury?,no,"Herein, we describe ammonium-functionalized carbon nanotube (fCNT)-mediated transport of siRNA selectively and with high efficiency to renal proximal tubule cells in animal models of acute kidney injury (AKI). fCNT enhanced siRNA delivery to tubule cells compared to siRNA alone and effectively knocked down the expression of several target genes, includingTrp53,Mep1b,Ctr1, andEGFP A clinically relevant cisplatin-induced murine model of AKI was used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of fCNT-targeted siRNA to effectively halt the pathogenesis of renal injury.  The nanocarbon-mediated delivery of siRNA provides a therapeutic means for the prevention of AKI to safely overcome the persistent barrier of nephrotoxicity during medical intervention."
Is there any cross-talk between the Wnt and the Akt pathways?,yes,"Our data demonstrate that engaging Wnt signaling at the receptor level by this method leads to necessary crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways including activation of Akt, mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, PKA/CREB, and inhibition of RhoA/ROCK that substantially increase human β-cell proliferation while maintaining the β-cell phenotype. The cross-talk role of Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with GSK-3β as the key enzyme bridging these pathways, may contribute to the inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cells by hUC-MSCs. We find that Wnt stimulation leads to phosphorylation of insulin signaling key mediators, including Akt, GSK3β, and ERK1/2, although with a lower fold stimulation and slower time course than observed for insulin. Wnt induces phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3β, and this is dependent on insulin/IGF-1 receptors. Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K resulted in the downregulation of several members of the β-catenin pathway, including Fra-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Similar results were observed in vivo, as intratumoral injection of LY294002 downregulated the expression of the components of the β-catenin pathway and delayed tumor growth in nude mice harboring subcutaneous LN229 xenografts. These results suggest that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates glioma cell proliferation, in part via repression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Small-molecule inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin pathway cross-talk and suppress medulloblastoma growth Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway affected beta-catenin signaling by activation [corrected] of GSK-3beta, [corrected] resulting in cytoplasmic retention of beta-catenin and reduced expression of its target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. These findings demonstrate the importance of cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and beta-catenin pathways in medulloblastoma and rationalize the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in treatment of this disease. Western blot analyses revealed that the recombinant Wnt ligand Wnt-3A increased phosphorylation of AKT and the downstream kinase glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta as well as accumulation of activated, nuclear beta-catenin. Chemical inhibition of PI3K abolished Wnt-dependent phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3beta and trophoblast motility but did not affect appearance of activated beta-catenin or Wnt/TCF reporter activity. The data suggest that Wnt-3A may activate canonical Wnt signaling and PI3K/AKT through distinct receptors. Mutational activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway occurs in a wide variety of tumors, whereas activating Wnt pathway mutants are predominantly found in colon cancer. Because GSK3 is a key component of both pathways, it is widely assumed that active PI3K signaling feeds positively into the Wnt pathway by protein kinase B (PKB)-mediatefd inhibition of GSK3. n addition, PKB has been proposed to modulate the canonical Wnt signaling through direct stabilization and nuclear localization of beta-catenin. Here, we show that compartmentalization by Axin of GSK3 prohibits cross-talk between the PI3K and Wnt pathways and that Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity is not modulated by activation of the PI3K/PKB pathway. Our recent study revealed a second mechanism for Cby-mediated beta-catenin inhibition in which Cby cooperates with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins to facilitate nuclear export of beta-catenin, following phosphorylation of Cby by Akt kinase. Therefore, our findings unravel a novel molecular mechanism regulating the dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of beta-catenin and provide new insights into the cross-talk between the Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. Here, we review recent literature concerning Cby function and discuss our current understanding of the relationship between Wnt and Akt signaling. As inappropriate activation of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling causes late-onset GCT development and cross talk between the PI3K/AKT and WNT/CTNNB1 pathways has been reported, we tested whether these pathways could synergize in GCT. This explains why prostate tumors subjected to androgen ablation experience an increase in Akt phosphorylation, and suggest that the tumor compensates for the loss of one pathway with another. Different modes of interaction between the two pathways, including direct interaction, or regulation via downstream intermediates, such as the wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway, NF-kappaB, and the FOXO family of transcription factors, will be discussed. FGF signals are transduced through FGF receptor to the FRS2-GRB2-GAB1-PI3K-AKT signaling cascade to downregulate GSK3beta activity depending on Ser 9 phosphorylation. Because GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin and SNAIL leads to FBXW1 (betaTRCP)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, GSK3beta downregulation results in the stabilization and the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and SNAIL. Bridging the BMP and Wnt pathways by PI3 kinase/Akt and 14-3-3zeta Concurrently, PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, is also primarily inactivated in the ISCs, leading to activation of Akt. Thus, Akt may contribute to activation of beta-catenin in ISCs in coordination with Wnt signaling. Thus, we propose that BMP signaling plays a role in inhibition of ISC self-renewal through suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ISC, and this cross-talk is bridged, at least in part, through the PTEN/Akt pathway and further enforced by 14-3-3zeta. In MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cultures, dexamethasone (DEX) activates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) and inhibits a differentiation-related cell cycle that occurs at a commitment stage immediately after confluence. Here we show that DEX inhibition of the differentiation-related cell cycle is associated with a decrease in beta-catenin levels and inhibition of LEF/TCF-mediated transcription. These inhibitory activities are no longer observed in the presence of lithium, a GSK3beta inhibitor. DEX decreased the serum-responsive phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt-Ser(473) within minutes, and this inhibition was also observed after 12 h. When the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway was inhibited by wortmannin, DEX no longer inhibited beta-catenin levels. Furthermore, DEX-mediated inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity was attenuated in the presence of dominant negative forms of either PI3K or protein kinase B/Akt. These results suggest cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. These results suggest that inhibition of a PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin/LEF axis and stimulation of HDAC1 cooperate to mediate the inhibitory effect of DEX on Wnt signaling and the osteoblast differentiation-related cell cycle. WISP-1 (Wnt-1-induced secreted protein) was identified as an oncogene regulated by the Wnt-1-beta-catenin pathway. Here it is shown that WISP-1 can activate the antiapoptotic Akt/PKB signaling pathway.  Our results show that both TGFβ1 and Wnt3a lead to increased accumulation of β-catenin, phosphorylation of AKT and p44/42 MAPK."
Is airplane stroke syndrome a common disease.,no,"Only 37 cases of stroke during or soon after long-haul flights have been published to our knowledge.  Our centre admitted 5727 stroke patients, of whom 42 (0.73%) had flight-related strokes. The authors report three cases of ischemic stroke in young adults that occurred during or after an airplane flight."
Aren't alterations in ultraconserved elements associated with colorectal adenocarcinoma?,no,"Genetic variants within ultraconserved elements and susceptibility to right- and left-sided colorectal adenocarcinoma Our results strongly suggest that several genetic variants in the UCEs may contribute to CRC susceptibility, individually and jointly, and that different genetic etiology may be involved in RCRC and LCRC Identification of polymorphisms in ultraconserved elements associated with clinical outcomes in locally advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the association between SNPs within UCEs and clinical outcome in patients with CRC. The results suggested that SNPs within UCEs may be valuable prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced CRC who receive 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy Identification of polymorphisms in ultraconserved elements associated with clinical outcomes in locally advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma. Genetic variants within ultraconserved elements and susceptibility to right- and left-sided colorectal adenocarcinoma. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms within ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are associated with susceptibility to overall colorectal cancer (CRC) and susceptibility to tumor site-specific CRC.

Is there any link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates?,yes,"Some of the most highly conserved sequences occur in genes encoding RNA binding proteins, particularly the RNA splicing-associated SR genes. Differences in sequence conservation between plants and animals are likely to reflect differences in the biology of the organisms, with plants being much more able to tolerate genomic deletions and whole-genome duplication events due, in part, to their far greater fecundity compared with vertebrates."
Are there conserved noncoding elements identified between genomes of human and teleosts?,yes,"We report evidence for a mechanism for the maintenance of long-range conserved synteny across vertebrate genomes. We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated ""bystander"" genes After whole genome duplication in teleosts, GRBs, including HCNEs and target genes, were often maintained in both copies, while bystander genes were typically lost from one GRB, strongly suggesting that evolutionary pressure acts to keep the single-copy GRBs of higher vertebrates intact. We show that loss of bystander genes and other mutational events suffered by duplicated GRBs in teleost genomes permits target gene identification and HCNE/target gene assignment Vertebrate genomes contain thousands of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) that often function as tissue-specific enhancers. In this study, we have identified CNEs in human, dog, chicken, Xenopus, and four teleost fishes (zebrafish, stickleback, medaka, and fugu) using elephant shark, a cartilaginous vertebrate, as the base genome and investigated the evolution of these ancient vertebrate CNEs (aCNEs) in bony vertebrate lineages This implicates the ""fish-specific"" whole-genome duplication in the accelerated evolution and the loss of a large number of both copies of duplicated CNEs in teleost fishes We found zebrafish conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) with pan-vertebrate as well as fish-specific orthologous sequences from across 200 kb of the zebrafish fgf8a genomic regulatory block to direct reporter expression in patterns consistent with the expression pattern of fgf8a  A significant number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) shared between cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods have diverged beyond recognition in teleost fishes. The divergence of CNEs seems to have been initiated in basal ray-finned fishes before the WGD. The fast evolving singleton and duplicated genes as well as the divergent CNEs might have contributed to the diversity of teleost fishes We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated ""bystander"" genes. Ancient vertebrate conserved noncoding elements have been evolving rapidly in teleost fishes. A significant number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) shared between cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods have diverged beyond recognition in teleost fishes. We have used a transposon-based transgenic assay in zebrafish to evaluate noncoding sequences at the zebrafish ret locus, conserved among teleosts, and at the human RET locus, conserved among mammals. Using computational analysis and exploiting the diversity of teleost genomes, we identified a cluster of highly conserved noncoding sequences surrounding the Six3 gene"
Does thyroid hormone signaling don't affect microRNAs expression in the heart?,no,"e show that the heart regulates systemic energy homeostasis via MED13, a subunit of the Mediator complex, which controls transcription by thyroid hormone and other nuclear hormone receptors. MED13, in turn, is negatively regulated by a heart-specific microRNA, miR-208a. On the other hand, T₃ treatment increased miR-350 expression. Through a bioinformatics screening using TargetScan, we identified thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1), which negatively regulates β-MHC transcription, as a target of miR-27a hese findings suggested that miR-27a regulates β-MHC gene expression by targeting TRβ1 in cardiomyocytes. We found that a cardiac-specific microRNA (miR-208) encoded by an intron of the alphaMHC gene is required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and expression of betaMHC in response to stress and hypothyroidism. Moreover, miR-27a was demonstrated to modulate β-MHC gene regulation via thyroid hormone signaling and to be upregulated during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells or in hypertrophic hearts in association with β-MHC gene upregulation."
Can canagliflozin cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis?,yes,"CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking a combination of canagliflozin and metformin who presented with progressive altered mental status over the previous 2 days. Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose>500 mg/dL and ketones of 80 mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93 mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids, and the metabolic abnormalities and her altered mental status resolved within 36 h. This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis. Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis.  Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis with Persistent Diuresis Treated with Canagliflozin. We herein report the case of a 27-year-old Asian woman with type 2 diabetes who was treated with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (canagliflozin) who developed euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis and persistent diuresis in the absence of hyperglycemia. Canagliflozin raised the risk of amputations and the rate of fractures in the CANVAS trial, although more data are necessary before drawing definite conclusions. The risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis seems to be minimal when the drugs are prescribed properly. Severe Ketoacidosis Associated with Canagliflozin (Invokana): A Safety Concern.  However, some serious side effects, including severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), have been reported.  At present, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved three medications (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) in this drug class for the management of Type 2 diabetes. In May 2015, the FDA issued a warning of ketoacidosis with use of this drug class. We present a case of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to canagliflozin in a type 2 diabetic patient.

"Has ""RNA interference"" been awarded Nobel prize?",yes,"Since the first unequivocal description of RNA interference (RNAi) in 1998, it has remained one of the hottest topics under investigation, culminating in the award of a Nobel Prize to its discoverers in 2006. RNA interference (RNAi) is considered one of the most powerful genomic tools which allows the study of drug discovery and understanding of the complex cellular processes by high-content screens. This field of study, which was the subject of 2006 Nobel Prize of medicine, has drastically changed the conventional methods of analysis of genes.  Almost 10 years after Fire and Mello received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of this mechanism in flat worms, RNA interference is on the edge of becoming a new class of therapeutics."
Isn't nintedanib effective for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?,no,"In this review, we present the positive results of recently published clinical trials regarding therapy for IPF, with emphasis on pirfenidone and nintedanib. Nintedanib: evidence for its therapeutic potential in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  In the Phase II TOMORROW trial, treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily showed a trend to slow the decline in lung function and significantly decrease acute exacerbations in patients with IPF, while showing an acceptable safety profile. The Phase III INPULSIS trials demonstrated a significant decrease in the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity in IPF patients treated with 150 mg nintedanib twice daily. In the INPULSIS-2 trial, the time to the first acute exacerbation significantly increased in IPF patients who were treated with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily.  Effects on collagen secretion were compared with those of the drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone, recently approved for IPF. Nintedanib, an orally available, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selectivity for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors has recently been shown, in two pivotal phase III studies, to effectively slow IPF disease progression. Consequently, nintedanib was given accelerated approval by the FDA in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  Most recently, pirfenidone and nintedanib, two compounds with pleiotropic anti-fibrotic properties, have been proven effective in reducing functional decline and disease progression in IPF.  Meningococcal group B vaccine (Trumenba) to prevent more types of invasive meningococcal disease; antihemophilic factor (recombinant), porcine sequence (Obizur) to treat bleeding from acquired hemophilia A; and pirfenidone (Esbriet) and nintedanib (Ofev) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  More importantly, the period ends with the publication of two groundbreaking studies that confirmed that two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, slowed disease progression, leading to a historic approval by the FDA.  Nintedanib (Ofev(®)) is an orally available, small, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and cancer. Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF. Nintedanib has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of IPF, and for the second-line treatment in combination with docetaxel of locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma tumour histology.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of nintedanib leading to this first approval for IPF. Efficacy and safety of nintedanib in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib: a novel therapeutic approach for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib is in clinical development as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Reducing lung function decline in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: potential of nintedanib. These results suggest that nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Findings from recently published placebo-controlled trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have established that pirfenidone and nintedanib prevent about 50% of the decline in forced vital capacity typically seen in this disease; future trials are therefore unlikely to use placebo as a control group for ethical reasons. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is in clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Data from the Phase II TOMORROW study suggested that nintedanib 150�mg twice daily had clinical benefits with an acceptable safety profile.METHODS: The INPULSIS� trials are replicate Phase III, randomized, double-blind, studies comparing the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150�mg twice daily with placebo in patients with IPF.  Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  The most frequent adverse event in the nintedanib groups was diarrhea, with rates of 61.5% and 18.6% in the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-1 and 63.2% and 18.3% in the two groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-2. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nintedanib reduced the decline in FVC, which is consistent with a slowing of disease progression; nintedanib was frequently associated with diarrhea, which led to discontinuation of the study medication in less than 5% of patients.  A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We conducted two replicate 52-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials (INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily as compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Could bioprinting be used in regenerative medicine against bone disease?,yes,"Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves in the craniomaxillofacial complex), and complex organs with intricate 3D microarchitecture (e.g. liver, lymphoid organs), several technological limitations must be addressed.  It is expected that these new findings will give an innovation boost for the development of scaffolds for bone repair and reconstruction, which began with the use of bioinert materials, followed by bioactive materials and now leading to functional regenerative tissue units. These new developments have become possible with the discovery of the morphogenic activity of bioinorganic polymers, biocalcit, bio-polyphosphate and biosilica that are formed by a biogenic, enzymatic mechanism, a driving force along with the development of novel rapid-prototyping three-dimensional (3D) printing methods and bioprinting (3D cell printing) techniques that may allow a fabrication of customized implants for patients suffering in bone diseases in the future.

Isn't avanafil indicated for treatment of erectile dysfunction?,no,"CONTEXT: Avanafil (AVA) is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, but is reported for its poor aqueous solubility.  BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil and the recently approved avanafil represent the first-line choice for both on-demand and chronic treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED).  A survey on the experience of 136 Italian urologists in the treatment of erectile dysfunction with PDE5 inhibitors and recommendations for the use of Avanafil in the clinical practice. Efficacy of Avanafil 15 Minutes after Dosing in Men with Erectile Dysfunction: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Study. PURPOSE: We examined the therapeutic effects of avanafil 15 minutes after dosing in men with mild to severe erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil and avanafil are FDA approved drugs in market as PDE5 inhibitors for treating erectile dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Avanafil along with the other PDE5Is has shown to be a safe and effective oral treatment for ED, with avanafil's possible place in therapy for patients who want an on-demand option or as an alternative in patients who experience visual disturbances with the other agents. Avanafil (STENDRA™, SPEDRA™, Zepeeed™) is an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial in patients with erectile dysfunction, avanafil 50, 100 and 200 mg recipients had significantly greater improvements from baseline than placebo recipients in mean international index of erectile dysfunction-erectile function domain scores and in successful vaginal penetration and sexual intercourse attempts (coprimary endpoints).

Avanafil, a potent and highly selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction. Avanafil, a highly selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction, shows good safety profiles for retinal function and hemodynamics in anesthetized dogs. Cumulative data suggest that avanafil has a promising pharmacological profile for erectile dysfunction. These findings suggest that intracavernosal administration of avanafil might be beneficial for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients with T2DM. An open-label, long-term evaluation of the safety, efficacy and tolerability of avanafil in male patients with mild to severe erectile dysfunction. The effect of intracavernosal avanafil, a newer phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, on neonatal type 2 diabetic rats with erectile dysfunction. A phase 3, placebo controlled study of the safety and efficacy of avanafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction after nerve sparing radical prostatectomy. Avanafil is a potent selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor newly developed for treating erectile dysfunction (ED). Adverse events most commonly reported with avanafil treatment were headache, nasopharyngitis, flushing, and sinus congestion.Avanafil was safe and effective for treating erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes and was effective as early as 15 minutes and more than 6 hours after dosing Avanafil (STENDRA™, SPEDRA™, Zepeeed™) is an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction Avanafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a median time to maximum plasma concentration of 30 to 45 min. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial in patients with erectile dysfunction, avanafil 50, 100 and 200 mg recipients had significantly greater improvements from baseline than placebo recipients in mean international index of erectile dysfunction-erectile function domain scores and in successful vaginal penetration and sexual intercourse attempts (coprimary endpoints) A phase II, single-blind, randomized, crossover evaluation of the safety and efficacy of avanafil using visual sexual stimulation in patients with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction To evaluate the safety, efficacy and time course of three doses of avanafil (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) compared with sildenafil 50 mg or placebo, given in conjunction with visual sexual stimulation (VSS) videos in men with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction (ED).Male patients, 35-70 years of age, with mild to moderate ED of ≥6 months duration, were included in the study Avanafil for erectile dysfunction To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of avanafil and evaluate relevant clinical trial data.A MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (1966 to July 2013) were conducted using the key words: avanafil, erectile dysfunction, and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.Articles evaluating avanafil for erectile dysfunction (ED) published in English and using human subjects were selected In trials in patients with erectile dysfunction in association with diabetes mellitus, and after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, avanafil 100 or 200 mg was significantly more efficacious than placebo for primary and most secondary endpoints However, the potentiating effect of avanafil at 1 mg/kg was significantly weaker than that of sildenafil (p &lt;0.05).Data suggest that avanafil has a favorable safety profile for erectile dysfunction, which is attributable to its high inhibitory selectivity for phosphodiesterase type 5 against type 6 (retina) and 1 (vessels, etc), respectively, and its short acting pharmacodynamic property.<CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2013 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

Is tretinoin effective for photoaging?,yes,"Background. Tretinoin has been shown to improve photoaged skin. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a 5% retinoic acid peel combined with microdermabrasion for facial photoaging. .Conclusion. This study demonstrated that 5% retinoic acid peel cream combined with microdermabrasion was safe and effective in the treatment of photoaging in the Iranian population.  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a double-conjugate retinoid cream demonstrated early reductions in photodamage and improvements in Hydration. AHA-Ret induced less Erythema vs retinol and was more tolerable vs retinol and tretinoin. These comparative products include prescription tretinoin, physician strength idebenone, kinetin, polyhydroxy, lactic and glycolic acids in reversing signs of photoaging. CONCLUSION: Either topical tretinoin (0.25%) or retinol (0.25%) can be used safely and effectively when applied in office immediately after SA peeling to ameliorate signs of photoaging. CONCLUSION: The treatment outcome of Retinol 0.2%/LR2412 2% cream does not differ from the one of tretinoin 0.025% cream. Clinical results were not statistically different.  INTRODUCTION: Topical tretinoin is considered the gold standard to treat photoaged skin, but it is associated with side effects and only available upon prescription. Tretinoin is commonly used topically for acne treatment and in the treatment of photoaging. BACKGROUND: Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. The efficacy of tretinoin is well established in the treatment of acne and photoaged skin, however as a typical side effect of tretinoin treatment most patients develop a low-grade irritant dermatitis. Topical tretinoin is established as an effective treatment for photoaging. BACKGROUND Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. Tretinoin is the only pharmacologic compound shown to partially reverse some signs of photoaging. Although once considered an irreversible process, it is now established that photoaging can be treated by topical tretinoin. Moreover, studies that have elucidated photoaging pathophysiology have produced significant evidence that topical tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid), the only agent approved so far for the treatment of photoaging, also works to prevent it. BACKGROUND AND DESIGN The efficacy of topical tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) in treating photoaging is well established. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS Tretinoin can be used for photoaging treatment or combined treatment by different mechanisms. Tretinoin is still the best tested retinoid to reverse photoaged skin. The separation between clinical improvement and irritation suggests that mechanisms other than irritation dominate tretinoin-induced repair of photoaging in humans. * A cream containing 0.05% tretinoin (Retinova((R)) is approved for treatment of sun-induced skin damage (""photoaging""). Randomized, controlled trials have shown that topical tretinoin is effective in the treatment of photoaged skin. Tretinoin has been shown to improve photoaged skin. Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that topical tretinoin is effective in the treatment of photoaged skin..

Does PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) binds with HDL-receptor (HDL-R)?,no,"Recently it was revealed that the secreted Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin 9 (PCSK9) binds with LDL-receptor (LDL-R) causing its degradation in the lysosome with the result of LDL-C accumulating in the blood. The major goal of this study is to identify peptide/s from the catalytic domain of hPCSK9 that can block the binding of hPCSK9 and LDL-R and therefore can reduce LDL-R degradation leading to the clearance of LDL-C from the plasma. In vitro administration of SRT3025 to cultured AML12 hepatocytes attenuated Pcsk9 secretion and its binding to Ldlr, thereby reducing Pcsk9-mediated Ldlr degradation and increasing Ldlr expression and LDL uptake. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which involves in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism by interacting with the LDL receptor, is considered as a potent therapeutic target for treating hypercholesterolemia.  Taken together, these results suggested that the IgG1-PA4 can be served as a potential candidate for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting PCSK9-mediated degradation of cell surface LDLRs. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, escorting it to its destruction in the lysosome and thereby preventing the recirculation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor to the hepatocyte cell surface.  However, statins have low efficiency because they also increase PCSK9 which targets LDLR for degradation. Inhibition of the enzyme PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), which is involved in depletion of the LDL-receptor, is a new pharmacologic approach.  Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) modulates LDL-c through post-translational degradation of the LDLR. Mechanistically, hepatic S1P KD was shown to decrease the liver and plasma levels of the protein proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which degrades LDLR protein.  We report here the development of sdAbs targeting human PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) as an alternative to anti-PCSK9 mAbs. PCSK9 proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK9) protein plays an important role in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism, due to its role in the degradation of the LDL receptor. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptors, leading to their degradation Low density lipoprotein binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) in human plasma and inhibits PCSK9-mediated low density lipoprotein receptor degradation Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like-A domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and mediates LDLR degradation in liver Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds LDL receptors, targeting them for degradation Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which binds the low-density lipoprotein receptor and targets it for degradation, has emerged as an important regulator of serum cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease risk Secreted proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) at the cell surface and disrupts the normal recycling of the LDLR Proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key regulator of plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) and cardiovascular risk, is produced in liver and secreted into plasma where it binds hepatic LDL receptors (LDLR), leading to their degradation Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and is therefore a prominent therapeutic target for reducing LDL-cholesterol In the present study we scanned the related gene of a clinically diagnosed autosomal genetic hypercholesterolemia family for the possible mutations and established eukaryotic expression vector of mutation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene with gene recombination technique to investigate the contributions of the variation on low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) metabolism and function alternation.Mutation detection was conducted for LDL-R, apolipoprotein B(100) (apoB(100)) and PCSK9 gene with nucleotide sequencing in a Chinese FH family Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) provides a key step in LDL metabolism by stimulating LDL receptor degradation. The proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) pathway plays a key role in lipoprotein metabolism by promoting LDL-receptor degradation. Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a key role in LDL receptor processing. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLr) in hepatocytes, and its expression in mouse liver has been shown to decrease with fenofibrate treatment.We developed a sandwich ELISA using recombinant human PCSK9 protein and 2 affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against human PCSK9. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enhances the degradation of the LDLR and modulates liver CD81 levels. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism is governed by proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which down-regulates LDL receptor expression, resulting in higher LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is gaining attention as a key regulator of serum LDL-cholesterol (LDLC). The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene regulates cholesterol homoeostasis by accelerating low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation resulting in the decreased catabolism of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leading to hypercholesterolaemia. Low density lipoprotein binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) in human plasma and inhibits PCSK9-mediated low density lipoprotein receptor degradation. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like-A domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and mediates LDLR degradation in liver. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a regulator of LDL-cholesterol receptor homeostasis and emerges as a therapeutic target in the prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease. The present study was conducted to investigate the role of plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels, a regulator of LDL-receptor expression, in the occurrence of diabetic dyslipidemia."
Can't the iPS cell technology be used in Fanconi anemia therapy?,no,"We explain a protocol for the reproducible generation of genetically corrected iPSCs starting from the skin biopsies of Fanconi anemia patients using retroviral transduction with OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4 Before reprogramming, the fibroblasts and/or keratinocytes of the patients are genetically corrected with lentiviruses expressing FANCA. Disease-corrected haematopoietic progenitors from Fanconi anaemia induced pluripotent stem cells Here we show that, on correction of the genetic defect, somatic cells from Fanconi anaemia patients can be reprogrammed to pluripotency to generate patient-specific iPS cells. These cell lines appear indistinguishable from human embryonic stem cells and iPS cells from healthy individuals Most importantly, we show that corrected Fanconi-anaemia-specific iPS cells can give rise to haematopoietic progenitors of the myeloid and erythroid lineages that are phenotypically normal, that is, disease-free"
Isn't there an increase in ultrasound comets after intense exercise?,no,"Healthy athletes developed subclinical increase in pulmonary water content immediately after an Ironman race at sea level, as shown by the increased number of ULCs related to cardiac changes occurring during exercise. Increased EVLW is associated with estimated PCWP and indices of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The additional exercise-induced increase of PCWP, the worsening of left ventricular diastolic function, and extensive wall-motion abnormalities correlate with variations of EVLW.  Among them chest ultrasonography can detect and quantify the extravascular lung water, creating ""comet-tail"" ultrasound artefacts (ULCs) from water-thickened pulmonary interlobular septa.  In top-level breath-hold divers, chest sonography frequently reveals an increased number of ULCs after immersion, indicating a relatively high prevalence of (often subclinical) reversible extravascular lung water accumulation."
Isn't calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,no,"High-glucose treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria. Concomitant intra-mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]m) increase resulted in enhanced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation. These events led to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. The novel findings of the study reveal that high glucose induces apoptosis by both mitochondria-dependent and independent pathways via concomitant rise in intracellular calcium. Diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunction has been attributed, in part, to calcium overload within individual myocytes. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy; BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that intracellular Ca2+ overload in cardiac myocytes leads to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The results from the alloxan-rat model of diabetes support the view that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. It has been suggested that the occurrence of an intracellular Ca2+ overload may result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction."
Doesn't ventriculoperitoneal shunt improve normal pressure hydrocephalus?,no,"Clinical improvement depends not only on the capability to restore the cerebrospinal fluid dynamic, but also on the ability of cerebral parenchyma to recover the metabolic function.  After shunting, the global CMRglu significantly increased (2.95 ± 0.44 vs 4.38 ± 0.68, p = 10(-7)) in all INPH patients with a mean percentage value of 48.7%.  Our preliminary data show that changes in the CMRglu are promptly reversible after surgery and that there is a relationship between the early metabolic changes and clinical symptoms, independently from the simultaneous changes in the ventricular size. The remarkable and prompt improvement in the global CMRglu and in symptoms may also have important implications for the current concept of ""neuronal plasticity"" and for the cells' reactivity in order to recover their metabolic function. Outcome of shunting in INPH is most often successful when patients are accurately diagnosed, suitably evaluated for surgical candidacy, and managed carefully throughout the preoperative, surgical, and postoperative periods. The decision to perform the only efficient procedure, i.e., a ventricular shunt operation, depends upon a number of established arguments in favor of that procedure. Clinical improvement, which is often spectacular, can then confirm the diagnosis.  During the 1st postoperative year, there was improvement in the condition of 22 patients (96%) who had received a ventricular shunt; 21 of these patients (91%) remained improved until death or for at least 5 years. Shunt treatment showed an effect on cognitive functions of distractibility of attention and motor speed, but not on intelligence of memory. Three patients deteriorated, eleven remained stable and sixteen showed significant improvement on psychological tests, mainly those for attention, motor speed and memory, but rarely did any improvement of intelligence occur."
Is sumoylation implicated in myogenesis?,yes,"Sentrin/small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 2 (SENP2) has broad de-SUMOylation activities in vitro, which is essential for embryonic heart development. Silencing SENP2 can reduce myostatin expression and, therefore, promote myogenesis of skeletal muscle. These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. Overexpression of c-Ski/SnoN also induces skeletal muscle differentiation, but how c-Ski/SnoN function in myogenesis is largely unknown. Notably, loss of sumoylation in the Lys-50 site (via a Lys-to-Arg point mutation) potently activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhances myotube formation. Our study suggests a novel role for SUMO modification in the regulation of myogenic differentiation. Although this modification has little effect on SnoN repression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and only modestly potentiates SnoN repression of the p21 promoter, SnoN sumoylation robustly augments the ability of SnoN to suppress transcription of the myogenesis master regulatory gene myogenin Our study also points to a physiological role for SnoN sumoylation in the control of myogenin expression in differentiating muscle cells. Here, we biochemically characterize SnoN sumoylation in detail and report the physiological function of the modification.  An essential role of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific Protease 2 in myostatin expression and myogenesis. These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. The E3 SUMO ligase Nse2 regulates sumoylation and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of skNAC-Smyd1 in myogenesis. Sumoylation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor sharp-1 regulates recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a and function in myogenesis.  We show that the overall load of sumoylated proteins present in myoblasts diminishes progressively throughout myogenesis These novel results suggest that protein sumoylation plays a pivotal role in myoblast differentiation and is required to regulate the activity of key targets downstream of MyoD and myogenin. a composite sequence motif has recently been identified that couples phosphorylation, sumoylation, and perhaps also deacetylation to control transcriptional repression in stress response, mitogen and nuclear hormone signaling, myogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. Mutation of these SUMO acceptor sites in Sharp-1 does not impact its subcellular localization but attenuates its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit myogenic differentiation. Consistently, co-expression of the SUMO protease SENP1 with wild type Sharp-1 abrogates Sharp-1-dependent inhibition of myogenesis.  Transforming growth factor-beta-independent regulation of myogenesis by SnoN sumoylation. Ubiquitin Specific Protease 25 (USP25), a member of the deubiquitinase family, is involved in several disease-related signal pathways including myogenesis, immunity and protein degradation.   In addition, we show that the skNAC interaction partner Smyd1 contains a putative sumoylation motif and is sumoylated in muscle cells, with depletion of Mms21/Nse2 leading to reduced concentrations of sumoylated Smyd1. Taken together, our data suggest that the function, specifically the balance between the nuclear and cytosolic roles, of the skNAC-Smyd1 complex might be regulated by sumoylation."
Doesn't NADPH oxidase 5 require any subunit for function?,yes,"Nox5 forms a functional oligomer mediated by self-association of its dehydrogenase domain.  While Nox1-4 require regulatory subunits, including p22phox, Nox5 activity does not depend on any subunits.   Thus, Nox5 forms a catalytically active oligomer in the membrane that is mediated by its dehydrogenase domain.  Coexpression of specific Nox catalytic subunits (Nox1, Nox2, Nox3, Nox4, or Nox5) along with their corresponding regulatory subunits (NOXO1/NOXA1 for Nox1; p47phox/p67phox/Rac for Nox2; NOXO1 for Nox3; no subunits for Nox4 or Nox5) resulted in marked production of reactive oxygen."
Isn't there an association between borna virus and brain tumor?,yes,"Borna disease virus (BDV), a nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus, infects a wide variety of mammalian species and readily establishes a long-lasting, persistent infection in brain cells.  To investigate the biological characteristics of field isolates of Borna disease virus (BDV), as well as to understand BDV infections outside endemic countries, we isolated the virus from brain samples of a heifer with Borna disease in Japan. Neonatal Borna disease virus (BDV) infection of the rat brain is associated with microglial activation and damage to the certain neuronal populations. In addition, compared to uninfected mixed cultures, activation of microglia in BDV-infected mixed cultures was associated with a significantly greater lipopolysaccharide-induced release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 10. Taken together, the present data are the first in vitro evidence that persistent BDV infection of neurons and astrocytes rather than direct exposure to the virus or dying neurons is critical for activating microglia. Usually, Borna disease virus is not cleared from the brain but rather persists in neural cells. Varied persistent life cycles of Borna disease virus in a human oligodendroglioma cell line. Borna disease virus (BDV) establishes a persistent infection in the central nervous system of vertebrate animal species as well as in tissue cultures.  Thus, our findings show that BDV may have established a persistent infection at low levels of viral expression in OL cells with the possibility of a latent infection. These results suggested that BDV infection may cause direct damage in the developing brain by inhibiting the function of amphoterin due to binding by the p24 phosphoprotein. We describe a model for investigating disorders of central nervous system development based on neonatal rat infection with Borna disease virus, a neurotropic noncytolytic RNA virus.  Borna disease virus (BDV) replicates in brain cells. The neonatally infected rat with BDV exhibits developmental-neuromorphological abnormalities, neuronal cytolysis, and multiple behavioral and physiological alterations.  Borna disease virus (BDV) causes central nervous system (CNS) disease in several vertebrate species, which is frequently accompanied by behavioral abnormalities. Intrinsic responses to Borna disease virus infection of the central nervous system. Immune cells invading the central nervous system (CNS) in response to Borna disease virus (BDV) antigens are central to the pathogenesis of Borna disease (BD).  We report here the partial purification and characterization of cell-free BDV from the tissue culture supernatant of infected human neuroblastoma SKNSH cells. We have used the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique to gain insight into the pathogenesis of encephalitis caused by Borna disease virus (BDV).  In contrast, in the BDV-infected primary mixed cultures, we observed proliferation of microglia cells that acquired the round morphology and expressed major histocompatibility complex molecules of classes I and II."
Isn't intraoperative radiotherapy used for treatment of glioblastoma?,yes,"1) Intraoperative radiotherapy ( IOR , 1,000-2,000 rad) was applied in 13 cases; the 2-year survival was 41.6%.  The median survival time after IORT was 12 months for 9 patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, while it was 51 months for 8 patients with less infiltrative tumors (ependymoma, anaplastic ependymoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma).  It is concluded that IORT combined with extensive tumor removal has an acceptable toxicity in previously irradiated patients and can be effective for selected recurrent malignant brain tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that IORT can contribute to successful tumor treatment while neither increasing peri-operative morbidity nor subacute sequelae. This review compiles preclinical and clinical evidence for a dedicated treatment of both residual cancer cells and regional microenvironment using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT).  Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a pragmatic and effective approach to sterilize the margins from persistent tumor cells, abrogate post-injury proliferative stimuli and to bridge the therapeutic gap between surgery and radiochemotherapy.

Is lenvatinib effective for thyroid cancer?,yes,"New insights in the treatment of radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid carcinomas: to lenvatinib and beyond. However, even more impressive responses and progression-free survival benefits were seen in the phase III SELECT trial with lenvatinib, giving even higher hopes for the future management of what was considered just a decade ago an orphan disease.  Sorafenib and lenvatinib, small-molecule multikinase inhibitors, were approved for the treatment of progressive, symptomatic, radioactive iodine refractory, advanced differentiated thyroid cancer in 2013 and 2015, respectively. A phase 2 trial of lenvatinib (E7080) in advanced, progressive, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer: A clinical outcomes and biomarker assessment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with and without prior exposure to VEGF therapy, the encouraging response rates, median time to response, and PFS for lenvatinib have prompted further investigation in a phase 3 trial.  Since 2011, four multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for thyroid cancer - cabozantinib and vandetanib for medullary thyroid cancer and sorafenib and lenvatinib for differentiated thyroid cancer.  Moreover, four of those investigational drugs, vandetanib, cabozantinib, sorafenib and lenvatinib, have reached a phase III clinical trial with favorable results in progression-free survival and overall survival in medullary thyroid carcinoma and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Since 2011, four multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for thyroid cancer - cabozantinib and vandetanib for medullary thyroid cancer and sorafenib and lenvatinib for differentiated thyroid cancer BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor �, RET, and KIT, showed clinical activity in a phase 2 study involving patients with differentiated thyroid cancer that was refractory to radioiodine (iodine-131).METHODS: In our phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study involving patients with progressive thyroid cancer that was refractory to iodine-131, we randomly assigned 261 patients to receive lenvatinib (at a daily dose of 24 mg per day in 28-day cycles) and 131 patients to receive placebo.  Positive phase 1 results in solid tumors prompted a phase 2 trial in patients with advanced, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC).METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with RR-DTC who had disease progression during the previous 12 months received lenvatinib 24 mg once daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal, or death."
Is infertility characteristic of individuals with Fanconi anemia?,yes,"PALB2 links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in homologous recombinational repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Mono-allelic mutations in PALB2 increase the risk of breast, pancreatic, and other cancers, and biallelic mutations cause Fanconi anemia (FA).  Moreover, mutant males showed reduced fertility due to impaired meiosis and increased apoptosis in germ cells. Interestingly, mutant meiocytes showed a significant defect in sex chromosome synapsis, which likely contributed to the germ cell loss and fertility defect. In females with Fanconi anemia (FA), infertility is often accompanied by diminished ovarian reserve and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea before the age of 30 years, suggesting primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Substantially reduced AMH levels in females with FA suggest a primary ovarian defect associated with reduced fertility. Measurement of AMH at the time of FA diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of AMH levels at regular intervals may be useful for the timely management of complications related to POI such as subfertility/infertility, osteoporosis, and menopausal symptoms. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility.  Reduced fertility is one clinical manifestation among other well known Fanconi anemia features.  Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility Targeted disruption of exons 1 to 6 of the Fanconi Anemia group A gene leads to growth retardation, strain-specific microphthalmia, meiotic defects and primordial germ cell hypoplasia. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility. To potentially reduce late effects of malignancy, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), endocrinopathy, and infertility in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) undergoing HLA-matched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we developed a regimen using fludarabine (FLU), cyclophosphamide (CY), and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) followed by infusion of T-cell depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) or unmanipulated umbilical cord blood (UCB). Mutations in Fanca account for the majority of cases of Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessively inherited disease identified by congenital defects, bone marrow failure, infertility, and cancer susceptibility. FANCA is mutated in more than 60% of cases of Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, endocrine tissue cancer susceptibility, and infertility. In females with Fanconi anemia (FA), infertility is often accompanied by diminished ovarian reserve and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea before the age of 30 years, suggesting primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Fanconi anemia (FA) is a complex cancer susceptibility disorder associated with DNA repair defects and infertility, yet the precise function of the FA proteins in genome maintenance remains unclear. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease resulting in bone marrow failure, high cancer risks, and infertility, and developmental anomalies including microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypoplastic radius and thumb."
Is zyxin a focal adhesion protein?,yes,"zyxin from FAs zyxin relocation from focal adhesions  . Here we systematically examined the expression, localization, and function of zyxin, a focal adhesion protein focal adhesion protein zyxin Focal adhesions formed in the absence of α-actinins are delayed in their maturation, exhibit altered morphology, have decreased amounts of Zyxin and VASP, and reduced adhesiveness to extracellular matrix one focal adhesion protein (zyxin) Zyxin is a focal adhesion protein that has been implicated in the modulation of cell adhesion and motility  focal adhesion proteins (vinculin, talin, zyxin, FAK, and paxilin) Such paxillin-positive complexes mature into focal adhesions by tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of zyxin.  Zyxin concentrates at focal adhesions  zyxin, a focal adhesion protein, Focal adhesion proteins Zyxin and Vinculin are co-distributed at tubulobulbar complexes.

Does TFIIS affect nucleosome positioning?,yes,"Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome.  The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT The system contains natural or recombinant histones, chromatin assembly factors, the histone-acetyltransferase p300, all components of the general transcription machinery, general coactivators and the elongation factor SII (TFIIS). Efficient and rapid nucleosome traversal by RNA polymerase II depends on a combination of transcript elongation factors. We now show that although TFIIF or TFIIS alone is modestly stimulatory for nucleosome traversal, both factors together increase transcription through nucleosomes in a synergistic manner. Significantly, we found that nucleosomes with a Sin mutant histone are traversed to the same extent and at nearly the same rate as equivalent pure DNA templates if both TFIIS and TFIIF are present. After partial uncoiling of nucleosomal DNA from histone octamer by Pol II and backtracking of the enzyme, nucleosomal DNA recoils on the octamer, locking Pol II in the arrested state. Histone chaperones and transcription factors TFIIS, TFIIF and FACT facilitate transcription through chromatin using different molecular mechanisms. Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome. The highly conserved eukaryotic transcriptional elongation factor TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to read though pause or termination sites, nucleosomes and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. We also studied the effect of TFIIF and TFIIS on transcription of nucleosomes containing a Sin mutant histone. The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT."
Do mutations of AKT1 occur in meningiomas?,yes,"The recent identification of somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningiomas. A mutation in PIK3CA or AKT1 was found in around 9 % of the cases. AKT1E17K mutations cluster with meningothelial and transitional meningiomas and can be detected by SFRP1 immunohistochemistry. AKT1E17K mutations were exclusively seen in meningiomas and occurred in 65 of 958 of these tumors. A strong preponderance was seen in the variant of meningothelial meningioma WHO grade I of basal and spinal localization. In contrast, AKT1E17K mutations were rare in WHO grade II and absent in WHO grade III meningiomas.  We observed strong up-regulation of SFRP1 expression in all meningiomas with AKT1E17K mutation and in HEK293 cells after transfection with mutant AKT1E17K, but not in meningiomas and HEK293 cells lacking this mutation. SMO and AKT1 mutations occur in non-NF2 meningiomas. Recurrent mutations in SMO and AKT1 are mutually exclusive with NF2 loss in meningioma. Genomic sequencing of meningiomas identifies oncogenic SMO and AKT1 mutations.  A subset of meningiomas lacking NF2 alterations harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 (p.Glu17Lys) and SMO (p.Trp535Leu) and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of activation of these pathways. Genomic analysis of non-NF2 meningiomas reveals mutations in TRAF7, KLF4, AKT1, and SMO.

Doesn't Jarid2 play a role in early embryo development?,no,"Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development Unlike other PRC2-deficient embryonic stem cells (ESCs), however, Jarid2-deficient ESCs show a severe differentiation block, altered colony morphology, and distinctive patterns of deregulated gene expression. Here, we show that Jarid2(-/-) ESCs express constitutively high levels of Nanog but reduced PCP signaling components Wnt9a, Prickle1, and Fzd2 and lowered β-catenin activity. Depletion of Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 from wild-type ESCs or overexpression of Nanog largely phenocopies these cellular defects. Co-culture of Jarid2(-/-) with wild-type ESCs restores variable Nanog expression and β-catenin activity and can partially rescue the differentiation block of mutant cells. In addition, we show that ESCs lacking Jarid2 or Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 or overexpressing Nanog induce multiple ICM formation when injected into normal E3.5 blastocysts. These data describe a previously unrecognized role for Jarid2 in regulating a core pluripotency and Wnt/PCP signaling circuit that is important for ESC differentiation and for pre-implantation development. Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development. Consistent with an essential role for PcG proteins in early development, we demonstrate that JARID2 is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Jumonij (JMJ)/Jarid2 plays important roles in embryonic development and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Thus, these results demonstrate that JARID2 is essential for the binding of PcG proteins to target genes and, consistent with this, for the proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells and normal development. JARID2 is an accessory component of Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) required for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

Are reduced-nicotine cigarettes effective for smoking cessation?,yes,"CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-week study, reduced-nicotine cigarettes versus standard-nicotine cigarettes reduced nicotine exposure and dependence and the number of cigarettes smoked.  RESULTS: Significant reductions in nicotine intake were observed between usual brand smoking (∼1.2 mg nicotine) and the 0.3 and 0.05 mg nicotine emission cigarettes, but not the 0.6 mg cigarette. CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the evidence that cigarettes with markedly reduced nicotine content are not associated with increased smoking intensity or exposure to smoke toxicants. BACKGROUND: When switching from usual brand cigarettes, very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, toxicant exposure, withdrawal symptoms and dependence.  Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake. Results showed that Quest plus NRT was more effective than active control plus NRT in achieving 4 weeks of continuous abstinence (32.8% vs. 21.9%). Quest plus NRT offers promise as a new smoking cessation treatment. We identified three clinical trials (total n = 489) that suggest that smokers can dissociate nicotine delivery from the act of smoking if they use reduced-nicotine content cigarettes in combination with nicotine replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: The 0.05 mg nicotine yield cigarettes may be a tobacco product that can facilitate cessation; however, future research is clearly needed to support these preliminary findings. Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment. Reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation. Evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates. The concept for a reduced-nicotine cigarette designed to progressively wean smokers from the smoking habit is based on research demonstrating that successful smoking cessation is not only dependent on withdrawal of nicotine, but also on weaning from the habitual sensory and behavioral reinforcement of smoking. Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment Specifically, standards that required substantially reduced nicotine content in cigarettes could enable cessation in smokers and prevent future smoking among current non-smokers Reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation Evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates The concept for a reduced-nicotine cigarette designed to progressively wean smokers from the smoking habit is based on research demonstrating that successful smoking cessation is not only dependent on withdrawal of nicotine, but also on weaning from the habitual sensory and behavioral reinforcement of smoking These results suggest that use of NRT before a target quit-smoking date deserves further evaluation as a possible smoking cessation treatment. Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake. Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment."
Is NEMO a zinc finger protein?,yes,"To better understand the thermodynamics and dynamics of the zinc finger of NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) an alteration in the zinc finger domain of NEMO (K392R)  CYLD and the NEMO Zinc Finger Regulate Tumor Necrosis Factor Signaling and Early Embryogenesis. our simulations of the zinc finger NEMO An important regulatory domain of NF-[Formula: see text]B Essential Modulator (NEMO) is a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger, with a tetrahedral CYS3HIS1 zinc-coordinating binding site.

We show here that the NEMO C terminus, comprising the ubiquitin binding region and a zinc finger,"
Doesn't magnesium sulfate improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,yes,"CONCLUSION: Patients assigned a higher serum magnesium concentration had a reduced incidence of vasospasm as seen by angiography, but the difference was not statistically significant. Clinically significant outcomes were not different between groups. 158 patients (26·2%) had poor outcome in the magnesium group compared with 151 (25·3%) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1·03, 95% CI 0·85-1·25). Our updated meta-analysis of seven randomised trials involving 2047 patients shows that magnesium is not superior to placebo for reduction of poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (RR 0·96, 95% CI 0·86-1·08). INTERPRETATION: Intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.  There is a tendency in the magnesium group to have better outcomes.  Due to inconsistently reported benefits and the occurrence of side effects, phase II data suggested that intravenous magnesium for SAH provided either no overall net benefit or uncertain trade-offs. Benefit was likewise not supported in the single phase III clinical trial. tatistically significant clinical benefits could not be demonstrated for the other drugs (clazosentan, statins, and magnesium). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence is available to support the use of the triple-H therapy, clazosentan, statins, or magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Magnesium sulfate decreased the rate of cerebral infarction, but not of DCI or poor functional outcome. Regarding outcome, a beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate on outcome can not be ruled out because of sample size limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings do not lend support to a beneficial effect of magnesium sulphate infusion on delayed cerebral infarction. The reduction in DCI and improvement in the clinical outcomes of aneurysmal SAH patients following magnesium sulphate infusion observed in previous pilot studies are not confirmed, although a beneficial effect cannot be ruled out because of sample size limitation. Favorable outcome (Good recovery and moderate disability, as defined by Glasgow Outcome Scale) was achieved in 20 of 30 (67%) patients receiving magnesium sulfate infusion and 16 of 30 (53%) patients receiving placebo treatment, p = 0.292, odds ratio 1.750, 95% CI 0.616-4.974. Similarly, the pooled odds ratio for favorable outcome is 1.598, 95% CI 1.074-2.377, statistically significant.  RESULTS: The worst clinical outcomes at 6 months were seen in MgSO(4) group patients, with mean plasma magnesium concentrations in the fourth quartile, and in placebo group patients, with mean such concentrations in the third and fourth quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to suggest that a higher mean plasma magnesium concentration improves clinical outcomes. On the contrary, we found an association between high plasma magnesium concentration and worse clinical outcomes. The proportions of patients with a favorable outcome at 6 months (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 to 8) were similar, 64% in the magnesium sulfate group and 63% in the saline group (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6). Secondary outcome analyses (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form 36, and clinical vasospasm) also showed no significant differences between the 2 groups.  CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support a clinical benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion over placebo infusion in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnesium infusion reduced the risk of poor outcome and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI): the relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-1.00), respectively.  CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests that intravenous magnesium therapy reduces the risk of DCI and poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH.  The incidence of delayed ischemic infarction was significantly lower in magnesium-treated patients (22% vs. 51%; p = .002); 34 of 54 magnesium patients and 27 of 53 control patients reached good outcome (p = .209). BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit.  These data imply that intravenous magnesium therapy, besides a supposed beneficial effect on outcome, also provides pain relief for SAH patients, for whom it might also improve functional outcome. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  In a phase II randomized clinical trial of 283 patients, magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% and of poor outcome by 23%. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that high-dose MgSO4 therapy is safe and reduces the incidence of DIND and subsequent poor outcome after SAH.  On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after 3 months (P = .017) and a trend toward better outcome after 1 year (P = .083).   CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MgSO4 therapy might be efficient as a prophylactic adjacent therapy after SAH to reduce the risk for poor outcome.  There was no significant difference in mortality rate at discharge (p = 0.328). A trend toward improved outcome as measured by the modifed Rankin Scale (p = 0.084), but not the Glasgow Outcome Scale (p = 1.0), was seen in the MgSO4 treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results suggests that MgSO4 infusion may have a role in cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis if therapy is initiated within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture. There was, however, no difference between groups in functional recovery or Glasgow Outcome Scale score.  Patients receiving MgSO4 tended to have fewer neurological deficits, better functional recovery and an improved score in GOS.  CONCLUSIONS: MgSO4 infusion after aneurysmal SAH is well tolerated and may be useful in producing better outcome. CONCLUSION: Magnesium did not seem to interfere in vasospasm frequency but apparently acted favorably in decreasing morbidity and length of hospital stay. None of the patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients). At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive.  We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level.  Magnesium sulfate treatment improves outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a meta-analysis study. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our results indicate that although there was reduced likelihood of a poor outcome for patients treated with magnesium sulfate after SAH, patient mortality was not improved. CONCLUSION: Administration of intra-arterial magnesium sulfate in combination with nicardipine was well tolerated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm without a significant change in MAP and ICP. Current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit Despite the publication of several randomized controlled studies, there is still much debate on whether magnesium sulfate improves outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Magnesium sulphate is a neuroprotective agent that might improve outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage by reducing the occurrence or improving the outcome of delayed cerebral ischaemia"
Is signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) critical for tumor angiogenesis progression?,yes,"(STAT3) is critical for cancer progression by regulating tumor cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Herein, we investigated the regulation of STAT3 activation and the therapeutic effects of Icaritin, a prenyl flavonoid derivative from Epimedium Genus, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).   Overall, these results suggest that Icaritin strongly inhibits STAT3 activation and is a potentially effective therapeutic option for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma we have reviewed important signaling pathways that are closely related to radiosensitization, such as cell cycle arrest, tumor angiogenesis, JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and Mismatch repair Interleukin-27 signaling is mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway via activation of STAT1 and STAT3, which have tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities, respectively. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis are key processes in carcinogenesis. The inhibition of STAT3 activation had no effect on the development of the epithelial phenotype. STAT3 plays a vital role in inducing and maintaining a pro-carcinogenic inflammatory microenvironment and is reported to be a critical mediator of the oncogenic effects of EGFR mutations. STAT3 activation is mediated through JAK family kinases  EESB treatment could significantly suppress the activation of several CRC-related pathways, including STAT3, Erk, and p38 signalings in tumor tissues, and alter the expression of multiple critical target genes such as Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1, CDK4, and p21. These molecular effects lead to the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that SB possesses a broad range of antitumor activities because of its ability to affect multiple intracellular targets Western immunoblotting analyses of mouse lung tissues indicated significantly lower level of pSTAT3 and Mcl-1 in the carcinogen plus DMAPT group relative to the group treated with the carcinogen only. Given the evidence that STAT3 is activated in more than half of lung cancers and it regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, DMAPT is a promising agent for lung cancer chemoprevention in subjects who are at high risk of developing this devastating disease. (STAT3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. It is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at position 705 leading to its dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and activation of gene transcription. Under normal physiological conditions, STAT3 activation is tightly regulated. However, compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis. It regulates cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis that are critical for cancer metastasis STAT3) signaling pathway plays important roles in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, immunity, and tumor cell invasion. In the present study, we investigated the association of interleukin   Phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) regulates many genes that are necessarily expressed in cancer initiation, development, and progression, being involved in proliferation, anti-apoptosis, invasion, angiogenesis, and immune surveillance evasion"
Isn't Rac1 involved in cancer cell invasion?,no,"In the Matrigel invasion assay, knockdown of CCR1 and inhibition of the ERK and Rac signaling pathways significantly decreased the number of invading cells. These results demonstrated for the first time that the interaction of CCR1 with CCL5 caused by increased expression of CCR1 promotes invasion of PC3PR cells by increasing secretion of MMPs 2 and 9 and by activating ERK and Rac signaling. These data suggest that P-Rex1 has an influence on physiological migratory processes, such as invasion of cancer cells, both through effects upon classical Rac1-driven motility and a novel association with RTK signalling complexes. Activated PAR1 induced RhoA and Rac1 phosphorylation, and subsequent overexpression of myosin IIA and filamin B which are stress fiber components that were identified by PMF analysis of peptide mass data obtained by MALDI-TOF/MS measurement.  These results demonstrate that PAR1 activation induces cell morphological change associated with cell motility via Rho family activation and cytoskeletal protein overexpression, and has a critical role in gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Rac1 was found to be required for actopaxin-induced matrix degradation whereas inhibition of myosin contractility promoted degradation in the phosphomutant-expressing Quint cells, indicating that a balance of Rho GTPase signaling and regulation of cellular tension are important for the process. Taken together, this study demonstrates a new role for actopaxin phosphorylation in matrix degradation and cell invasion via regulation of Rho GTPase signaling. BART inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion by Rac1 inactivation through direct binding to active Rac1 We report that Binder of Arl Two (BART) plays a role in inhibiting cell invasion by regulating the activity of the Rho small guanosine triphosphatase protein Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells. BART interacts with active forms of Rac1, and the BART-Rac1 complex localizes at the leading edges of migrating cancer cells. Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells in which BART is stably knocked down with a Rac1 inhibitor decreases invasiveness. Thus, BART-dependent inhibition of cell invasion is likely associated with decreased active Rac1. The Rac1 inhibitor inhibits the lamellipodia formation that is stimulated by suppression of BART. Our results imply that BART regulates actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements at membrane ruffles through modulation of the activity of Rac1, which, in turn, inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion. It has been reported as an important inducer of cancer cell migration and invasion, with underlying molecular mechanisms involving the signalling mediated by its juxtamembrane domain, the secretion of matrix metalloproteases to the extracellular media, and the cleavage of a P-cadherin soluble form with pro-invasive activity. Intracellularly, this protein interferes with the endogenous cadherin/catenin complex, inducing p120-catenin delocalization to the cytoplasm, and the consequent activation of Rac1/Cdc42 and associated alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. Targeted down-regulation of RhoC led to sustained activation of Rac1 GTPase and morphological, molecular and phenotypic changes reminiscent of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. We also find that Rac1 GTPase mediates tight binding of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells and promotes retraction of endothelial cells required for tumor cell diapedesis. Finally, Rac1 leads to β1 integrin activation, suggesting a mechanism that Rac1 can mediate tight binding with endothelial cells. Together, our data suggest that Rac1 GTPase is key mediator of prostate cancer cell-bone marrow endothelial cell interactions. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Rac1 (T17N) could largely block EGF-induced PI3K/Akt-PAK1 activation and cell migration. Our study demonstrated that EGF-induced cell migration involves a cascade of signalling events, including activation of Rac1, generation of ROS and subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and PAK1. Small GTPase proteins, including RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, and cdc42, are important molecules for linking cell shape and cell-cycle progression because of their role in both cytoskeletal arrangements and mitogenic signaling. The suppression of MMP-2 expression by CTXG led to an inhibition of SW620 cells invasion and migration by inactivating Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA GTPase. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that CTXG exerted anti-invasion action in SW620 cells by targeting MMP-2 though regulating the activities of Rac1, Cdc42 and their downstream transcriptional factor AP-1. ctivation of H-Ras and Rac1 correlates with epidermal growth factor-induced invasion in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells We have previously shown that H-Ras, but not N-Ras, induces an invasive phenotype mediated by small GTPase Rac1 in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. Moreover, siRNA-knockdown of Rac1 significantly inhibited the EGF-induced invasiveness in these cells. Our data demonstrate that the activation of H-Ras and the downstream molecule Rac1 correlates with EGF-induced breast cancer cell invasion, providing important information on the regulation of malignant progression in mammary carcinoma cells. At 50% growth-inhibiting concentration, icariin significantly suppressed tumor cells migration and invasion, which were traceable to down-regulation of Rac1 and VASP.  These results indicate that icariin exerts negative effects on tumor cell invasion and migration via the Rac1-dependent VASP pathway and may be a potential anti-cancer drug. RhoGDI2 modulates the invasiveness and metastatic ability of cancer cells through regulation of Rac1 activity. We also showed that GBM cells secrete Sema3A endogenously, and RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Sema3A inhibits migration and alters cell morphology that is dependent on Rac1 activity. LMO1 and Dock180, a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promote human glioma cell invasion Here, we report for the first time that engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) and dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180), a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), are evidently linked to the invasive phenotype of glioma cells. Inhibition of endogenous ELMO1 and Dock180 expression significantly impeded glioma cell invasion in vitro and in brain tissue slices with a concomitant reduction in Rac1 activation. Members of the Rac family of small GTPases are known to act as regulators of actin cytoskeletal structures and strongly influence the cellular processes of integrin-mediated adhesion and migration. Even though hyperactivated Rac proteins have been shown to influence metastatic processes, these proteins have never been directly linked to metastatic progression.  We show that increased activation of Rac proteins directly correlates with increasing metastatic potential in a panel of cell variants derived from a single metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-435). Expression of a dominant active Rac1 or a dominant active Rac3 resulted in a more invasive and motile phenotype. Moreover, expression of either dominant negative Rac1 or dominant negative Rac3 into the most metastatic cell variant resulted in decreased invasive and motile properties. This study correlates endogenous Rac activity with high metastatic potential and implicates Rac in the regulation of cell migration and invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest a role for both the Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases in human breast cancer progression."
Don't do chromatin features predict genes associated with eQTLs?,no,"Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict>90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Cell type-specific gene expression in humans involves complex interactions between regulatory factors and DNA at enhancers and promoters. Mapping studies for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin markers have become widely used tools for identifying gene regulatory elements, but prediction of target genes remains a major challenge. Here, we integrate genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes, proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes 150 kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators. Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at most 0.75 for using any single feature. We hope this study will not only provide validation of eQTL-mapping studies, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanisms explaining how genetic variation can influence gene expression."
Does resveratrol reduce cardiac remodeling?,yes,"In conclusion, resveratrol attenuated cardiac oxidative damage and left ventricular remodeling and enhanced the decreased expression of SIRT1 in hearts of old rats with emphysema and thus might be a therapeutic modality for cardiac injury complicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In conclusion, resveratrol is a beneficial pharmacological tool that augments autophagy to bring about reverse remodeling in the postinfarction heart. Resveratrol administration reduced atrial CSPC loss, succeeded in preserving the functional abilities of CSPCs and mature cardiac cells, improved cardiac environment by reducing inflammatory state and decreased unfavorable ventricular remodeling of the diabetic heart, leading to a marked recovery of ventricular function. These findings indicate that RSV can constitute an adjuvant therapeutic option in DCM prevention."
Isn't amoxicillin used for treatment of malnutrition in children?,no,"Another RCT did not show superiority of ceftriaxone over amoxicilllin for these same outcomes, but adressed SAM children with and without complications (p = 0.27). Another RCT showed no difference between amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole efficacies for pneumonia in underweight, but not SAM. Our meta-analysis of 12 pooled susceptibility-studies for all types of bacterial isolates, including 2767 stricly SAM children, favoured amoxicillin over cotrimoxazole for susceptibility medians: 42% (IQR 27-55%) vs 22% (IQR 17-23%) and population-weighted-means 52.9% (range 23-57%) vs 35.4% (range 6.7-42%).  Susceptibility-studies favour amoxicillin over cotrimoxazole.  Oral amoxicillin for 5 days was as effective as intramuscular ceftriaxone for 2 days (1 RCT). For uncomplicated SAM, amoxicillin showed no benefit over placebo (1 retrospective study).  Children who took amoxicillin and de-worming had 95% (HR = 1.95, 95%-CI = 1.17, 3.23) and 74% (HR = 1.74, 95%-CI = 1.07, 2.83) more probability to recover from SAM as compared to those who didn't take them. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned Malawian children, 6 to 59 months of age, with severe acute malnutrition to receive amoxicillin, cefdinir, or placebo for 7 days in addition to ready-to-use therapeutic food for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition.  In the amoxicillin, cefdinir, and placebo groups, 88.7%, 90.9%, and 85.1% of the children recovered, respectively (relative risk of treatment failure with placebo vs. amoxicillin, 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.68; relative risk with placebo vs. cefdinir, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.11). The mortality rates for the three groups were 4.8%, 4.1%, and 7.4%, respectively (relative risk of death with placebo vs. amoxicillin, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.24; relative risk with placebo vs. cefdinir, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.64). Evaluation of the routine use of amoxicillin as part of the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the inclusion of amoxicillin correlates with better recovery rates in the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition with ready-to-use therapeutic food. The standard protocol group received a 7-day course of amoxicillin at the onset of treatment. RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-eight children were treated according to the standard protocol with amoxicillin, and 1955 were treated under the alternate protocol without antibiotics.  The recovery rate for children who received amoxicillin was worse at 4 weeks (40%vs. 71%) but similar after up to 12 weeks of therapy (84%vs. 86%), compared to the children treated without antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This review of two therapeutic feeding programmes suggests that children with severe acute malnutrition who were treated without amoxicillin did not have an inferior rate of recovery.

Are there any functional differences between Mfd and its human Cocaine syndrome protein B (CSB) homolog?,yes,"In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. CSB has an ATPase activity that is stimulated strongly by DNA; however, it neither acts as a helicase nor does it dissociate stalled RNA polymerase II, suggesting a coupling mechanism in humans different from that in prokaryotes.  In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. In contrast, no difference was detected in the rate of transcription recovery in mfd, uvrA, fpg, nth, or polB dinB umuDC mutants relative to wild-type cells following oxidative damage"
Can botulism poisoning of a pregnant woman harm her fetus?,no,"Two botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. Three affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Botulinum toxin is not expected to be present in systemic circulation following proper intramuscular or intradermal injection. Moreover, BTX-A, which has a high molecular weight, does not appear to cross the placenta. From the 38 pregnancies reported in the literature, including women who had botulism poisoning during pregnancy, exposure to BTX-A does not appear to increase the risk of adverse outcome in the fetus. From the 38 pregnancies reported in the literature, including women who had botulism poisoning during pregnancy, exposure to BTX-A does not appear to increase the risk of adverse outcome in the fetus."
Isn't TALEN being used on stem cells?,no,"Precise correction of the dystrophin gene in duchenne muscular dystrophy patient induced pluripotent stem cells by TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9. Genetic correction of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9 holds promise for DMD gene therapy; however, the safety of such nuclease treatment must be determined. We generated helper-dependent, capsid-modified adenovirus (HD-Ad5/35) vectors for zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)- or transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated genome editing in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from mobilized adult donors.

A modified TALEN-based system for robust generation of knock-out human pluripotent stem cell lines and disease models. In this study, we utilized a cell-penetrating peptide-based system for ZFN and TALEN delivery. At all loci tested we obtained human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones carrying transgenic cassettes solely at the TALEN-specified location. We report here the use of TALENs to rapidly and efficiently generate mutant alleles of 15 genes in cultured somatic cells or human pluripotent stem cells, the latter for which we differentiated both the targeted lines and isogenic control lines into various metabolic cell types. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have been successfully used to knock out endogenous genes in stem cell research. Here we report different methods to efficiently perform TALEN-mediated gene integration and inactivation in different mammalian cell systems including induced pluripotent stem cells and delineate experimental examples associated with these approaches Together, our results demonstrate that TALE-based transcriptional repressor and TALENs are two promising approaches for loss-of-function studies of microRNA clusters in somatic cells and pluripotent stem cells We report here the use of TALENs to rapidly and efficiently generate mutant alleles of 15 genes in cultured somatic cells or human pluripotent stem cells, the latter for which we differentiated both the targeted lines and isogenic control lines into various metabolic cell types TALEN-mediated generation and genetic correction of disease-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells.

Using CRISPR-Cas9 and TALEN targeted human pluripotent stem cell clones, we performed whole-genome sequencing at high coverage in order to assess the degree of mutagenesis across the entire genome.  A 5% modification rate was observed in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) treated with TAT-TALEN as measured by the Surveyor assay.  TAT-TALEN protein-mediated gene disruption was applicable in hiPSCs and represents a promising technique for gene knockout in stem cells.

Our data suggest that TALENs employing the specific architectures described here mediate site-specific genome modification in human pluripotent cells with similar efficiency and precision as do zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs)."
Isn't Meis1 implicated in microphthalmia?,no,"Meis1 coordinates a network of genes implicated in eye development and microphthalmia. Here we show that haploinsufficiency of Meis1, which encodes a transcription factor with evolutionarily conserved expression in the embryonic trunk, brain and sensory organs, including the eye, causes microphthalmic traits and visual impairment in adult mice. We propose that Meis1 is at the core of a genetic network implicated in eye patterning/microphthalmia, and represents an additional candidate for syndromic cases of these ocular malformations.

Are mutations in the STXBP1 gene associated with epilepsy?,yes,"Folinic acid responsive epilepsy in Ohtahara syndrome caused by STXBP1 mutation. A novel mutation in STXBP1 gene in a child with epileptic encephalopathy and an atypical electroclinical pattern. Mutations in STXBP1 gene, encoding the syntaxin binding protein 1, have been recently described in Ohtahara syndrome, or early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern, and in other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies. STXBP1 (MUNC18.1), encoding syntaxin binding protein 1, has been reported in Ohtahara syndrome, a rare epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst pattern on EEG, in patients with infantile spasms and in a few patients with nonsyndromic mental retardation without epilepsy.  ed with severe developmental delay and poor prognosis.

Doesn't echinacea increase anaphylaxis risk?,no,"Chicoric acid (dicaffeoyl-tartaric acid), is a natural phenolic compound found in a number of plants, such as chicory (Cichorium intybus) and Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea), which possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and analgesic activities. Although these biological effects of chicoric acid have been investigated, there are no reports of its antiallergic-related anti-inflammatory effects in human mast cells (HMC)-1 or anaphylactic activity in a mouse model. BACKGROUND: Fifty percent of Australians use complementary and alternative medicines (other than vitamins) in any 12-month period, of which echinacea-containing products are increasingly popular. Recent reports have highlighted the risk of allergic reactions to complementary medicines in atopic patients. Two patients suffered anaphylaxis and a third had an acute asthma attack 10 minutes after their first ever dose of echinacea. Fifty-one Australian adverse drug reports implicating echinacea were also reviewed. There were 26 cases suggestive of possible immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity (4 anaphylaxis, 12 acute asthma, 10 urticaria/angioedema).  Echinacea-associated anaphylaxis. A woman with atopy experienced anaphylaxis after taking, among other dietary supplements, a commercial extract of echinacea. Risk of anaphylaxis in complementary and alternative medicine. Several culprits identified including Andrographis paniculata, Echinacea species, bee products, Ginkgo biloba and Ginseng are discussed here.SUMMARY: Knowing the factors that increase the risk of anaphylaxis allows reactions to be recognized, reported and further investigated."
Is there an association between bruxism and reflux?,yes,"Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. There was a statistical trend towards tooth wear progression being associated with gastric risk factors (p < 0.05).  This article presents a case report of a 27-year-old male smoker with tooth wear and dentin sensitivity caused by GERD associated with bruxism.  The aim of this cross-over, randomized, single-blinded trial was to examine whether intra-esophageal acidification induces sleep bruxism (SB).  RMMA episodes including SB were induced by esophageal acidification.  Chronic regurgitation of gastric acids in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease may cause dental erosion, which can lead in combination with attrition or bruxism to extensive loss of coronal tooth tissue. This clinical report describes treatment of severe tooth wear of a gastroesophageal reflux disease patient who is 54-year-old Turkish male patient. After his medical treatment, severe tooth wear, bruxism and decreased vertical dimensions were determined.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease by itself or in combination with attrition, abrasion or bruxism may be responsible for the loss. The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes.  The frequencies of RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes were significantly higher during decreased esophageal pH episodes than those during other times.  These results suggest that most jaw muscle activities, ie, RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes, occur in relation to gastroesophageal reflux mainly in the supine position. Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing."
Isn't RASA2 involved in melanoma?,no,"Analysis of 501 melanoma exomes identified RASA2, encoding a RasGAP, as a tumor-suppressor gene mutated in 5% of melanomas. Recurrent loss-of-function mutations in RASA2 were found to increase RAS activation, melanoma cell growth and migration. RASA2 expression was lost in ≥30% of human melanomas and was associated with reduced patient survival. These findings identify RASA2 inactivation as a melanoma driver and highlight the importance of RasGAPs in cancer.

Could Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?,yes,"Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a type of cardiac arrhythmia that occurs in people with a structurally normal heart. Stress or anxiety-induced release of endogenous catecholamines causes a dysfunction in the myocytic calcium-ion channel, leading to ventricular arrhythmias that can cause dizziness, syncope, or sudden cardiac death.  During a follow-up of 48±94 months, arrhythmia events (sudden cardiac death and aborted cardiac arrest) associated with noncompliance occurred in 2 patients.  We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryanodine receptor.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS), leave no evidence to be found at autopsy a spectrum of sudden cardiac death (SCD)-predisposing heritable cardiac arrhythmia syndromes, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  CPVT is a familial arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by abnormal calcium (Ca(2+)) handling, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death Mutations in RyR2 are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and sudden cardiac death. Patients with CPVT often present with exercise- or emotion induced syncope, the first presentation can also be sudden cardiac death. Among the five major arrhythmogenic disorders occurring in the absence of a structural heart disease is catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which is a highly lethal form of inherited arrhythmias.  Patients with CPVT are at high risk of developing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when untreated.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by VT induced by adrenergic stress in the absence of structural heart disease and high incidence of sudden cardiac death.  CPVT is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by gene mutations that destabilize cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels. Sudden cardiac death is incompletely prevented by conventional drug therapy with β-blockers with or without Ca(2+) channel blockers.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) are primary inherited arrhythmia syndromes that may cause syncope and sudden cardiac death in young individuals.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder that causes syncopal episodes related with stress or emotion and even sudden cardiac deaths. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia caused by mutations in the RyR2 gene manifests as severe arrhythmias, and may provide a candidate for sudden cardiac deaths. Patients diagnosed with an electrical cardiomyopathy have an increased risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD).  Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms.  Over 80% of SCD occurs in patients with organic heart disease. However, approximately 10-15% of SCD occurs in the presence of structurally normal heart and the majority of those patients are young. In this group of patients, changes in genes encoding cardiac ion channels produce modification of the function of the channel resulting in an electrophysiological substrate of VA and SCD. Collectively these disorders are referred to as Cardiac Ion Channelopathies. The 4 major syndromes in this group are: The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), the Brugada Syndrome (BrS), the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS), and the Catecholaminergic Polymorphic VT (CPVT).  Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (CPVT).  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. It occurs in patients with structurally normal heart and causes exercise-emotion-triggered syncope and sudden cardiac death. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) Aberrant spontaneous, diastolic Ca2+ leak from the SR due to dysfunctional RyR2 contributes to the formation of delayed after-depolarisations, which are thought to underlie the fatal arrhythmia that occurs in both heart failure (HF) and in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Mutations in RyR2 have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a heritable arrhythmia unmasked by exertion or stress, characterized by triggered activity and sudden cardiac death in affected patients. families that exhibit CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), a condition in which physical or emotional stress can trigger severe tachyarrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. that often leads to sudden death in HF and in CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited disease characterized by adrenergically mediated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia leading to syncope and sudden cardiac death. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by adrenergic induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardias and associated with sudden cardiac death.  These data suggest that ""leaky"" RyR2 channels can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias, providing a possible explanation for CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by syncopal events and sudden cardiac death at a young age during physical stress or emotion, in the absence of structural heart disease.   catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) account for a relevant proportion of sudden cardiac death cases in young patients cohorts.  has recently been shown to be involved in at least two forms of sudden cardiac death (SCD): (1) Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)"

Isn't pregnancy an additional risk during during H1N1 infection?,no,"H1N1 influenza in pregnancy can be associated with severe complications This case series confirms a high number of complications in pregnant women due to pandemic H1N1/09. Pregnant women might be at increased risk for complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection. Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from pandemic influenza H1N1 virus infection.  Vaccination of pregnant women against influenza A (H1N1) by Russian subunit formulation (MonoGrippol plus) showed reactogenicity comparable to control group by the level of influence on general metabolic and immunologic homeostasis and on the course of pregnancy, which is an evidence of its safety Pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010 While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to H1N1 influenza virus in pregnant women. Although limited in size, the fully prospective nature of the safety follow-up of these women vaccinated during pregnancy is unique and offers an important degree of reassurance for the use of the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 (2009) vaccine in this high risk group for H1N1 infection. During the H1N1 2009 pandemic, pregnant women constituted one of the priority groups for vaccination in many countries, creating a need for close monitoring of the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women Emerging data suggest that pregnancy conveys high risk for severe complications from the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (2009 H1N1) infection Pregnant women have been identified as a group at risk, both for respiratory complications than for the admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic This report mitigates substantially the presumed severity of pandemic H1N1/09 influenza infection during pregnancy The results of our study do not indicate a risk for the pregnant woman and the developing embryo/fetus after H1N1 vaccination This large cohort study found no evidence of an increased risk of fetal death associated with exposure to an adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine during pregnancy Our results suggest that second- or third-trimester H1N1 vaccination was associated with improved fetal and neonatal outcomes during the recent pandemic Pregnant women might thus be at increased risk of complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection, and illness may progress rapidly Pregnant women with H1N1 infection seem to benefit from antiviral therapy. arly identification and treatment were the most important factors in different countries and areas examined. The vaccine and antiviral drugs that have been the most efficient means to control the novel virus appear to be safe but require more extensive study However, there were significant differences between the two groups in relation to mean age, treatment with oseltamivir, schooling, and presence of other risk factors To investigate whether exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. In this Danish cohort, exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of major birth defects, preterm birth, or fetal growth restriction Most people affected by the virus, including pregnant women, suffer a mild viral illness, and make a full recovery Pregnant women, because of their altered immunity and physiological adaptations, are at higher risk of developing pulmonary complications, especially in the second and third trimesters The pregnancy outcomes were also poor for women who were affected by the virus with a fivefold increase in the perinatal mortality rate and threefold increase in the preterm delivery rate regnant women were at increased risk for serious outcomes of 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (influenza A[H1N1]pdm09) infection, but little is known about the overall impact of the pandemic on neonatal and maternal outcomes In this large, geographically diverse population, A(H1N1)pdm09 infection increased the risk for hospitalization during pregnancy Vaccination during pregnancy with Pandemrix(®) appeared to have no ill effects on the pregnancy. On the contrary, the rate of preterm birth and low birthweight was lower than expected, which agrees with some previous results During the influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 pandemic, although many cases occurred in younger adults, the risk factors identified for severe infections and complications were similar to those for seasonal influenza, including chronic respiratory, renal, liver, and heart diseases. In terms of pregnancy, the studies have shown contradictory results due to variations in methodology and medical care. However, it seems that pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, increases the risk of complications, and that early antiviral treatment is associated with improved outcomes. Pregnant women with mild clinical illness secondary to 2009 H1N1 were not at a greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes However, severely infected women were more likely to deliver SGA infants Gestational age is associated with the risk of developing critical infection. The risk increases with increasing weeks of gestation.  Following the start of winter in Liaoning province in China, the number of pregnant women infected with influenza increased significantly regnancy, with or without additional complications, constitutes a high-risk condition for complications of influenza infection and warrants early intervention with neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, if influenza is suspected"
Is the protein KCNQ2 associated with idiopathic epilepsy?,yes,"Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy (JIE) in Arabian foals resembles benign-familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC) syndrome, a rare idiopathic epilepsy of new-born humans. BFNC syndrome exhibits genetic heterogeneity, as has been hypothesised to occur in Arabian foals, and is known to be caused by mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes. They also demonstrate that sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common IE syndromes. The underlying genetic abnormalities of rare familial idiopathic epilepsy have been identified, such as mutation in KCNQ2, a K(+) channel gene. Sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common idiopathic epilepsy syndromes. This paper summarizes recent findings concerning sodium (SCN1A) and potassium channel (KCNQ2 and KCNQ3) dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of rare and common idiopathic epilepsies (IE).  Mutations in the SCN1A gene are found in up to 80% of individuals with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), and mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were identified in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) as well as in single families with Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE). The involvement of KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) and KCNQ3 (Kv7.3) in a benign idiopathic neonatal epilepsy, KCNQ4 (Kv7.4) in a form of congenital deafness, and the discovery that neuronal KCNQ heteromultimers were among the molecular substrates of M-channels, resulted in a high level of interest for potential drug development strategies Mutations in the SCN1A gene are found in up to 80% of individuals with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), and mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were identified in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) as well as in single families with Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) The functional interaction between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 provides a framework for understanding how mutations in either channel can cause a form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy Mutations in KCNQ2- or KCNQ3-encoding genes cause benign familiar neonatal convulsions (BFNCs), a rare autosomal-dominant idiopathic epilepsy of the newborn Mutations in KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 that reduce the M-current are responsible for benign familial neonatal seizures, a rare autosomal dominant idiopathic epilepsy of the newborn These include benign familial neonatal convulsions due to mutations in KCNQ2 or KCNQ3, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus due to mutations in SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN1B, and GABRG2, autosomal-dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) due to a mutation in GABRA1 and mutations in CLCN2 associated with several IGE sub-types KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations contribute to different idiopathic epilepsy syndromes Role of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes in juvenile idiopathic epilepsy in Arabian foals Mutations in the voltage gated potassium channel gene KCNQ2 and the homologous gene KCNQ3 have been found to cause a rare monogenic subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, the benign familial neonatal convulsions Role of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes in juvenile idiopathic epilepsy in Arabian foals. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations contribute to different idiopathic epilepsy syndromes."
Are epigenetic modifications implicated in cardiovascular development and disease?,yes,"Gene expression regulation through the interplay of DNA methylation and histone modifications is well-established, although the knowledge about the function of epigenetic signatures in cardiovascular disease is still largely unexplored. The study of epigenetic markers is, therefore, a very promising frontier of science which may aid in a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of gene expression in the biomolecule pathways linked to cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights our current knowledge of epigenetic gene regulation and the evidence that chromatin remodeling and histone modifications play key roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease through (re)programming of cardiovascular (stem) cells commitment, identity and function. Notably, multiple subunits of switching defective/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes have been identified as strong candidates underlying these defects because they physically and functionally interact with cardiogenic transcription factors critical to cardiac development, such as TBX5, GATA-4, and NKX2-5. While these studies indicate a critical role of SWI/SNF complexes in cardiac development and congenital heart disease, many exciting new discoveries have identified their critical role in the adult heart in both physiological and pathological conditions involving multiple cell types in the heart, including cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and neural crest cells. Recent studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the regulation of cardiovascular development at the chromatin level, including the remodeling of chromatin and the modification of histones. Chromatin-level regulation integrates multiple inputs and coordinates broad gene expression programs. Thus, understanding chromatin-level regulation will allow for a better appreciation of gene regulation as a whole and may set a fundamental basis for cardiovascular disease. Genetic and epigenetic factors are of great importance in cardiovascular biology and disease. Tobacco-smoking, one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors, is itself partially determined by genetic background and is associated with altered epigenetic patterns. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification (acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation) and miRNA, are critical for regulating developmental events. However, aberrant epigenetic mechanisms may lead to pathological consequences such as cardiovascular disease (CAD), neurodegenerative disease, obesity, metabolic disorder, bone and skeletal diseases and various cancers. Cardiovascular disease pathways are now being approached from the epigenetic perspective, including those associated with atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, ischemia-reperfusion damage, and the cardiovascular response to hypoxia and shear stress, among many others. With increasing interest and expanding partnerships in the field, we can expect new insights to emerge from epigenetic perspectives of cardiovascular health. Epigenetic modifications are heritable alterations of the genome, which can govern gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. The purpose of this review is to render an overview of the possible mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in response to environmental pollutants leading to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). From varied study approaches directed either toward the general understanding of the key pathway regulatory genes, or sampling population cohorts for global and gene-specific changes, it has been possible to identify several epigenetic signatures of environmental exposure relevant to CVD. An understanding of chromatin remodelling in response to environmental stimuli conducive to CVD is emerging, with the promise of novel diagnostic and therapeutic candidates. Consolidated knowledge is accumulating as to the role of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of vascular development and vascular tone as well as in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The modulation of gene expression through modification of the epigenome by structural changes of the chromatin architecture without alterations of the associated genomic DNA sequence is part of the cellular response to environmental changes. Such environmental conditions, which are finally being translated into adaptations of the cardiovascular system, also comprise pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction.  Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Histone modifications lead to the modulation of the expression of genetic information through modification of DNA accessibility. In addition, RNA-based mechanisms (e.g., microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) influence the development of disease. We here outline the recent work pertaining to epigenetic changes in a cardiovascular disease setting. Epigenetics may represent one of the possible scientific explanations of the impact of such intrauterine risk factors for the subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) during adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA alterations, which collectively enable the cell to respond quickly to environmental changes. A number of CVD risk factors, such as nutrition, smoking, pollution, stress, and the circadian rhythm, have been associated with modification of epigenetic marks. Further examination of these mechanisms may lead to earlier prevention and novel therapy for CVD.  Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic alterations are associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease Epigenetic mechanisms that underpin metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Epigenetic regulation of cardiovascular differentiation. Epigenetic control mechanisms play a key role in the regulation of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis and modulate cardiovascular diseases."
Are seizures among the neurological symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti?,yes,"High-dose glucocorticoid therapy in the management of seizures in neonatal incontinentia pigmenti Incontinentia pigmenti is an X-linked dominant disorder resulting from a mutation of IKBKG. This disorder has a classic dermatologic presentation, but neurologic involvement, with seizures and cortical infarction, can arise shortly after birth Some children with incontinentia pigmenti exhibit encephalopathic features with severe seizures and disturbed consciousness, from the neonatal through the early infantile period Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked dominant neurocutaneous disorder affecting ectodermal tissue: skin, eyes, central nervous system, hair, nails, and teeth. It is usually lethal for males in utero. The involved gene is NEMO, an essential component of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Skin lesions are highly diagnostic, occurring in neonates, with a particular distribution on Blaschko lines. The severity of the disease is related to ocular and neurological impairment. The hallmark of ocular IP is retinal vasculopathy including peripheral retinal vascular nonperfusion, macular infarction and neovascularization, and preretinal neovascularization. CNS involvement consists of seizures, mental retardation, hemiparesis, spasticity, microcephaly, cerebellar ataxia, and coma Incontinentia Pigmenti is a rare X-linked multisystem disorder with well described and pathognomonic skin manifestations. Neurological manifestations are found in 30% of IP patients, forming one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality of the condition.

Aren't CD44 variants (CD44v) associated with poor prognosis of metastasis?,no,"CD44 variants and prognosis The CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms have been noted as markers for tumour metastasis and prognosis in several adenocarcinomas. Positive CD44v3 expression was associated with more advanced pathological stage and poorer prognosis than negative CD44v3 expression CD44v6 expression in the adenocarcinoma component may directly affect the behavior of carcinoma and the prognosis of patients D44 variant 6 in endometrioid carcinoma of the uterus: its expression in the adenocarcinoma component is an independent prognostic marker CD44v5 expression is independently positively correlated with the aggressiveness of thymic epithelial tumors. The expression of CD44v5 may be a potential trigger of tumor invasion in thymomas analysis of CD44v expression provides indications of biological and clinical relevance also in low grade lymphoproliferative disorders clinical relevance of CD44 variant isoform expression on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia CD44 variants and its association with survival in pancreatic cancer CD44 variant 6(v6) molecule has been noted as a marker for tumor metastasis and prognosis in several tumors CD44v2 and CD44v6 may be useful markers for poor prognosis in curatively resected primary pancreatic cancer CD44v8-10 may play an important role in the adhesion of tumor cells to the capillaries of distant organs in the metastatic process, and that immunohistochemical detection of CD44v8-10 may be a biologic marker of prognostic significance. combined expression of CD44v8-10 and SLX may be a biologic marker of prognostic significance variant isoforms (CD44v) are expressed on different malignant cells and tissues. Their upregulation has been implicated, in the progression and metastasis of malignomas. expression of the CD44 variant exon 6 is associated with lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer a number of variant forms of CD44 are frequently expressed, although these variants are infrequently expressed in normal lung tissue, and that the expression of CD44v6 is particularly associated with lymph node metastasis in NSCLC Expression of CD44v6 may suggest an increased risk for local lymph node metastasis in NSCLCs different CD44 isoforms are found in human skin cancers and are modulated during carcinogenesis D44 isoforms correlate with cellular differentiation but not with prognosis in human breast cancer Correlations between prognosis and expression of CD44v have been reported for gastric and colon carcinoma, for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and recently for breast carcinoma Certain splice variants (CD44v) can promote the metastatic behaviour of cancer cells. In human colon and breast cancer the presence of epitopes encoded by exon v6 on primary resected tumour material indicates poor prognosis In human mammary carcinomas and colorectal carcinomas, the expression of CD44v has also been correlated with more progressed tumor stages."
Are shadow enhancers associated with development?,yes,"Critical developmental control genes sometimes contain ""shadow"" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes These results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes ""bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions"" Shadow enhancers flanking the HoxB cluster direct dynamic Hox expression in early heart and endoderm development.  This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development. Regulatory analysis of the HoxA complex reveals that it also has enhancers in the 3' flanking region which contain RAREs and have the potential to modulate expression in endoderm and heart tissues This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development. Recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns: primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or 'shadow', enhancers located at more remote positions. Together, the similarities in their location, enhancer output, and dependence on retinoid signaling suggest that a conserved cis-regulatory cassette located in the 3' proximal regions adjacent to the HoxA and HoxB complexes evolved to modulate Hox gene expression during mammalian cardiac and endoderm development.  This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development."
Isn't sternotomy closure done using either a sternal ZipFix™ implant or conventional steel wire following cardiac surgery?,no,"o determine the difference in sternal infection and other infectious events between conventional wire and cable-tie-based closure techniques post-sternotomy in a collective of patients after cardiac surgery. Our study underlines a neutral effect of the sternal ZipFix™ system in patients regarding sternal infection. Postoperative complications are similar in both sternal closure methods. The cable-tie-based system is fast, easy to use, reliable and safe.  Wire closure still remains the preferred technique despite reasonable disadvantages. Associated complications, such as infection and sternal instability, cause time- and cost-consuming therapies. We present a new tool for sternal closure with its first clinical experience and results.METHODS: The sternal ZipFix(TM) System is based on the cable-tie principle.  In our initial evaluation, the short-term results have shown that the sternal ZipFix(TM) can be used safely and effectively.

Is exome sequencing efficient for the detection of germline mutations?,yes,"Whole exome sequencing is an efficient and sensitive method for detection of germline mutations in patients with phaeochromcytomas and paragangliomas Whole exome sequencing is sensitive, rapid and efficient for detection of PCC/PGL germline mutations. These results from deep sequencing demonstrate a higher mutational detection rate than reported with conventional sequencing methodology. We performed exome sequencing of germline DNA from members of the affected family. Exome-wide analysis identified a novel loss-of-function mutation in the BAP1 gene, previously suggested as a tumor suppressor. whole-exome sequencing has been widely applied in the identification of germline mutations underlying Mendelian disorders, somatic mutations in various cancers and de novo mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders."
Is miR-21 related to carcinogenesis?,yes,"miR-21* and miR-203 were significantly dysregulated (P < 0.05) in PTC tissues with BRAFV600E. Expressions of miRNAs in papillary thyroid carcinoma and their associations with the BRAFV600E mutation. Levels of miRNA-21 (miR-21) and miR-106a in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher compared with the levels in adjacent tissues (P = .006 and P = .001, respectively). Patients who had gastric cancer had significantly different levels of gastric juice miR-21 and miR-106a compared with patients who had benign gastric diseases (both P < .001). miR-21 levels in intestinal type gastric cancer specimens were higher than that in diffuse (P = .003) or mixed (P < .001) gastric cancer types. MiR-155 and miR-21 appeared significantly over-expressed in the colonic mucosa of IBD subjects without CRC, but also in neoplastic tissues of IBD patients compared to non-IBD controls (p<0.001). Importantly, in patients with IBD-CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 over-expression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (p<0.001). Here we hypothesize that over-expression of miR-155 and miR-21, two inflammation-related miRNAs that target core MMR proteins, may constitute a pre-neoplastic event for the development of MSI IBD-CRCs. After administration, we determined the expressions of miR-21, miR-27a, miR-34a, miR-93, miR-143, miR-146a, miR-148a, miR-155, miR-196a, miR-203, miR-205, miR-221 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells-1 (Nfκb1), mitogen-activated protein kinase-8 (Mapk8) and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras) genes in the liver of mice. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a tumor suppressor gene whose expression is controlled by miR-21. Consistently with PDCD4 downregulation, miR-21 was upregulated in neoplastic by comparison with nonneoplastic tissue samples. Expression of miR-21 (p=0.027), miR-181b (p=0.002), and miR-146b (p=0.021) in tumor tissue and miR-21 (p=0.003) in noncancerous tissue were associated with patients' overall survival. We analyzed the expression of nine miRNAs (miR-21, miR-127, miR-154, miR-224, miR-323, miR-370, miR-9*, miR-183, and miR-375) by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction in 34 cases of sMTC, 6 cases of hMTC, and 2 cases of C-cell hyperplasia (CCH). MTC and CCH were both characterized by a significant overexpression of the whole set of miRNAs (the increase being 4.2-fold for miR-21, 6.7-fold for miR-127, 8.8-fold for miR-154, 6.6-fold for miR-224, 5.8-fold for miR-323, 6.1-fold for miR-370, 13-fold for miR-9*, 6.7-fold for miR-183, and 10.1 for miR-375, p<0.0001). The most frequent changes in miRNAs in CLL cells included downregulation of miR-126, miR-572, miR-494, miR-923, miR-638, miR-130a, miR-181a and miR-181b and up-regulation of miR-29a, miR-660, miR-20a, miR-106b, miR-142-5p, miR-101, miR-30b, miR-34a, miR-let-7f, miR-21 and miR-155. Results: MTC and CCH were both characterized by a significant overexpression of the whole set of miRNAs (the increase being 4.2-fold for miR-21, 6.7-fold for miR-127, 8.8-fold for miR-154, 6.6-fold for miR-224, 5.8-fold for miR-323 and 6.1-fold for miR-370, 13-fold for miR-9*, 6.7-fold for miR-183 and 10.1 for miR-375, p<0.0001). We found that the onco-miRNAs miR-21 and miR-221 displayed upregulated expression while the liver-specific miR-122 was downregulated. The aim of the present review was to describe the mechanisms of several known miR, summarize recent studies on oncogenic miR (e.g. miR-21, miR-106a and miR-17), tumor suppressor miR (e.g. miR-101, miR-181, miR-449, miR-486, let-7a) and controversial roles of miR (e.g. miR-107, miR-126) for gastric cancer. MiR-15b and miR-21 were differentially expressed in CSF samples from patients with gliomas, compared to control subjects with various neurologic disorders, including patients with primary CNS lymphoma and carcinomatous brain metastases. Moreover, inclusion of miR-15b and miR-21 in combined expression analyses resulted in an increased diagnostic accuracy with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity to distinguish patients with glioma from control subjects and patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Many aberrantly expressed miRNAs were related to various cancers (e.g., miR-125b, hepatocellular carcinoma; miR-21, leukemia; miR-16, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; miR-192, pituitary adenomas; miR-199a-3p, ovarian cancer; miR-34a, pancreatic cancer). Several miRNAs (e.g., miR-34a, miR-21) and proteins (e.g., TGM2, NDRG2) that play crucial roles in liver tumorigenesis were first found to be affected by MC-LR in mouse liver. Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. In addition, diet and carcinogen exposure modulated a number of microRNAs (miR-16, miR-19b, miR-21, miR26b, miR27b, miR-93, and miR-203) linked to canonical oncogenic signaling pathways. RESULTS: Elevated miR-21 (HR 2.06, 1.13-3.75), miR-17 (HR 2.00, 1.10-3.61), and miR-155 (HR 2.37, 1.27-4.42) was associated with worse cancer-specific mortality in the Maryland cohort. NF-κB targets miR-16 and miR-21 in gastric cancer: involvement of prostaglandin E receptors. Expression of miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155, and let-7a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 639 IALT patients. hese two miRNAs have previously been identified as being overexpressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with miR-21 specifically implicated in down-regulating the tumor suppressor gene, tropomyosin-1. MicroRNA-21 is involved in ionizing radiation-promoted liver carcinogenesis. We showed here that among several hundred miRNAs, miR-21 was the only one that increased 6 folds in high-LET IR-promoted mouse liver tumors when compared with that in the non-irradiated liver tissues. We also showed that miR-21 was up-regulated in human or mouse hepatocytes after exposure to IR, as well as in liver tissues derived from whole body irradiated mice. After the non-irradiated, low-LET or high-LET irradiated human hepatocytes were over-expressed with miR-21, these cells became tumorigenesis in nude mice. METHODS: We used this combined ISH/IHC assay to study a subset of cancer-associated miRNAs, including miRNAs frequently detected at low (miR-34a and miR-126) and high (miR-21 and miR-155) levels, in a panel of breast, colorectal, lung, pancreas, and prostate carcinomas. The miR-15a, miR-16, miR-143, miR-155, and miR-21 were upregulated in M059K, and the modulation of these miRNAs fluctuated in M059J cells in a time-dependent manner. Aberrantly increased expression of miR-21 plays a significant role in lung carcinogenesis and is a potential therapeutic target in both epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant and wild-type cases. Additionally, high miR-21 expression was associated with significantly decreased 5 year survival in patients (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% CI: 1.04-2.77) in a model controlled for patient age, gender and tumor stage. ESULTS: In adenocarcinoma patients, miR-21, miR-223, miR-192, and miR-194 expression was elevated, whereas miR-203 expression was reduced in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. Significantly, elevated miR-21 expression in noncancerous tissue of SCC patients and reduced levels of miR-375 in cancerous tissue of adenocarcinoma patients with Barrett's were strongly associated with worse prognosis. miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were consistently upregulated, whereas miR-1 and miR-143 were downregulated in lung tumors relative to normal lungs. In mice treated with VC and given I3C in the diet, levels of miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were reduced relative to the level in mice treated with the carcinogen only. Further studies with miR-21 indicated that phosphatase and tensin homolog, programmed cell death 4 and rich protein with Kazal motifs are potential targets for the oncogenic effect of miR-21 and the chemopreventive activity of I3C. This study examines the potential clinical utility of an inflammatory gene expression signature as a prognostic biomarker for colon cancer in addition to previously examined miR-21 expression. CONCLUSIONS: IRS and miR-21 expression are independent predictors of colon cancer prognosis and may provide a clinically useful tool to identify high-risk patients. The most highly expressed miRNAs in gastric cancer tissues were miR-20b, miR-20a, miR-17, miR-106a, miR-18a, miR-21, miR-106b, miR-18b, miR-421, miR-340*, miR-19a and miR-658. Recent findings report their involvement in hair follicle morphogenesis (ablation of miRNAs from keratinocytes causes several defects, such as evagination instead of invagination), in psoriasis (skin-specific expression of miR-203 and psoriasisspecific expression of miR-146a, miR-21 and miR-125b in the skin), in autoimmune diseases affecting the skin, such as SLE and ITP, in wound healing (changes in the expression of specific miRNA at specific phases of the regeneration process), and in skin carcinogenesis (a novel miRNA signature that includes induction of miR-21, a candidate oncogenic miRNA). RESULTS: Several microRNAs were differentially expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovarian tissues, including miR-21, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-100, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-99a, which were each differentially expressed in >16 patients. Selected for validation were miR-20a, miR-21, miR-106a, miR-181b, and miR-203, and all 5 were enriched in tumors from the validation cohort (P < .001). Higher miR-21 expression was present in adenomas (P = .006) and in tumors with more advanced TNM staging (P < .001). In situ hybridization demonstrated miR-21 to be expressed at high levels in colonic carcinoma cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied the pharmacologic roles of three microRNAs previously implicated in cancer biology (let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21) and also used in silico methods to test pharmacologic microRNA effects more broadly. Changing the cellular levels of let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21 affected the potencies of a number of the anticancer agents by up to 4-fold. The effect was most prominent with mir-21, with 10 of 28 cell-compound pairs showing significant shifts in growth-inhibitory activity. Varying mir-21 levels changed potencies in opposite directions depending on compound class; indicating that different mechanisms determine toxic and protective effects. In silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Conversely, expression of other miRNAs was detected at varying levels predominantly within luminal epithelial cells in normal tissue; expression of miR-21 was frequently increased, whereas that of let-7a was decreased in malignant cells. We describe a novel EMT-specific microRNA signature that includes induction of miR-21, a candidate oncogenic microRNA associated with carcinogenesis. Notable was the high expression of miR-21 and miR-205. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key actors in carcinogenesis and we demonstrated that microRNA-21 (miR-21), oncomiR is expressed early during PDA. These results indicated that miR-21 plays a role in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of O. viverrini-associated CCA by suppressing the function of PDCD4. Importantly, in patients with IBD CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 overexpression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (P < 0.001). Ectopic overexpression of miR-21 promoted Akt activation and phosphorylation of EZH2, whereas inhibiting miR-21 by transfecting the cells with anti-miR-21 inhibited Akt activation and EZH2 phosphorylation. PDCD4 nuclear down-regulation (which parallels miR-21 up-regulation) is involved in the molecular pathway of IBD-associated carcinogenesis. The expression levels of miR-21 (p = 0.027), miR-181b (p = 0.002) and miR-146b (p = 0.021) in tumor tissue and miR-21 (p = 0.003) in noncancerous tissue were associated with overall survival of patients. OBJECTIVE: As an important oncogenic miRNA, miR-21 has been reported to play crucial roles in glioblastoma (GBM) carcinogenesis. We further analyzed the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21), an oncogenic noncoding RNA involved in oncogenic Ras signaling, by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) plays crucial roles in carcinogenesis and is considered as one of the most studied oncomiRNAs. Although microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis, its functions and molecular mechanisms in carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis are unclear. Substantial evidence indicates that microRNA-21 (miR-21) is a key oncomiR in carcinogenesis and is significantly elevated in multiple myeloma (MM). MicroRNA 21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis. Conversely, pAkt and miR-21 expression was significantly up-regulated in the whole spectrum of preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions considered. Several miRNAs (e.g., miR-34a, miR-21) and proteins (e.g., TGM2, NDRG2) that play crucial roles in liver tumorigenesis were first found to be affected by MC-LR in mouse liver. RESULTS: Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. MicroRNA 21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in virtually all types of carcinomas and various types of hematological malignancies. As expected, miR-21 expression was significantly upregulated in preneoplastic/neoplastic samples, consistent with PDCD4 downregulation. Furthermore, miR-21 levels in the primary tumours correlated with disease stage (P < 0.0001). We found that miR-16 and miR-21 were upregulated upon nicotine stimulation, transfection with anti-miR-16 or anti-miR-21 significantly abrogated cell proliferation. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a unique miRNA in that it is overexpressed in most tumour types analysed so far. Although altered expressions of miR-21 and miR-34a were manifested within cancer cells, those of miR-126 and miR-155 were predominantly confined to endothelial cells and immune cells, respectively. However, the function of miR-21 in osteosarcoma is still unclear. In SCC patients, we found elevated miR-21 and reduced miR-375 expression levels in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were consistently upregulated, whereas miR-1 and miR-143 were downregulated in lung tumors relative to normal lungs. Precancerous adenomas also frequently showed miR-21 up-regulation. Higher miR-21 expression was present in adenomas (P = .006) Importantly, the inflammatory ZD esophagus had a distinct microRNA signature resembling human ESCC or tongue SCC miRNAomes with miR-31 and miR-21 as the top-up-regulated species. Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some upregulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells. OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is one of the miRNAs that are frequently and highly overexpressed in tumor tissue of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients; however, only a little is known about its functional role in CRC. Inhibition of microRNA-21 (mir‑21) induced upregulation of Spry2             and PTEN which underscores the importance of mir-21 in Spry2-associated tumorigenesis             of the colon. The microRNA miR-21, a known oncogenic miRNA, was found to be upregulated in papillary and clear cell carcinomas. Since microRNA-21 (miR-21) may contribute to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in many cancer types, we aimed to investigate its efficacy in TCCs. Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some up-regulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells. In this study, by using high-throughput microRNA profiling, we identified that two miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-148a) overexpressed in CD4+ T cells from both patients with lupus and lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, which promote cell hypomethylation by repressing DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. The microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been identified as the only miRNA overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including leukemia. OBJECTIVE: The contribution of overexpressed microRNA-21 and -221 (miR-21 and miR-221) to the malignant phenotype was determined by inhibiting these miRNAs using antisense oligonucleotides. The microRNA-21(miR-21) has been identified as the only miRNA over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers, including cervical cancer. To determine the functions of these microRNAs in lymphomagenesis, we examined the effects of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting miR-21 (ASO-21) and/or miR-155 (ASO-155) in NK-cell lymphoma lines overexpressing one or both of these miRNAs. In this study, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of 28 cases of never-smoker lung cancer identified aberrantly expressed miRNAs, which were much fewer than in lung cancers of smokers and included miRNAs previously identified (e.g., up-regulated miR-21) and unidentified (e.g., down-regulated miR-138) in those smoker cases. The oncogenic miRNA, microRNA-21 (miR-21), was found to be upregulated in laryngeal carcinoma tissues. OBJECTIVE: To better understand microRNA miR-21 function in carcinogenesis, we analyzed miR-21 expression patterns in different stages of colorectal cancer development using in situ hybridization (ISH). Of these miRNAs, miR-21 appears to be important in tumorigenesis given its up-regulation in almost all types of human cancer examined. The microRNA-21 gene (mir-21) has been identified as the only miRNA commonly overexpressed in solid tumors of the lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, brain, head and neck, esophagus and pancreas. RESULTS: Our data showed that a common pattern of microRNA expression distinguishes any tumor type from normal pancreas, suggesting that this set of microRNAs might be involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis; the expression of miR-103 and miR-107, associated with lack of expression of miR-155, discriminates tumors from normal; a set of 10 microRNAs distinguishes endocrine from acinar tumors and is possibly associated with either normal endocrine differentiation or endocrine tumorigenesis; miR-204 is primarily expressed in insulinomas and correlates with immunohistochemical expression of insulin; and the overexpression of miR-21 is strongly associated with both a high Ki67 proliferation index and presence of liver metastasis. To search for tumor-associated mutations that could affect processing and expression of mature miRNAs, a panel of 91 cancer-derived cell lines was analyzed for sequence variations in 15 miRNAs implicated in tumorigenesis by virtue of their known target transcripts (let-7 family targeting oncogenic Ras) or their localization to sites of frequent chromosomal instability (miR-143, miR-145, miR-26a-1, and miR-21)."
Don't have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,yes,"In conclusion, trace amines and thyronamines are negative inotropic agents. Their in vivo administration induces effects opposite to those induced by thyroid hormone, including lowering of body temperature."
Isn't macitentan an ET agonist?,yes,"Administration of an ET receptor antagonist, either bosentan or macitentan, markedly attenuated PD-induced MMT, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and peritoneal functional decline.  Macitentan is an oral, once-daily, dual endothelin (ET)A and ETB receptor antagonist with high affinity and sustained receptor binding that was approved in the USA, Europe, Canada, and Switzerland for the treatment of PAH. Macitentan (Opsumit®) is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with sustained receptor binding properties developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Macitentan, also called Actelion-1 or ACT-064992 [N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-(2-(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yloxy)ethoxy)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-N'-propylaminosulfonamide], is a new dual ET(A)/ET(B) endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist designed for tissue targeting. Selection of macitentan was based on inhibitory potency on both ET receptors and optimization of physicochemical properties to achieve high affinity for lipophilic milieu. In vivo, macitentan is metabolized into a major and pharmacologically active metabolite, ACT-132577.  Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range. In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors). In rats with pulmonary hypertension, macitentan prevented both the increase of pulmonary pressure and the right ventricle hypertrophy, and it markedly improved survival.  In conclusion, macitentan, by its tissue-targeting properties and dual antagonism of ET receptors, protects against end-organ damage in diabetes and improves survival in pulmonary hypertensive rats. This profile makes macitentan a new agent to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with chronic tissue ET system activation. Pharmacology of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Renal, retinal and cardiac changes in type 2 diabetes are attenuated by macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Here we investigated the effects of macitentan, an orally-active, tissue-targeting dual ET receptor antagonist on chronic complications in type 2 diabetes.MAIN METHODS: db/db mice and their age- and sex-matched controls were examined after 2 and 4 months of diabetes.  Macitentan is a novel dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist with enhanced tissue distribution and sustained receptor binding properties designed to achieve a more efficacious ET receptor blockade.  Recently oral prostacyclin receptor agonists have shown encouraging results. Many clinical studies targeting the vasoconstrictor ET-1 pathway with receptor antagonists like bosentan and ambrisentan have shown strong results, even more optimism coming from macitentan, the newest drug."
Isn't transcription of eRNA bidirectional?,no,"In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), which codes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a well-known AR-regulated gene and its upstream enhancers produce bidirectional enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), termed KLK3e. The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone α-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity.  A richer picture has taken shape, integrating transcription of coding genes, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), and various other noncoding transcriptional events. In this review we give an overview of recent studies detailing the mechanisms of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II)-based transcriptional initiation and discuss the ways in which transcriptional direction is established as well as its functional implications. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone α-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity. Using this approach, we have defined a class of primary transcripts (eRNAs) that are transcribed uni- or bidirectionally from estrogen receptor binding sites (ERBSs) with an average transcription unit length of ∼3-5 kb. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. We identify 76 enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), 40 canonical lncRNAs, 65 antisense lncRNAs and 35 regions of bidirectional transcription (RBT) that are differentially expressed in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. Instead, communication between promoters and enhancers can be bidirectional with promoters required to activate enhancer transcription. A new paradigm has emerged in recent years characterizing transcription initiation as a bidirectional process encompassing a larger proportion of the genome than previously thought."
Has small pox been eradicated from the world?,yes,"small pox has been eradicated. smallpox is now eradicated In May 1980 the World Health Assembly in Geneva announced in solemn form the world-wide eradication of the small-pox and gave recommendations to the member countries for concluding measures concerning the small-pox vaccination, the foundation of vaccine reserves and the control of the epidemiological situation in the world. As a result of vaccination, diseases such as polio and measles have been controlled and small pox has been eradicated Small pox eradication from the world is the perfect example of the role of mass vaccination of the entire community of the universe.  The French owe a lot to this Central Committee of Vaccine, which greatly contributed to fighting small pox and eradicating the disease finally. Small pox eradication from the world is the perfect example of the role of mass vaccination of the entire community of the universe. Also, the vaccine that Jenner used, which decreased the prevalence of Small Pox worldwide in his own time, and later was used to eradicate Small Pox altogether, is discussed in light of recent data.. the only known cases of smallpox happened from an outbreak in Birmingham, England caused by a laboratory accident in the year of 1979. On May the 8 th 1980 the disease was declared as eliminated from the world by the WHO (WHO-Resolution 33.33)."
Don't have studies shown that there is no link between DNA methylation patterns and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?,yes,"Using pre-deployment SKA2 methylation levels and childhood trauma exposure, we found that the previously published suicide prediction rule significantly predicted post-deployment PTSD symptoms (AUC=0.66, 95% CI: 0.53-0.79) with an optimal sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.91. Permutation analysis using random methylation loci supported these findings. Together, these data establish the importance of SKA2 for cortisol stress responsivity and the development of PTSD and provide further evidence that SKA2 is a promising biomarker for stress-related disorders including PTSD.  Results provide novel support for PTSD-related accelerated aging in DNAm and extend the evidence base of known DNAm age correlates to the domains of neural integrity and cognition. We investigated serum DNA methylation patterns in genomic repetitive elements, LINE-1 and Alu, for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases and controls who were US military service members recently deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. In light of its role in glucocorticoid receptor transactivation, we investigated whether SKA2 DNA methylation influences cortisol stress reactivity and is involved in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These results suggest that alterations in global methylation pattern are involved in behavioural adaptation to environmental stress and pinpoint Dlgap2 as a possible target in PTSD. Here we examined whether there was a link between an established rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Bdnf DNA methylation We investigated serum DNA methylation patterns in genomic repetitive elements, LINE-1 and Alu, for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases and controls who were US military service members recently deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq.Cases (n = 75) had a postdeployment diagnosis of PTSD DNA methylation in repetitive elements and post-traumatic stress disorder: a case-control study of US military service members Here we examined whether there was a link between an established rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Bdnf DNA methylation.  DNA methylation in repetitive elements and post-traumatic stress disorder: a case-control study of US military service members. AIM: We investigated serum DNA methylation patterns in genomic repetitive elements, LINE-1 and Alu, for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases and controls who were US military service members recently deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq.  Together, these results suggest that psychosocial stress may alter global and gene-specific DNA methylation patterns potentially associated with peripheral immune dysregulation. DNA methylation in vulnerability to post-traumatic stress in rats: evidence for the role of the post-synaptic density protein Dlgap2. Subjects with PTSD showed a higher DNA methylation of four CpG sites at the BDNF promoter compared with those without PTSD Cumulatively, the data suggest that epigenetic variation at SKA2 mediates vulnerability to suicidal behaviors and PTSD through dysregulation of the HPA axis in response to stress."
Doesn't do physical activity influence gut hormones?,no,"Increases in blood PYY(3-36) levels were dependent on the exercise intensity (effect of session: P<0.001 by two-way ANOVA), whereas those in GLP-1 levels were similar between two different exercise sessions. A decrease in serum leptin levels (-48.4%, p < 0.001) was observed after intervention without changes in total peptide YY and insulin levels. ur data suggest that the control of spontaneous physical activity by gut hormones or their neuropeptide targets may represent an important mechanistic component of energy balance regulation Hunger and gut hormones remained unchanged during the bed rest. weight-bearing exercise has a greater exercise-induced appetite suppressive effect compared with non-weight-bearing exercise, and both forms of exercise lowered acylated ghrelin and increased total PYY, but the changes did not differ significantly between exercise modes. Appetite (P < 0.0005) and acylated ghrelin (P < 0.002) were suppressed during exercise but more so during SIE. Peptide YY increased during exercise but most consistently during END (P < 0.05). Acylated ghrelin was lowest in the afternoon of SIE (P = 0.018) despite elevated appetite Following the pre-exercise meal, ghrelin was suppressed ~17% and insulin and PYY were elevated ~157 and ~40%, respectively, relative to fasting (day 7). Following exercise, PYY, ghrelin, and GH were significantly (p < 0.0001) increased by ~11, ~16 and ~813%, respectively. The noted disruption in the typical inverse relationship between ghrelin and PYY following exercise suggests that interaction of these peptides may be at least partially responsible for post-exercise appetite suppression Plasma levels of PYY and GLP-1 were increased by exercise, whereas plasma ghrelin levels were unaffected by exercise These findings suggest ghrelin and PYY may regulate appetite during and after exercise, significant (P < 0.05) interaction effects for hunger, acylated ghrelin, and PYY, indicating suppressed hunger and acylated ghrelin during aerobic and resistance exercise and increased PYY during aerobic exercise 'exercise-induced anorexia' may potentially be linked to increased PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels. Hunger scores and PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels showed an inverse temporal pattern during the 1-h exercise/control intervention Exercise significantly increased mean PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels, and this effect was maintained during the post-exercise period for GLP-1 and PP. No significant effect of exercise was observed on postprandial levels of ghrelin following blood donation the strenuous exercise resulted in a marked reduction in the plasma leptin We conclude that strenuous physical exercise; 1) fails to affect plasma leptin level but when performed after meal but not after blood withdrawal it results in an increase and fall in plasma leptin, and 2) the release of gut hormones (gastrin, CCK and PP) and stress hormones (norepinephrine, cortisol, GH) increase immediately after exercise independently of feeding or blood donation the unrestricted exercise group has a significantly elevated SRIF-LI concentration Exercise has recently been reported to influence ghrelin and PYY concentrations."
Do circRNAs remain untranslated?,no,"We demonstrate that the circular RNA circ-Foxo3 was highly expressed in non-cancer cells and were associated with cell cycle progression Ectopic expression of circ-Foxo3 repressed cell cycle progression by binding to the cell cycle proteins cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (also known as cell division protein kinase 2 or CDK2) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (or p21), resulting in the formation of a ternary complex. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that act by direct base pairing to target sites within untranslated regions of messenger RNAs. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. This study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a naturally expressed circRNA. Numerous circRNAs were specifically expressed at different lactation stages, and only 1,314 circRNAs were detected at both lactation stages. A significantly positive correlation was observed for the expression profiles of some circRNAs and their parent genes. The resulting circRNA can be translated to generate functional proteins. In total, 80 circRNAs were identified from these 4 genes; circRNAs from CSN1S1 had very high abundance, and 3 of them accounted for 36% of all the circRNAs expressed in the mammary gland on lactation d 90. A total of 4,804 and 4,048 circRNAs were identified in the cow mammary gland on d 90 and 250 postpartum, respectively, of which only 2,231 circRNAs were co-expressed at both lactation stages, suggesting high stage specificity in the circRNAs. Arraystar circRNA Microarray Technology (KANGCHEN, Shanghai, China) was used to analyze the differential expression of circRNAs. The aim of study was to identify circRNA expression in articular cartilage and to explore the function of chondrocyte extracellular matrix (ECM)-related circRNAs (circRNA-CER) in cartilage. We also validated that P. falciparum produces circRNAs, which is notable given the lack of RNA interference in the organism, and discovered that a highly expressed, five-exon antisense RNA is poised to regulate P. falciparum gametocyte development 1 (PfGDV1), a gene required for early sexual commitment events. CircRNA expression pattern and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. CircRNAs are abundantly expressed also in the hematopoietic compartment."
Has the presence of delayed enhancement been documented in athletes performing strenuous exercise?,yes,"Atypical findings such as marked cardiac dilation, reduced deformation, or small patches of delayed gadolinium enhancement may be commonly encountered in well-trained athletes, but, at present, the prognostic significance of such findings is unknown.  On CMR, DGE localized to the interventricular septum was identified in 5 of 39 athletes who had greater cumulative exercise exposure and lower RVEF (47.1 ± 5.9 vs. 51.1 ± 3.7%, P = 0.042) than those with normal CMR. Post-event cardiac MRI demonstrated the interval appearance of delayed enhancement of gadolinium at the inferior insertion of the right ventricle and in the interventricular septum-a novel finding that may represent subtle inflammation secondary to a combined exercise and altitude effect. No evidence of delayed enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium was found on CMR imaging, suggesting that the increase in cardiac biomarkers after the marathon may not have be due to myocardial necrosis. Of the 102 runners, five had a CAD pattern of LGE, and seven had a non-CAD pattern of LGE. The CAD pattern of LGE was located in the territory of the left anterior descending coronary artery more frequently than was the non-CAD pattern (P = .0027, Fisher exact test). The prevalence of LGE in runners was higher than that in age-matched control subjects (12% vs 4%; P = .077, McNemar exact test)."
Don't patients with Pendred syndrome present congenital deafness?,no,"Pendred Syndrome can be characterized by the triad composed of familial goitre, abnormal perchlorate discharge and congenital deafness. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter.  Pendred syndrome comprises congenital sensorineural hearing loss, thyroid goiter, and positive perchlorate discharge test.  The cause of the congenital deafness in Pendred syndrome is obscure, although a Mondini type malformation of the cochlea exists in some patients. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter. Pendred syndrome is the autosomal recessively transmitted association of familial goiter and congenital deafness. Pendred syndrome (PDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness, goiter and iodide organification defect. Pendred syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder with the hallmark features of congenital deafness and thyroid goitre. Pendred syndrome, a common autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter, is caused by mutations of SLC26A4, which codes for pendrin. These studies provide compelling evidence that defects in pendrin cause Pendred syndrome thereby launching a new area of investigation into thyroid physiology, the pathogenesis of congenital deafness and the role of altered sulphate transport in human disease. Mutations in the Pendred syndrome gene have been observed in patients with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation, in the absence of other Pendred syndrome features. The occurrence of congenital deafness, mutism and goitre unassociated with cretinism or mental retardation in euthyroid patients is known as Pendred's Syndrome. The autosomal recessive Pendred's syndrome is defined by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. Pendred's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by goiter, impaired iodide organification, and congenital sensorineural deafness. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. Pendred's syndrome is manifested by congenital sensorineural deafness in association with familial goiter due to defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. Although the textbook view of the Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterised by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all patients present this classical clinical description. Pendred's syndrome may account for up to 10% of the cases with hereditary hearing loss, and pendrin mutations have also been found in a kindred with non-syndromic deafness. Pendred syndrome comprises the association of severe congenital sensorineural deafness with thyroid pathology. The first one is named Pendred Syndrome (PS) when deafness is associated with thyroid goiter; the second is called DFNB4, when no other symptoms are present. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, a partial defect in iodide organification, and dyshormonogenetic goiter. Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic recessive deafness associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (NSRD with EVA) are caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 (PDS) gene. Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture.  The occurrence of congenital deafness, mutism and goitre unassociated with cretinism or mental retardation in euthyroid patients is known as Pendred's Syndrome.  The cause of the congenital deafness in Pendred syndrome is obscure, although a Mondini type malformation of the cochlea exists in some patients.  The discovery of mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in patients with Pendred syndrome (congenital deafness, goiter, and defective iodide organification) suggested a possible role for the encoded protein, pendrin, as an apical iodide transporter.  Pendred syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder with the hallmark features of congenital deafness and thyroid goitre.  Pendred&apos;s syndrome is manifested by congenital sensorineural deafness in association with familial goiter due to defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. The majority of patients with Pendred&apos;s syndrome are euthyroid. We report on an unusual case of a patient with Pendred&apos;s syndrome presenting with amenorrhea and late-onset hypothyroidism.  Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome. The occurrence of congenital deafness, mutism and goitre unassociated with cretinism or mental retardation in euthyroid patients is known as Pendred&apos;s Syndrome. It has been estimated that 4-10 % of children with congenital deafness suffer from this condition. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome. Since this is the most common radiological malformation of the cochlea in deaf patients, we investigated what proportion of such cases were due to mutation of the PDS gene. Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome."
Is muscle lim protein (MLP) involved in cardiomyopathies?,yes,"Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease. In line with this notion, the homozygous loss of MLP results in cardiac hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Moreover, MLP is induced in several models of cardiac hypertrophy such as aortic banding and myocardial infarction.  Muscle LIM protein (MLP) null mice are often used as a model for human dilated cardiomyopathy. A lack of MLP leads to an age-dependent impairment of excitation-contraction coupling with resulting contractile dysfunction and secondary fibrosis. Loss of murine MLP results in dilated cardiomyopathy, and mutations in human MLP lead to cardiac hypertrophy, indicating a critical role for MLP in maintaining normal cardiac function. Our data indicate that MLP contributes to muscle stiffness and is necessary for maximum work and power generation. Interestingly, MLP was also found to be down-regulated in humans with heart failure (Zolk et al. Circulation 101:2674-2677, 2000) and MLP mutations are able to cause hypertrophic and dilated forms of cardiomyopathy in humans (Bos et al. Mol Genet Metab 88:78-85, 2006; Geier et al. Circulation 107:1390-1395, 2003; Hershberger et al. Clin Transl Sci 1:21-26, 2008; Knöll et al. Cell 111:943-955, 2002; Knöll et al. Circ Res 106:695-704, 2010; Mohapatra et al. Mol Genet Metab 80:207-215, 2003). MLP soon became an important model for experimental cardiology when it was first demonstrated that MLP deficiency leads to myocardial hypertrophy followed by a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure phenotype (Arber et al. Cell 88:393-403, 1997).  Previous studies have shown an association between CSRP3 missense mutations and either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or HCM, but all these studies were unable to provide comprehensive genetic evidence for a causative role of CSRP3 mutations.  We used a newly designed monoclonal antibody to show that muscle LIM protein (MLP), the protein encoded by CSRP3, is mainly a cytosolic component of cardiomyocytes and not tightly anchored to sarcomeric structures. Our functional data from both in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that at least one of MLP's mutated forms seems to be destabilized in the heart of HCM patients harbouring a CSRP3 missense mutation. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a cytoskeletal protein located at the Z-disc of sarcomeres. Mutations in the human MLP gene are associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. Our data demonstrate that Mlp84B is essential for normal cardiac function and establish the Drosophila model for the investigation of the mechanisms connecting defective cardiac Z-disc components to the development of cardiomyopathy. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a cytoskeletal LIM-only protein expressed in striated muscle. Mutations in human MLP are associated with cardiomyopathy; TTN-encoded titin, CSRP3-encoded muscle LIM protein, and TCAP-encoded telethonin are Z-disc proteins essential for the structural organization of the cardiac sarcomere and the cardiomyocyte's stretch sensor. All three genes have been established as cardiomyopathy-associated genes for both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  Approximately 4.1% of unrelated patients had HCM-associated MLP or TCAP mutations. MLP/TCAP-HCM phenotypically mirrors myofilament-HCM and is more severe than the subset of patients who still remain without a disease-causing mutation. The precise role of W4R-MLP in the pathogenesis of either DCM or HCM warrants further investigation. MLP (muscle-LIM-protein) deficient mice develop DCM and changes in the mechanical coupling of cardiomyocytes result in alterations at the intercalated disks and enhanced accumulation of adherens junction proteins. Targeted deletion of cytoskeletal muscle LIM protein (MLP) in mice consistently leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) after one or more months.  In summary, young MLPKO mice revealed substantial alterations in passive myocardial properties and relaxation time, but not in most systolic characteristics. These results indicate that the progression to heart failure in the MLPKO model may be driven by diastolic myocardial dysfunction and abnormal passive properties rather than systolic dysfunction. Mice lacking the muscle LIM protein (MLP) develop morphological and clinical signs resembling human dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Our results show that the absence of MLP causes a local loss of mitochondria. We hypothesize that this is caused by a disturbed interaction between cytoskeleton and mitochondria, which interferes with energy sensing and energy transfer. Recovery of energy depletion by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis might be a useful therapeutic strategy for improving the energy imbalance in heart failure. Previous work has shown that mutations in muscle LIM protein (MLP) can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In order to gain an insight into the molecular basis of the disease phenotype, we analysed the binding characteristics of wild-type MLP and of the (C58G) mutant MLP that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The molecular basis for HCM-causing mutations in the MLP gene might therefore be an alteration in the equilibrium of interactions of the ternary complex MLP-N-RAP-alpha-actinin. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a member of the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family and has been implicated in both myogenesis and sarcomere assembly. In the latter role, it binds zyxin and alpha-actinin, both of which are involved in actin organization. An MLP-deficient mouse has been described; these mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. We identified a patient with DCM and EFE, having a mutation in MLP with the residue lysine 69 substituted by arginine (K69R).  MLP-knockout mice develop a marked cardiac hypertrophy reaction and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MLP is therefore a candidate gene for heritable forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and DCM in humans. Family studies revealed cosegregation of clinically affected individuals with the respective mutations in MLP. CONCLUSION: Here, we present evidence that mutations in the CRP3/MLP gene can cause HCM. The skeletal muscle LIM protein 1 (SLIM1) is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and its expression is downregulated significantly in dilated human cardiomyopathy.  Targeted disruption of muscle LIM protein (MLP) has previously been shown to result in dilated cardiomyopathy with many of the clinical signs of heart failure, although the effects of MLP disruption on passive ventricular mechanics and myocyte architecture are not known. These results suggest that the disruption of the cytoskeletal protein MLP results in less compliant passive tissue and concomitant structural alterations in the three-dimensional myocyte architecture that may in part explain the ventricular dysfunction in the dilated heart.  Mutations in cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3), the gene encoding MLP, have been directly associated with human cardiomyopathies, whereas aberrant expression patterns are reported in human cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease. Previous work has shown that mutations in muscle LIM protein (MLP) can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)"
Isn't cytisine superior to nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation?,no,"The effectiveness of cytisine for continuous abstinence was superior to that of nicotine-replacement therapy at 1 week, 2 months, and 6 months. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary outcome, cytisine was superior to nicotine-replacement therapy among women and noninferior among men. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with brief behavioral support, cytisine was found to be superior to nicotine-replacement therapy in helping smokers quit smoking, but it was associated with a higher frequency of self-reported adverse events."
Isn't it safe to take isotretinoin during pregnancy?,yes,"Isotretinoin is a remarkably effective drug for severe, recalcitrant acne vulgaris. a number of important adverse effects were reported even the most recent pregnancy prevention program (iPledge) is no more successful than prior programs; there will likely always be a small number of female patients becoming pregnant while receiving isotretinoin for acne vulgaris. Isotretinoin has revolutionized the management of acne vulgaris. The adverse effect(s) that led to patients stopping isotretinoin were cheilitis (22 patients), mood change (13), tiredness (12), eczema (6) and pregnancy (2). Downregulation of FGFR2b-signaling by isotretinoin explains its therapeutic effect in acne. Downregulation of FGFR2b-signaling during the first trimester of pregnancy disturbs branched morphogenesis and explains retinoid embryotoxicity. The isotretinoin, a 13-cis-retinoic acid, has revolutionized the management of severe treatment-resistant acne and it has been widely used for a range of dermatological conditions, in 90% of the time in young women between 13 and 45 years of age. This agent has severe teratogenic effects, as serious craniofacial, cardiovascular, thymic and central nervous system malformations. malformations is 3-5%, but it increases to almost 30% in women exposed to isotretinoin during the first trimester of pregnancy. Generally, patients in treatment with isotretinoin avoid eventual pregnancy during assumption and, after its stopping, fertility and foetal development are normal once circulating isotretinoin levels return to normal. After 3 months of pharmacological wash out, patient become pregnant and manifested this severe malformation. Woman interrupted gestation, by labour induction. Clindamycin phosphate 1.2% together with tretinoin 0.025% as a gel (CTG) is a topical formulation of a fixed and stable combination approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age or older. Safety of CTG use in pregnancy has not been established. To estimate the population-based incidence rates of pregnancy, spontaneous and elective abortions, and birth defects associated with isotretinoin use, and to determine predictors of pregnancy while on isotretinoin Pregnancies, spontaneous and elective abortions, and birth defects were identified using procedure codes and medical diagnoses. 90 women who became pregnant while on the drug, 76 terminated the pregnancy (84%), three had a spontaneous abortion (3%), two had trauma during delivery resulting in neonatal deaths (2%) and nine had a live birth (10%). Among the live births, only one had a congenital anomaly of the face and neck (11%). elective abortion rates were also much higher in our study. Topical antibiotics, isotretinoin or systemic antibiotics are usually used for acne therapy. However, isotretinoin cannot be used during pregnancy because it can cause significant birth defects while systemic antibiotics can have adverse side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation, photosensitivity and tetracycline sensitivity. Isotretinoin has been used to treat acne since 1982. Its current indications in the package insert are limited and many physicians still feel uncomfortable prescribing it because of its side effects. Aside from its teratogenic effect, isotretinoin is a safe and excellent drug for acne therapy. I a pregnancy test in females. Vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoic acid, tretinoin and isotretinoin, are currently used in dermatological treatments. The administration of high doses of this vitamin provokes congenital malformations in mice: cleft palate, maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia and total or partial fusion of the maxillary incisors. Twelve 60-day-old female Mus musculus were divided into two groups on the 7th day of pregnancy: treated group--1 mg isotretinoin per kg body weight, dissolved in vegetable oil, was administered from the 7th to the 13th day of pregnancy; control group--vegetable oil in equivalent volume was administered orally for the same period. On the 16th day of pregnancy, the females were sacrificed, the fetuses were removed and their heads amputated. The results showed that both groups had closed palates with no reminiscence of epithelial cells; however, the first molar germs of the isotretinoin-treated animals showed delayed development compared to the control animals. Isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) is teratogenic in all species examined; based on administered dose, humans appear most sensitive, followed by (in order or decreasing sensitivity) monkey, rabbit, hamster, mouse, and rat. Based on embryonic delivered dose, we suggest that 13-cis-RA is an equipotent teratogen in hamster and rabbit. its safety in humans is occasionally questioned because oral ingestion of retinoids at therapeutic levels is known to entail teratogenic risks. topical tretinoin is not a potential human developmental toxicant. Teratogenicity of vitamin A was firstly detected in experimental animals in 1953. Nearly 30 years later, teratogenicity of vitamin A analogue-isotretinoin was reported in humans. Isotretinoin induces serious birth defects of craniofacial and central nervous system, cardiovascular system and thymic malformations--in about 25% of babies exposed during the first trimester of their prenatal development. high vitamin A intake in pregnant woman: Women who use daily vitamin A supplements during early pregnancy have approximately a two-fold increased risk of giving birth to a malformed baby. Vitamin A started to affect development between doses 0.3-0.3 microm [corrected] per embryo. Malformations of head, extremities and heart were detected similarly like in laboratory mammals and in man the minimal embryotoxic doses of vitamin A in mammals were estimated to be between 0.1-1 mg/kg of maternal weight Human epidemiological studies have proved teratogenicity of vitamin A after daily doses 25,000 i.u.-8.3 mg (0.13 mg/kg)- and reduction of its maximum intake has been recommended to 10,000 i.u. per day (0.05 mg/kg). The results about teratogenicity of vitamin A achieved in the chick embryo are in agreement with such a recommendation. Intake of vitamin A in the food is sufficient for pregnant woman in common Czech population. Therefore, an artificial supplementation of vitamin A brings risk of overdosage. If supplementation by vitamin A is unavoidable during pregnancy, B-carotene should be preferred. a teratogenic dosing regimen with 13-cis-RA [Hummler et al. (1994) Teratology 50:184-193]. plasma AUC values of all-trans-RA were 2- to 7-fold higher after all-trans-RA administration (present study) than after dosing with the teratogenic dose of 13-cis-RA. These results strengthen our recent suggestion that the teratogenic effects induced in cynomolgus monkeys by 13-cis-RA treatment cannot solely result from the action of all-trans-RA, but may involve 13-cis-RA and 13-cis-4-oxo-RA, which could act directly or function as transport vehicle. VITA, among others, is involved in the process of morphogenesis. In contrast, synthetic derivatives of VITA, specifically Tigasone (etretinate, TIG) and Roaccutane (isotretinoin, ROA), are regarded as major teratogens. A biphasic maximal inhibition was present at 1 microM concentrations when the retinoids VITA, TIG and ROA were added for 16 h (52, 58 and 57%, respectively; P < 0.01 by one-way analysis of variance). In contrast, the addition of the three retinoids at 1 microM concentrations for 16 h had no significant effect on HCG secretion by placental explants of 11-13 weeks gestational age. Inhibition of HCG secretion by retinoids may contribute either directly or indirectly to their teratogenicity. Isotretinoin is a potent retinoic acid used in the treatment of skin disorders. Though very effective, it is teratogenic if administered during pregnancy, and its teratogenic effect may be related to the normal activity of retinoids as signalling molecules in the embryo. defects that includes heart defects, by inhibiting the migration of neural crest cells. Proliferation in heart tissue of whole embryo cultures was inhibited in medium with 10(-6) M isotretinoin to 62% of the control level in myocardium. The results suggest multiple effects of retinoids on growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation of early cardiac tissue, and are discussed in relation to the potential role of retinoids in early embryogenesis. Oral administration of 400 mg/kg of 13-cis retinoic acid to 9 day pregnant mice gives rise to important maxillofacial malformations. The first manifestation of teratogenic effect is an increase of density of cell death arising in the dorsal part of the first two branchial arches at day 9.5. These two arches become hypoplastic at days 10 and 11, and the preskeletal anlagen appear too late in comparison to control embryos. Meckel's cartilage is too curvilinear and medially situated. Pre-ossicular and pre-mandibular blastemata develop with spatial distortions which are well analyzable at days 16 and 17 Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, Accutane) increases the risk of major congenital malformations in infants exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. However, there have been no epidemiologic reports to date on the effect of a subsequent pregnancy after discontinuation of isotretinoin. analysis of pregnancy case reports from patients in whom conception occurred after isotretinoin treatment had been discontinued spontaneous and missed abortions from all pregnancies was 9.1% (eight patients), and the incidence rate of congenital malformation among the live births was 5.0% (four patients). were not significantly different from the rates reported for women of reproductive age in the general population. In addition, the malformations reported were not characteristic of retinoic acid-induced congenital anomalies. Keratolenticular dysgenesis (Peters' anomaly) was induced in mice by exposure to the human teratogens, ethanol or 13-cis retinoic acid (isotretinoin, Accutane). Acute teratogen exposure on the seventh day of gestation (corresponding to the third week of human gestation) resulted in an eye malformation incidence of 46% to 100% in day 14 fetuses This secondary effect on neural crest derivatives is exhibited in the adult animals as corneal opacities associated with defects in Descemet's membrane and endothelium, and anterior polar cataracts. 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA, or isotretinoin) is responsible for various craniofacial malformations in the rodent and human embryo. In whole embryo culture, 13-cis-RA caused significant overall embryonic growth retardation, especially in the primary and secondary palatal processes. subsequent cell growth was decreased at concentrations of 13-cis-RA greater than 1 X 10(-5) M. After a 40-hr treatment period, labeling indices in retinoid-treated cells were significantly lower than control values (25% compared with 40%). Retinoic acid also caused a significant, concentration-dependent decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation. The inhibitory effect of 13-cis-RA on proliferation of oral-nasal mesenchymal cells appears to be related to the production of craniofacial malformations. Reports of adverse human pregnancy outcomes including cleft palate have increased as the clinical use of isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) and other retinoic acid (RA) derivatives have increased, but the mechanisms by which their effects are exerted are not understood. In shelves exposed to EGF and trans-RA early in their development, DNA synthesis appears to terminate prematurely as compared to shelves cultured in control media, and this effect is accompanied by excessive mesenchymal extracellular space expansion. Exposure of shelves to EGF alone is sufficient to block degeneration and induce hyperplasia of the medial epithelial cells but does not induce other ultrastructural changes seen with both EGF and RA. The observed alterations in medial cell morphology could interfere with adhesion of the palatal shelves and may play a role in retinoid-induced cleft palate in the human embryo. Recent clinical observations strongly suggest that isotretinoin [13-cis-retinoic acid (cis RA)] is a human teratogen causing primarily heart and craniofacial malformations including ear and palatal defects. Our results demonstrate that labeled cis RA enters the tissues of the embryo both in vivo and in vitro. Cis RA inhibited proliferation of the frontonasal mesenchyme cells in primary culture with 31% inhibition occurring at 2 X 10(-5) M cis RA. Retinoic acid, an analogue of vitamin A, is known to be teratogenic in laboratory animals and has recently been implicated in a few clinical case reports. To study the human teratogenicity of this agent, we investigated 154 human pregnancies with fetal exposure to isotretinoin, a retinoid prescribed for severe recalcitrant cystic acne. The outcomes were 95 elective abortions, 26 infants without major malformations, 12 spontaneous abortions, and 21 malformed infants. A subset of 36 of the 154 pregnancies was observed prospectively. Exposure to isotretinoin was associated with an unusually high relative risk for a group of selected major malformations (relative risk = 25.6; 95 per cent confidence interval, 11.4 to 57.5). It is possible that a major mechanism of isotretinoin teratogenesis is a deleterious effect on cephalic neural-crest cell activity that results in the observed craniofacial, cardiac, and thymic malformations."
Can Pentraxin 3 predict outcomes of sepsis?,yes,"As compared with low serum PTX3and sTWEAK cases, cirrhotic patients with high serum PTX3/sTWEAK levels a have higher probability of new severe infections, severe sepsis, septic shock, type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, in-hospital, and 3-month follow-up mortalities.  Neonates with high nPTX3 concentrations also have lowered APGAR scores, increased rate of respiratory distress syndrome, clinical sepsis, IVH, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged NICU stay. In terms of predicting the prognosis of sepsis with heart failure complications, the PTX3 value's area under ROC curve was larger than that of BNP (respectively 0. 844, 0. 472).CONCLUSION: The PTX3 is an objective biochemical marker in diagnosis of sepsis; it is helpful in assessment of severity and prognosis of sepsis; it also has a certain clinical value in the assessment of sepsis cardiovascular function damage. Severe Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis is associated with elevation of pentraxin 3. Together, these results suggest that elevation of PTX3 is associated with fulminant disease during A. baumannii sepsis. Persisting high levels of plasma pentraxin 3 over the first days after severe sepsis and septic shock onset are associated with mortality. PTX3, as a mediator of inflammation, may represent an early marker of severity and outcome in sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Persisting high levels of circulating PTX3 over the first days from sepsis onset may be associated with mortality. PTX3 correlates with severity of sepsis and with sepsis-associated coagulation/fibrinolysis dysfunction. Pentraxin 3 in patients with severe sepsis or shock: the ALBIOS trial. Pentraxin 3: an immune modulator of infection and useful marker for disease severity assessment in sepsis. Redox state of pentraxin 3 as a novel biomarker for resolution of inflammation and survival in sepsis. The prototypic long pentraxin, pentraxin 3, is an acute phase protein that is structurally related but distinct from C-reactive protein which has proven to correlate with the severity of bacterial infection in critically ill patients. Circulating levels of the long pentraxin PTX3 correlate with severity of infection in critically ill patients. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is associated with severe sepsis and fatal disease in emergency room patients with suspected infection: a prospective cohort study. In addition, high levels of PTX3 were associated with unfavorable outcome.CONCLUSIONS: The long pentraxin PTX3 is elevated in critically ill patients and correlates with severity of disease and infection. PTX3, as a mediator of inflammation, may represent an early marker of severity and outcome in sepsis. Redox state of pentraxin 3 as a novel biomarker for resolution of inflammation and survival in sepsis.

Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is associated with severe sepsis and fatal disease in emergency room patients with suspected infection: a prospective cohort study. The proteomic profile of circulating pentraxin 3 (PTX3) complex in sepsis demonstrates the interaction with azurocidin 1 and other components of neutrophil extracellular traps."
Aren't there transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes?,no,"Transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes. Despite the presence of over 3 million transposons separated on average by approximately 500 bp, the human and mouse genomes each contain almost 1000 transposon-free regions (TFRs) over 10 kb in length. The majority of human TFRs correlate with orthologous TFRs in the mouse, despite the fact that most transposons are lineage specific. Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation. All three elements insert only rarely within many Polycomb-regulated regions, a property that may contribute to the origin of ""transposon-free regions"" (TFRs) in metazoan genomes. Despite the presence of over 3 million transposons separated on average by approximately 500 bp, the human and mouse genomes each contain almost 1000 transposon-free regions (TFRs) over 10 kb in length. RESULTS: Here we report that transposon-free regions (TFRs) are prominent genomic features of amphibian and fish lineages, and that many have been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution, although most transposon-derived sequences have entered these lineages after their divergence.

Can valproic acid act as an activator of AMPK?,yes,"Here we demonstrate that VPA is a novel activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular metabolism, using primary mouse and human hepatocytes. These studies are the first to establish VPA and its metabolites as in vitro activators of AMPK."
Is there any software for automated analysis of immuno-histochemistry images?,yes,"The LIM homeobox gene Lhx2 is expressed in cortical progenitors during development and also in the superficial layers of the neocortex in maturity. However, analysis of Lhx2 function at later stages of cortical development has been hampered by severe phenotypes associated with early loss of function.  The vein graft samples were obtained on each time point after surgery. The expression of the EDRz transfected in the vein graft was detected using a fluorescent microscope. Early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) mRNA was measured using reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization. And the protein expression of Egr-1 was detected by using western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme, which amongst other functions, is involved in cell differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TG2 contributes to differentiation of OPCs into OLGs and thereby stimulates remyelination."
Isn't the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for Rheumatoid Arthritis?,no,"Combined longitudinal analysis of the 2 cohorts suggests further association of several loci with Larsen score (KIF5A, PTPN22, AFF3, TAGAP) and therefore a significant accumulation of RA severity markers among RA susceptibility markers (p = 0.016) A non-intronic marker at TNFAIP3, GIN1/C5orf30, STAT4, ANKRD55/IL6ST, BLK and PTPN22 showed association with RA susceptibility, irrespective of the serological status, the latter three markers remaining significantly associated with anti-CCP negative RA, after correction for multiple testing A C-to-T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 1858 of human PTPN22 cDNA and converting an arginine (R620) to tryptophan (W620) confers the highest risk of rheumatoid arthritis among non-HLA genetic variations that are known to be associated with this disease In addition, how the overall activity of PTPN22 is regulated and how the R-to-W conversion contributes to rheumatoid arthritis is still poorly understood Our data depict a model that can reconcile the conflicting observations on the functional impact of the C1858T SNP and also suggest that PTPN22.6 is a novel biomarker of rheumatoid arthritis. Lack of association of common variants in PTPN22 with RA in Han Chinese was confirmed This study identifies MMEL1 and CTLA4 as RA susceptibility genes, provides suggestive evidence of association for a further six loci in the Han Chinese population and confirms lack of PTPN22 association in Asian populations PTPN22 R620W genotype-phenotype correlation analysis and gene-environment interaction study in early rheumatoid arthritis: results from the ESPOIR cohort  PTPN22 620W risk allele was associated with ACPA production [odds ratio (OR) = 2.21, 95% CI 1.4, 3.4, P < 0.0001] Hormonal treatment exposition and smoking were found to act with a protective effect against ACPA production (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.3, 0.7, P = 0.001) and early bone erosion (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.4-0.8, P = 0.003), respectively, and independently of HLADR and PTPN22 status  RA patients (n=333) and controls (n=490) from the Cree/Ojibway NAN population in Central Canada were HLA-DRB1 typed and tested for 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have previously been associated with RA, including PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, CTLA4, PADI4, STAT4, FCRL3, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, KIF5A-PIP4K2C, IL2RB, TNFAIP3, IL10-1082G/A and REL Several other genes, including PTPN22 and PADI4, show modest association with RA Other variants in potentially pathogenic genes located in non-MHC regions have been implicated by recently performed genome wide analysis studies. These genes include PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, PADI4, STAT4 Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance. HLA-DRB1 and the R620W single-nucleotide polymorphism of PTPN22 were genotyped In addition, evidence of a significant interaction between the shared epitope and the risk allele of PTPN22 was observed only in these patients Although SNPs in PADI4 had similar allele frequency among three groups [maximal difference 11%; (P >0.05)], the other three loci revealed statistically significant allele frequency differences (maximal difference 39% (P <0.00001), 13% (P <0.00001), and 8% (P <0.00001) in SLC22A4, PDCD1, and PTPN22, respectively) Several multiple, large-scale, genetic studies on autoimmune-disease-associated SNPs have been reported recently: peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); solute carrier family 22 members 4 and 5 (SLC22A4 and 5) in RA and Crohn's disease (CD); programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and RA; and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) in T1D, RA, and SLE  Recently a number of convincing candidate genes have begun to emerge and an update has been provided for three of these: PTPN22, CTLA-4 and MIF. Association studies support a role for several genes, including TNFR2, PADI4, SLC22A4, RUNX1, and PTPN22 Analyses of families with multiple autoimmune disorders have revealed a functional polymorphism, 620W, in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPN22 as a predisposing factor for type 1 diabetes, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, and the presence of the PTPN22 protein appears to herald the development of autoantibodies in these disorders Replication of putative candidate-gene associations with rheumatoid arthritis in >4,000 samples from North America and Sweden: association of susceptibility with PTPN22, CTLA4, and PADI4. We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P=.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples.  Exploration of our data set with clinically relevant subsets of RA reveals that PTPN22 is associated with an earlier age at disease onset (P=.004) and that PTPN22 has a stronger effect in males than in females (P=.03)  Given the strong statistical power to replicate a true-positive association in this study, our results provide support for PTPN22, CTLA4, and PADI4 as RA susceptibility genes and demonstrate novel associations with clinically relevant subsets of RA In logistic regression analysis, ACPA predicted RA-development independent of PTPN22, while the PTPN22 polymorphism had no independent effect. Risk of progression from undifferentiated arthritis to rheumatoid arthritis: the effect of the PTPN22 1858T-allele in anti-citrullinated peptide antibody positive patients Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and the C1858T missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PTPN22 gene are both associated with the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Associations between human leukocyte antigen, PTPN22, CTLA4 genotypes and rheumatoid arthritis phenotypes of autoantibody status, age at diagnosis and erosions in a large cohort study HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (HLA-SE), PTPN22 and CTLA4 alleles are associated with cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Auto-antibodies, HLA and PTPN22: susceptibility markers for rheumatoid arthritis The combination of the PTPN22 1858T variant and anti-CCP antibodies gave a high specificity for the disease, and was significantly associated with RA (P = 8.86 x 10(-5), OR 10.05, 95% CI 1.88-53.73) The combination of the T variant of the 1858 polymorphism of the PTPN22 gene in combination with the presence of anti-CCP antibodies, preferentially in a SE-positive individual, is associated with the development of RA No association of the PTPN22 gene with mortality was detected Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association of the HLA-DRB1 (including the shared epitope [SE]) and PTPN22 genes with the risk of death from all causes and from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to assess the interactions between SE, smoking, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) status, adjusted by age at symptom onset and sex The disease association of the common 1858C>T Arg620Trp (rs2476601) nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of protein tyrosine phosphatase; nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) on chromosome 1p13 has been confirmed in type 1 diabetes and also in other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and Graves' disease To evaluate the predictive values for disease progression of various antibodies against citrullinated peptide proteins (ACPA) and their relation to PTPN22 1858C/T polymorphism and HLA-DRB1 alleles in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) PTPN22, PADI-4, and CTLA-4 have been associated with risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) A significant multiplicative interaction between PTPN22 and smoking for more than 10 pack-years was observed (P = 0.04) No gene-gene interaction was observed between PTPN22 and HLA-SE After adjusting for smoking and reproductive factors, PTPN22 was associated with RA risk among Caucasian women in these cohorts. We found both additive and multiplicative interactions between PTPN22 and heavy cigarette smoking. Weak evidence for an effect at the PTPN22 locus was also observed Association of the PTPN22 gene (-1123G > C) polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese patients These data suggest, the CC genotype and C allele of the -1123G > C in the PTPN22 gene are associated with an increased risk for RA in Chinese population Therefore, the CC genotype and C allele of the -1123G > C in the PTPN22 gene may be used as a genetic marker for the predisposition of RA in Chines A longer duration of breastfeeding increased the risk of developing RA, especially among individuals seropositive for ACPA or IgM-RF or carrying the PTPN22 1858T variant In a multiple logistic regression analysis, increasing time of breastfeeding (OR 9.5, 95% CI 2.14-42.43 for ≥ 17 months), seropositivity for ACPAs (OR 19.5, 95% CI 4.47-84.81), and carriage of the PTPN22 1858T variant (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.36-7.54) remained significant predictors of RA After quality control, 3209 patients and 3692 controls were included in the study. Eight markers (ie, rs1160542 (AFF3), rs1678542 (KIF5A), rs2476601 (PTPN22), rs3087243 (CTLA4), rs4810485 (CD40), rs5029937 (6q23), rs10760130 (TRAF1/C5) and rs7574865 (STAT4)) were significantly associated with RA by meta-analysis Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on RA identified known and novel susceptibility genes like HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1/C5, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, CD40, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, IL2RB, and KIF5A-PIP4K2C In the total RA inception cohort, the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, trend P < 0.0001), PTPN22 (per-allele OR = 1.5, trend P < 0.0001), OLIG3/TNFAIP3 locus (per-allele OR = 1.2, trend P = 0.009) and TRAF1/C5 locus (per-allele OR = 1.1, trend P = 0.04) were associated with RA Progress has been made in determining the relative contributions and the interaction of the shared epitope, PTPN22 and smoking in conferring the risk of anticitrullinated protein antibodies-positive and negative RA Homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the PTPN22 1858T allele had a decreased probability of remission Our analyses have confirmed previous findings for genes PTPN22 and C5 Fifty-five percent of the FDRs had > or =1 copy of the shared epitope, 20% had > or =1 copy of the PTPN22 polymorphism, and approximately 16% were positive for rheumatoid factor (RF; including isotypes) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody As an effect several new genes have been recognized as an HLA-independent genetic risk factors of RA. PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors, whereas STAT 4, CTLA4, PADI4 and IRF5 genes polymorphisms are listed among probable RA development genetic risk factors Patients were analysed for anti-MCV and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), and were genotyped for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 ""shared epitope"" (SE) and protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) 1858T As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA However, we were able to replicate the association signals between RA and HLA-DRB1 alleles, STAT4 (rs7574865), PTPN22 (rs2476601) and OLIG3/TNFAIP3 (rs10499194 and rs6920220) Additionally, SNPs rs7574865STAT4 (P = 9.2*10-6; OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.35 - 2.18) and rs2476601PTPN22 (P = 9.5*10-4; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.23 - 2.26) were associated with susceptibility to RA, whereas after permutation testing OLIG3/TNFAIP3 SNPs rs10499194 and rs6920220 missed our criteria for significance (Pcorr = 0.114 and Pcorr = 0.180, respectively In our Slovak population, HLA-DRB1 alleles as well as SNPs in STAT4 and PTPN22 genes showed a strong association with RA Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically Genetic markers such as shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T variant increase the relative risk for disease development Particularly, ACPAs in combination with human leukocyte antigen-shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T carriage increased the relative risks of developing RA compared with not having these factors However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA Functional polymorphisms of PTPN22 and FcgR genes in Tunisian patients with rheumatoid arthritis We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 620W allele and RA In conclusion, we have confirmed that PTPN22 620W allele is associated with Tunisian RA but does not constitute a factor influencing clinical manifestations The C1858T allele of the PTPN22 gene has been reported to confer risk for RA Similarly, the presence or absence of the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope or the RA-associated PTPN22 allele had no influence on this association Although some genetic risk factors for RA are well-established, most notably HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22, these markers do not fully account for the observed heritability Lastly, in combination with the other two known genetic risk factors, HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22, the variants reported here generate more than a 45-fold RA-risk differential Contribution of PTPN22 1858T, TNFRII 196R and HLA-shared epitope alleles with rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies to very early rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis PTPN22 1858T, TNFRII 196R and HLA-SE alleles do not improve the predictive value of RF and ACPA for RA diagnosis in our cohort, and do not contribute to an earlier diagnosis in undifferentiated patients initially negative for RF and ACPA"
Are optogenetics tools used in the study and treatment of epilepsy?,yes,"The emerging revolutionary technique of optogenetics enables manipulation of the activity of specific neuronal populations in vivo with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution using light. We used optogenetic approaches to test the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in the lithium-pilocarpine model of acute elicited seizures in awake behaving rats. This chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures. We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research. Optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy.  Therefore, one could optogenetically activate specific or a mixed population of interneurons and dissect their selective or concerted inhibitory action on principal cells. We chose to explore a conceptually novel strategy involving simultaneous activation of mixed populations of interneurons by optogenetics and study their impact on ongoing epileptiform activity in mouse acute hippocampal slices. Our data suggest that global optogenetic activation of mixed interneuron populations is a more effective approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, but the initial action potential generation in principal neurons needs to be taken in consideration. Recently, a number of experiments have explored the treatments for epilepsy with optogenetic control of neurons. Here, we discuss the possibility that an optogenetic approach could be used to control the release of gliotransmitters and improve astrocyte function such as glutamate and K(+) uptake, and thereby offer a potential strategy to investigate and treat astrocyte-related epilepsy. Optogenetic and designer receptor technologies provide unprecedented and much needed specificity, allowing for spatial, temporal and cell type-selective modulation of neuronal circuits. Using such tools, it is now possible to begin to address some of the fundamental unanswered questions in epilepsy, to dissect epileptic neuronal circuits and to develop new intervention strategies.  We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research. Moreover, optogenetics may be considered for developing potential treatment strategies for brain diseases, particularly for excitability disorders such as epilepsy. This chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures. How might novel technologies such as optogenetics lead to better treatments in epilepsy? WONOEP appraisal: optogenetic tools to suppress seizures and explore the mechanisms of epileptogenesis. Finally, optogenetic tools allow rapid and reversible suppression of epileptic electroencephalography (EEG) activity upon photoactivation. Our data suggest that epileptiform activity in the hippocampus caused by impaired inhibition may be controlled by optogenetic silencing of principal neurons and potentially can be developed as an alternative treatment for epilepsy. Seizure suppression by high frequency optogenetic stimulation using in vitro and in vivo animal models of epilepsy. Optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy.  We first discuss the benefits and caveats to using optogenetic approaches and recent advances in optogenetics related tools. We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research."
Is there an association between bruxism and reflux,yes,"Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, no robust evidence supports the association between SB and GERD. Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. Our large-scale cross-sectional study found that problem behaviors in adolescents were associated with sleep problems, including sleep bruxism, as well as lifestyle and food habits and GERD symptoms. The frequencies of EMG bursts, rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes, grinding noise, and the RMMA/microarousal ratio were significantly higher in the 20-minute period after acidic infusion than after saline infusion. RMMA episodes including SB were induced by esophageal acidification.

Association between nocturnal bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux. Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing."
Can sorafenib activate AMPK?,yes,"Here, we identify sorafenib as an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in a manner that involves either upstream LKB1 or CAMKK2.  Persistent activation of AMPK by sorafenib finally led to the impairment of glucose metabolism both in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells as well as in the highly glycolytic MDA-MB-231 cells, resulting in cell death. Here, we identify sorafenib as an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in a manner that involves either upstream LKB1 or CAMKK2 Sorafenib synergizes with metformin in NSCLC through AMPK pathway activation. Persistent activation of AMPK by sorafenib finally led to the impairment of glucose metabolism both in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells as well as in the highly glycolytic MDA-MB-231 cells, resulting in cell death. This previously unrecognized long-term effect of sorafenib was mediated by AMPK-dependent inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway."

Does GATA-1 regulate ribosomal protein genes?,yes,"Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of GATA-1 and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, GATA-1s. These mutations have been found in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital erythroid aplasia typically caused by mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Sixteen of the corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1). Deletion of PKC1 relieves the repression of both ribosomal protein and rRNA genes that occurs in response to a defect in the secretory pathway. This stress is monitored by Pkc1p, which initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to repression of transcription of the rRNA and ribosomal protein genes. The importance of the transcription of the 137 ribosomal protein genes to the economy of the cell is apparent from the existence of at least three distinct pathways that can effect the repression of this set of genes."
Can cffDNA be used for non-invasive testing?,yes,"Non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal circulation The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible. In recent years, technical advances in the molecular analysis of fetal DNA (e.g., digital PCR and massively parallel sequencing (MPS)) has enabled the successful implementation of noninvasive testing into clinical practice, such as fetal sex assessment, RhD genotyping, and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection.With the ability to decipher the entire fetal genome from maternal plasma DNA, we foresee that an increased number of non-invasive prenatal tests will be available for detecting many single-gene disorders in the near future. This review briefly summarizes the technical aspects of the NIPT and application of NIPT in clinical practice. First identified in 1997, cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has just recently been used to detect fetal aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 18, and 21, showing its potential to revolutionize prenatal genetic testing as a non-invasive screening tool To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible The effectiveness and clinical utility of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was assessed by undertaking a prospective national audit of UK testing The recent release of new, non-invasive prenatal tests for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has been hailed as a revolution in prenatal testing and has triggered significant commercial interest in the field Non-invasive prenatal aneuploidy testing that utilizes cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in maternal blood is one example of an innovative technology that promises significant benefits for its intended end users; however, it is currently uncertain whether it will achieve widespread clinical implementation Analysis of cell free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma is used routinely for non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D status and some single gene disorders Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma is an alternative to invasive prenatal diagnosis (IPD), which carries a 1% risk of miscarriage.  The recent release of new, non-invasive prenatal tests for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has been hailed as a revolution in prenatal testing and has triggered significant commercial interest in the field.  The effectiveness and clinical utility of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was assessed by undertaking a prospective national audit of UK testing.  NIFTY (Non-invasive Fetal Trisomy Test) is a non-invasive prenatal test which is used for diagnosing fetal trisomy. The test is based on the analysis of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) present in the plasma and serum of a pregnant woman. Using non-invasive method of cffDNAs in the shortest time possible, as well as avoiding invasive tests for early determination of fetal gender, provides the opportunity of deciding and employing early treatment for fetuses at risk of genetic diseases. The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible. To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake. Nowadays, new advances in the use of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma of pregnant women has provided the possibility of applying cffDNA in prenatal diagnosis as a non-invasive method. Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women. Prevention of contamination following our anti-contamination criteria is a good practice for certain non-invasive sex determination, using cffDNA."
Can valproic acid prolong survival of glioblastoma patients?,yes,"For patients who presented with epilepsy, the use of the antiepileptic drug VPA did not associate with survival when compared with patients who did not receive VPA treatment. This prognostic effect is not solely explained by early diagnosis, and survival is not associated with VPA treatment. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have indicated that VPA has radiosensitizing effects for gliomas and radioprotective influence on normal brain tissue or hippocampal neurons. The results of several retrospective studies have also indicated potential benefit to improve survival of patients with GBM. Moreover, the promising treatment results of a phase 2 trial of concurrent radiation therapy, temozolomide, and VPA for patients with GBM have been recently reported.  While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients.  Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylase Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma. Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival. Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16.9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93).  Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylase. Several uncontrolled retrospective case series and a post hoc analysis of the registration trial for temozolomide indicated an association between valproic acid (VPA) use and improved survival outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.To confirm the hypothesis suggested above, a combined analysis of survival association of antiepileptic drug use at the start of chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide was performed in the pooled patient cohort (n = 1,869) of four contemporary randomized clinical trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma: AVAGlio (Avastin in Glioblastoma; NCT00943826), CENTRIC (Cilengitide, Temozolomide, and Radiation T Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients. Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16.9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93).VPA may be preferred over an EIAED in patients with glioblastoma who require an AED during TMZ-based chemoradiotherapy. The combination of radiotherapy, temozolomide and valproic acid (VPA) has shown some promise in retrospective analyses of patients with glioblastoma, although their mechanisms of action remain unknown.We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of pretreating glioma cells with temozolomide and VPA as an immunization strategy to boost an adaptive immune response in a syngeneic mouse model.Temozolomide and VPA induced autophagy in GL261 glioma cells, and caused tumor antigen-specific T-cells to become activated effector T-cells.

Isn't the protein KCNQ2 associated with idiopathic epilepsy?,no,"Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy (JIE) in Arabian foals resembles benign-familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC) syndrome, a rare idiopathic epilepsy of new-born humans. BFNC syndrome exhibits genetic heterogeneity, as has been hypothesised to occur in Arabian foals, and is known to be caused by mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes. They also demonstrate that sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common IE syndromes. The underlying genetic abnormalities of rare familial idiopathic epilepsy have been identified, such as mutation in KCNQ2, a K(+) channel gene. Sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common idiopathic epilepsy syndromes. This paper summarizes recent findings concerning sodium (SCN1A) and potassium channel (KCNQ2 and KCNQ3) dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of rare and common idiopathic epilepsies (IE).  Mutations in the SCN1A gene are found in up to 80% of individuals with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), and mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were identified in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) as well as in single families with Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE). The involvement of KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) and KCNQ3 (Kv7.3) in a benign idiopathic neonatal epilepsy, KCNQ4 (Kv7.4) in a form of congenital deafness, and the discovery that neuronal KCNQ heteromultimers were among the molecular substrates of M-channels, resulted in a high level of interest for potential drug development strategies Mutations in the SCN1A gene are found in up to 80% of individuals with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), and mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were identified in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) as well as in single families with Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) The functional interaction between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 provides a framework for understanding how mutations in either channel can cause a form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy Mutations in KCNQ2- or KCNQ3-encoding genes cause benign familiar neonatal convulsions (BFNCs), a rare autosomal-dominant idiopathic epilepsy of the newborn Mutations in KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 that reduce the M-current are responsible for benign familial neonatal seizures, a rare autosomal dominant idiopathic epilepsy of the newborn These include benign familial neonatal convulsions due to mutations in KCNQ2 or KCNQ3, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus due to mutations in SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN1B, and GABRG2, autosomal-dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) due to a mutation in GABRA1 and mutations in CLCN2 associated with several IGE sub-types KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations contribute to different idiopathic epilepsy syndromes Role of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes in juvenile idiopathic epilepsy in Arabian foals Mutations in the voltage gated potassium channel gene KCNQ2 and the homologous gene KCNQ3 have been found to cause a rare monogenic subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, the benign familial neonatal convulsions Role of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes in juvenile idiopathic epilepsy in Arabian foals.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes. Mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene is responsible for the inherited genetic disease of tuberous sclerosis complex. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a frequent autosomal-dominant condition (affecting 1 in 6000 individuals) caused by various mutations in either the hamartin (TSC1) or the tuberin gene (TSC2). Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disease Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a genetic disease with prominent cutaneous and brain involvement  TSC was recognized to be a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance On average TSC families are very small; in most cases there are fewer than two informative meioses. The size distribution of chromosome 9 linked families was similar to that of non-linked families. The effects of missense changes and small in-frame deletions and insertions on protein function are not easy to predict, and the identification of such variants in individuals at risk of a genetic disease can complicate genetic counselling. One option is to perform functional tests to assess whether the variants affect protein function. We have used this strategy to characterize variants identified in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes in individuals with, or suspected of having, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC).

For the comparison of short-term ospemifene with placebo, parabasal cells (the standardized mean difference [SMD] = -37.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -41.83 to -33.17, P < 0.00001), superficial cells (SMD = 9.24, 95% CI = 7.70 to 10.79, P < 0.00001), vaginal PH (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.80, P = 0.00001), and dyspareunia (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.30, P = 0.00001) indicated that ospemifene was more effective than the placebo.  This meta-analysis indicates that ospemifene to be an effective and safe treatment for dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist, that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal women. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the oral, non-estrogen agent ospemifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue-selective effects (also called a selective estrogen receptor modulator) that was recently approved for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Here, we review the estrogen agonist/antagonist profile of ospemifene, a novel triphenylethylene derivative recently approved to treat dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) due to menopause, both preclinically and clinically.  Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking.  Ospemifene is a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. SERMs with positive vaginal effects (such as improvement in the vaginal maturation index, reduced vaginal pH, and improvement in the signs and symptoms of VVA) on postmenopausal symptomatic women include lasofoxifene (clinical development on hold) and ospemifene, which was recently approved for the treatment of VVA-related dyspareunia, with a class effect warning of potential venous thrombosis risk.  Ospemifene is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ospemifene leading to this first approval for moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The aim of this work was to study the role of ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia and physiological vaginal changes.  In this study, once-daily oral ospemifene 60 mg was effective for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia. Clinical trials have confirmed that daily doses are well-tolerated and that it is effective in normalizing vaginal maturation index and pH as well as improving the symptoms associated with VVA including dyspareunia. Ospemifene was shown to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of the symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with vulvovaginal atrophy over and above the use of provided lubricants."
Isn't bapineuzumab effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease?,yes,"Thus far, results from two large phase 3 trial programs with bapineuzumab and solaneuzumab, respectively, have brought rather disappointing results. More recently, in phase III studies, bapineuzumab has been discontinued because it did not prove clinically effective (despite its significant effect on biomarkers), while solaneuzumab has been found effective in slowing AD progression.  Passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Aβ is in late clinical development but recently the two most advanced mAbs, Bapineuzumab and Solanezumab, targeting an N-terminal or central epitope, respectively, failed to meet their target of improving or stabilizing cognition and function. The marginal effects observed in recent clinical studies of solanezumab, targeting monomeric Aβ, and bapineuzumab, targeting amyloid plaques, prompted expert comments that drug discovery efforts in Alzheimer's disease should focus on soluble forms of Aβ rather than fibrillar Aβ deposits found in amyloid plaques. Phase III trials showed that bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive and functional performances in AD patients, and was associated with a high incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Clinical trials on various drugs, including AN1792, bapineuzumab, and solanezumab, have been carried out; however, all trials have failed to demonstrate apparent clinical benefits.  Despite the alteration in biochemical composition, all 3 immunized subjects exhibited continued cognitive decline. Despite negative topline phase 3 clinical trial results for bapineuzumab and solanezumab in mild to moderate AD, findings from these trials and recent advances suggest renewed optimism for anti-amyloid therapies.  The lack of progress in the development of disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was highlighted recently by the cessation of a phase 3 clinical trial studying the effects of bapineuzumab on mild to moderate disease. No treatment benefit was apparent, whereas several serious side effects occurred more commonly in the treatment group compared to placebo.  Clinical studies using the N-terminal-directed anti-Aβ antibody bapineuzumab have demonstrated reduced brain PET-Pittsburg-B signals, suggesting the reduction of Aβ plaques, and reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein in the CSF of treated AD patients. Preclinical studies using 3D6 (the murine form of bapineuzumab) have demonstrated resolution of Aβ plaque and vascular burdens, neuritic dystrophy, and preservation of synaptic density in the transgenic APP mouse models. The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E ε4 carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the Aβ peptide.   The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, composed of humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, that has been tested in two Phase II trials, demonstrating to reduce Aβ burden in the brain of AD patients. However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab appears uncertain. The occurrence of vasogenic edema, especially in apolipoprotein E 4 carriers, may limit its clinical use and have led to abandon the highest dose of the drug (2 mg/kg). However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain. Moreover, the occurrence of vasogenic edema and, more rarely, brain microhemorrhages, especially in apolipoprotein E ϵ4 carriers, have led to abandoning of the highest dose of the drug.  However, the preliminary equivocal cognitive results obtained with bapineuzumab as well as the detrimental cognitive effects observed with semagacestat, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor, raise the possibility that targeting Aβ may not be clinically efficacious in AD.  The patient received four bapineuzumab infusions over a 39 week period. During the course of this treatment, there was no remarkable change in cognitive impairment as determined by MMSE scores. Forty-eight days after the fourth bapineuzumab infusion was given, MRI revealed that the patient had developed lacunar infarcts and possible vasogenic edema, probably related to immunotherapy, but a subsequent MRI scan 38 days later demonstrated resolution of vasogenic edema. The patient expired due to acute congestive heart failure complicated by progressive AD and cerebrovascular accident 378 days after the first bapineuzumab infusion and 107 days after the end of therapy. Neuropathological and biochemical analysis did not produce evidence of lasting plaque regression or clearance of Aβ due to immunotherapy. These results suggest that, in this particular case, bapineuzumab immunotherapy neither resulted in detectable clearance of amyloid plaques nor prevented further cognitive impairment. Bapineuzumab has been shown to reduce Aβ burden in the brain of AD patients. However, its preliminary cognitive efficacy appears uncertain, particularly in ApoE ε4 carriers, and vasogenic edema may limit its clinical use.  Bapineuzumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral beta-amyloid peptide burden in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, particularly in APOE 4 carriers, its ability to slow disease progression remains uncertain, and vasogenic edema - a dose-limiting and potentially severe adverse reaction - may limit its clinical applicability. The first is a phase 2 study of passive immunotherapy with bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminus of Abeta. This trial showed no differences within dose cohorts on the primary efficacy analysis. Exploratory analyses showed potential treatment differences on cognitive and functional endpoints in study completers and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 noncarriers. A safety concern was the occurrence of reversible vasogenic edema.  The first passive immunotherapy trial with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the end terminus of Abeta, also encountered some dose dependent adverse events during the Phase II portion of the study, vasogenic edema in 12 cases, which were significantly over represented in ApoE4 carriers."
Has the protein SETMAR (Metnase) a transposase domain?,yes,"Metnase (SETMAR) is a SET-transposase fusion protein that promotes nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair in humans. The transposase domain protein Metnase/SETMAR suppresses chromosomal translocations.  Metnase (also termed SETMAR) is a fusion of a histone methylase and transposase protein that arose specifically in primates.  the only intact Hsmar1 transposase gene exists within a chimeric SET-transposase fusion protein referred to as Metnase or SETMAR.  The Metnase transposase has been remarkably conserved through evolution; Metnase (also known as SETMAR) is a SET and transposase fusion protein in humans and plays a positive role in double-strand break (DSB) repair. While the SET domain possesses histone lysine methyltransferase activity, the transposase domain is responsible for 5'-terminal inverted repeat (TIR)-specific binding, DNA looping, and DNA cleavage activities.  Metnase is a fusion gene comprising a SET histone methyl transferase domain and a transposase domain derived from the Mariner transposase. ulated by the DNA repair component Metnase (also termed SETMAR). Metnase contains a SET histone methylase and transposase nuclease domain Metnase is a human SET and transposase domain protein  The human set and transposase domain protein Metnase  of transposase-related sequences in humans are pseudogenes. We recently isolated and characterized a SET and transposase domain protein termed Metnase that promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Both the SET and transposase domain were required for its NHEJ activity. Metnase, also known as SETMAR, is a SET and transposase fusion protein with an undefined role in mammalian DNA repair. Biochemical characterization of a SET and transposase fusion protein, Metnase: i Metnase (SETMAR) is a SET and transposase fusion protein that promotes in vivo end joining activity and mediates genomic integration of foreign DNA.   This transposase coding region is part of the SETMAR gene, in which a histone methylatransferase SET domain is fused to an Hsmar1 transposase domain.  The human SETMAR protein preserves most of the activities of the ancestral Hsmar1 transposase. ere we investigate the activity of the human SETMAR protein, a highly expressed fusion between a histone H3 methylase and a mariner family transposase. SETMAR, a new primate chimeric gene resulting from fusion of a SET histone methyltransferase gene to the transposase gene of a mobile element. We identified a protein, termed Metnase, that has a SET domain and a transposase/nuclease domain.  Metnase has a nuclease domain that shares homology with the Transposase family. Metnase (also called SETMAR) is a SET and transposase domain protein that promotes both DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and restart of stalled replication forks."
Aren't neurexins localized at pre-synapses?,no,"Neurexins and neuroligins are two distinct families of single-pass transmembrane proteins localized at pre- and postsynapses, respectively.  presynaptic neurexins best-characterized transsynaptic interactions are formed by presynaptic neurexins, which bind to diverse postsynaptic ligands. presynaptic neurexin"
Is poly (ADP- ribosylation) involved in transcriptional control?,yes,"Histone phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, SUMOylation and poly-ADP-ribosylation, as well as ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes, play equally pivotal roles in the maintenance of transcriptional fidelity oly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1; EC 2.4.2.30) is an abundant nuclear protein that is involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, programmed cell death and transcriptional regulation. Many lines of evidence suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp-1) is involved in transcriptional regulation of various genes as a coactivator or a corepressor by modulating chromatin structure These results suggest that Parp-1 is required to maintain transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of genes on a genome-wide scale PARP-1 was identified as a part of the mH2A1.1 nucleosome complex and was found to be associated with the Hsp70.1 promoter Upon heat shock, the Hsp70.1 promoter-bound PARP-1 is released to activate transcription through ADP-ribosylation of other Hsp70.1 promoter-bound proteins Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited 75% of PAP gene induction and 4-hydroxyquinazolone, the highly specific inhibitor of the enzyme, blocked almost completely PAP expression, suggesting that ADP-ribosylation was indeed required for the upregulation of PAP gene expression by cycloheximide  inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase suppressed UV-induced HIV-1 gene expression but not tat-mediated expression oly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors suppress UV-induced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression"
Has intepirdine been evaluated in clinical trials? (November 2017),yes,"Using small molecules blocking 5-HT6serotonin receptor (intepirdine), inhibiting BACE activity (E2609, AZD3293, and verubecestat), or reducing tau aggregation (TRx0237) are also currently in Phase III clinical trials."
Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,yes,"In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here we show that the CG9754 protein is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 to nascent messenger RNA transcripts causes cotranscriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We have named CG9754 ""Panoramix,"" and we propose that this protein could act as an adaptor, scaffolding interactions between the piRNA pathway and the general silencing machinery that it recruits to enforce transcriptional repression. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. Thus, by reanimating RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA silencing. In different organisms, small RNAs were shown to be implicated in the posttranscriptional degradation of mRNA and/or transcriptional repression of the homologous locus. In Drosophila, the mechanism of piRNA-mediated silencing is still far from being understood Analyses of piRNA-mediated transcriptional transposon silencing in Drosophila Transcriptional silencing implies a piRNA-mediated formation of repressive chromatin which diminishes the transcriptional capacity of the target locus. In mice, piRNA-guided transposon repression correlates with establishment of CpG DNA methylation on their sequences, yet the mechanism and the spectrum of genomic targets of piRNA silencing are unknown Using a candidate gene KD-approach, we identified differences in the spatio-temporal requirements of the piRNA pathway components for piRNA-mediated silencing. Spatio-temporal requirements for transposable element piRNA-mediated silencing during Drosophila oogenesis In contrast, piRNA-mediated silencing is strong in germline stem cells in which TE mobilization is tightly repressed ensuring the continued production of viable germline cysts. Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. In germ cells, early embryos, and stem cells of animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have an important role in silencing retrotransposons, which are vicious genomic parasites, through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons.  Our observations confirm the pivotal role of piRNA-mediated silencing in defending the genome against selfish transposition, yet also suggest limits to the optimization of host genome defense. Analysis of piRNA-mediated silencing of active TEs in Drosophila melanogaster suggests limits on the evolution of host genome defense The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway defends animal genomes against the harmful consequences of transposable element (TE) infection by imposing small-RNA-mediated silencing. A novel organelle, the piNG-body, in the nuage of Drosophila male germ cells is associated with piRNA-mediated gene silencing. Proteins of the PIWI subfamily Aub and AGO3 associated with the germline-specific perinuclear granules (nuage) are involved in the silencing of retrotransposons and other selfish repetitive elements in the Drosophila genome.  Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the targets of piRNA-mediated silencing Mechanism of the piRNA-mediated silencing of Drosophila telomeric retrotransposons. Gene silencing mechanisms mediated by Aubergine piRNA complexes in Drosophila male gonad. The epigenetic trans-silencing effect in Drosophila involves maternally-transmitted small RNAs whose production depends on the piRNA pathway and HP1. Here, we show that mutations in squash and zucchini, which are involved in the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) silencing pathway, strongly affect TSE MVH in piRNA processing and gene silencing of retrotransposons piRNA-mediated silencing in Drosophila germlines. These have shed light not only on the molecular mechanisms of gene silencing mediated by piRNAs and PIWI proteins, but also on their intriguing relationship with cellular genes that have been shown to be important for gametogenesis and fertility. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene silencing To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation PIWI-interacting small non-coding RNAs (piRNAs) are genetic and epigenetic regulatory factors in germline cells, where they maintain genome stability, are involved in RNA silencing and regulate gene expression The piNG-body contains ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in piRNA-silencing of genome repeats including transposons in premeiotic spermatocytes with aid of short piRNAs Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons Recent studies have revealed not only the biogenesis of piRNAs and their roles in transposon silencing, but also the function of the Piwi-piRNA pathway in epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression A growing number of studies on piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA biogenesis These have shed light not only on the molecular mechanisms of gene silencing mediated by piRNAs and PIWI proteins, but also on their intriguing relationship with cellular genes that have been shown to be important for gametogenesis and fertility Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the targets of piRNA-mediated silencing.  MVH in piRNA processing and gene silencing of retrotransposons. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation.  Therefore piRNA-mediated transcriptional mode of silencing is involved in the control of retrotransposon expression in the Drosophila germline. Panoramix enforces piRNA-dependent cotranscriptional silencing. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene silencing. Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation."
Can the CEP290 gene mutations be targeted by AAV-mediated gene therapy?,no,The large size of the CEP290 gene prevents its use in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene augmentation therapy.
Is marijuana use associated with increased risk for stroke?,yes,"The illicit drugs more commonly associated with stroke are psychomotor stimulants, such as amphetamine and cocaine. Less commonly implicated are opioids and psychotomimetic drugs, including cannabis. Among 326 patients (184 males), the most frequent stroke risk factors overall were dyslipidaemia (187), smoking (161), hypertension (105) and obesity (92). Fifty-one patients used illicit drugs, mostly comprising marijuana and amphetamines. Patients in Adelaide are more likely to be obese, to be misusing marijuana and amphetamines, to suffer a cardioembolic event and to have a stroke that concurrently affects both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. RCVS was spontaneous in 37% of patients and secondary in the 63% others, to postpartum in 5 and to exposure to various vasoactive substances in 37, mainly cannabis, selective serotonin-recapture inhibitors and nasal decongestants. We reported two cases of young stroke associated with drug misuse. Case 1 used amphetamine, cocaine, marijuana and LSD for few yaers, and developed occlusion of a middle cerebral artery. Case 2 presented aphasia shortly after marijuana smoking. Marijuana may have accelerated stroke onset, but essential cause of stroke in this case must be protein S mutation. Cannabis is the most widely consumed among the illicit drugs worldwide, but it has only exceptionally been associated to cerebrovascular disease. We here describe 2 young patients (26 and 29 years, respectively) who suffered from ischemic stroke in temporal relation with cannabis consumption. The review of the literature on this topic reveals another 18 patients with stroke in association to cannabis use. Although a causal relationship is difficult to establish due to the widespread use of cannabis, this drug may play an etiologic role in ischemic stroke. Marijuana may trigger a myocardial infarction and have a vasospastic effect. Despite the fact that cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug, there are only a few reports associating its use with cerebrovascular disease. We describe a patient who suffered three ischaemic strokes immediately after cannabis consumption. Cannabis use may be associated with ischaemic stroke in young patients, but its mechanism is unclear. A right occipital ischemic stroke occurred in a 37-year-old Albanese man with a previously uneventful medical history, 15 min after having smoked a cigarette with approximately 250 mg of marijuana. Therefore, as the family history for cerebrovascular events, blood pressure, clotting tests, examinations for thrombophilia, vasculitis, extracranial and intracranial arteries and cardiac investigations were normal or respectively negative, the stroke was attributed to the chronic cannabis consumption. Three adolescent males had similar presentations of headache, fluctuating level of consciousness or lethargy, visual disturbance, and variable ataxia after self-administration of marijuana. Episodic marijuana use may represent a risk factor for stroke in childhood, particularly in the posterior circulation. Although several mechanisms exist by which marijuana use might contribute to the development of chronic cardiovascular conditions or acutely trigger cardiovascular events, there are few data regarding marijuana/THC use and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Reported here is the case of a previously healthy young man who smoked marijuana on a daily basis and had an occipital lobe stroke; he was found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden. This case suggests that marijuana smoking may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis in otherwise healthy individuals who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden. Thus, chronic abuse of marijuana might be a risk factor for stroke. A 22-year-old man with a five-year history of drug and alcohol abuse presented with a left hemiparesis preceded by three transient ischaemic attacks, two of which occurred whilst smoking cannabis. Substance abuse was the only identifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF. Research directions might include more studies of cardiovascular disease outcomes and relationships of marijuana with cardiovascular risk factors, studies of metabolic and physiologic effects of chronic marijuana use that may affect cardiovascular disease risk, increased understanding of the role of the cannabinoid receptor system in cardiovascular regulation, and studies to determine if there is a therapeutic role for cannabinoids in blood pressure control or for neuroprotection after stroke."
Isn't there any association between Jarid2 and miR-155 in Th17 cells?,no,"Jarid2 links MicroRNA and chromatin in Th17 cells. In this issue of Immunity, Escobar et al. (2014) bring microRNAs and chromatin together by showing how activation-induced miR-155 targets the chromatin protein Jarid2 to regulate proinflammatory cytokine production in T helper 17 cells. miR-155 activates cytokine gene expression in Th17 cells by regulating the DNA-binding protein Jarid2 to relieve polycomb-mediated repression. Mir155 was bound by Th17 cell transcription factors and was highly expressed during Th17 cell differentiation. miR-155-deficient Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells expressed increased amounts of Jarid2, a DNA-binding protein that recruits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to chromatin. PRC2 binding to chromatin and H3K27 histone methylation was increased in miR-155-deficient cells, coinciding with failure to express Il22, Il10, Il9, and Atf3. Defects in Th17 cell cytokine expression and Treg cell homeostasis in the absence of Mir155 could be partially suppressed by Jarid2 deletion. Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2. Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2. Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2.

Is apixaban effective for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism?,yes,"Apixaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, and is a potential alternative for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism.  These results suggest a lack of clear superiority of apixaban relative to enoxaparin. Apixaban is an oral alternative with similar efficacy and safety to existing anticoagulant therapies. A fixed-dose regimen of apixaban alone was noninferior to conventional therapy for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and was associated with significantly less bleeding To critically review the effectiveness of the novel oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, ximelagatran, and apixaban) in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. ompared with vitamin K antagonists, the novel oral anticoagulants had a similar risk of recurrence of acute venous thromboembolism and all cause mortality, though rivaroxaban was associated with a reduced risk of bleeding Nowadays, the new anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, show potential advantages over classical treatments. These agents inhibit specific coagulation factors and are administered orally at fixed doses.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,yes,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing."
Is vemurafenib used for thyroid cancer?,yes,"Vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive metastatic or unresectable papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine: a non-randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.

Isn't there any software for automated analysis of immuno-histochemistry images?,no,"The LIM homeobox gene Lhx2 is expressed in cortical progenitors during development and also in the superficial layers of the neocortex in maturity. However, analysis of Lhx2 function at later stages of cortical development has been hampered by severe phenotypes associated with early loss of function.  The vein graft samples were obtained on each time point after surgery. The expression of the EDRz transfected in the vein graft was detected using a fluorescent microscope. Early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) mRNA was measured using reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization. And the protein expression of Egr-1 was detected by using western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme, which amongst other functions, is involved in cell differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TG2 contributes to differentiation of OPCs into OLGs and thereby stimulates remyelination."
Is pregnancy an additional risk during during H1N1 infection?,yes,"H1N1 influenza in pregnancy can be associated with severe complications This case series confirms a high number of complications in pregnant women due to pandemic H1N1/09. Pregnant women might be at increased risk for complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection. Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from pandemic influenza H1N1 virus infection.  Vaccination of pregnant women against influenza A (H1N1) by Russian subunit formulation (MonoGrippol plus) showed reactogenicity comparable to control group by the level of influence on general metabolic and immunologic homeostasis and on the course of pregnancy, which is an evidence of its safety Pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010 While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to H1N1 influenza virus in pregnant women. Although limited in size, the fully prospective nature of the safety follow-up of these women vaccinated during pregnancy is unique and offers an important degree of reassurance for the use of the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 (2009) vaccine in this high risk group for H1N1 infection. During the H1N1 2009 pandemic, pregnant women constituted one of the priority groups for vaccination in many countries, creating a need for close monitoring of the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women Emerging data suggest that pregnancy conveys high risk for severe complications from the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (2009 H1N1) infection Pregnant women have been identified as a group at risk, both for respiratory complications than for the admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic This report mitigates substantially the presumed severity of pandemic H1N1/09 influenza infection during pregnancy The results of our study do not indicate a risk for the pregnant woman and the developing embryo/fetus after H1N1 vaccination This large cohort study found no evidence of an increased risk of fetal death associated with exposure to an adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine during pregnancy Our results suggest that second- or third-trimester H1N1 vaccination was associated with improved fetal and neonatal outcomes during the recent pandemic Pregnant women might thus be at increased risk of complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection, and illness may progress rapidly Pregnant women with H1N1 infection seem to benefit from antiviral therapy. arly identification and treatment were the most important factors in different countries and areas examined. The vaccine and antiviral drugs that have been the most efficient means to control the novel virus appear to be safe but require more extensive study However, there were significant differences between the two groups in relation to mean age, treatment with oseltamivir, schooling, and presence of other risk factors To investigate whether exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. In this Danish cohort, exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of major birth defects, preterm birth, or fetal growth restriction Most people affected by the virus, including pregnant women, suffer a mild viral illness, and make a full recovery Pregnant women, because of their altered immunity and physiological adaptations, are at higher risk of developing pulmonary complications, especially in the second and third trimesters The pregnancy outcomes were also poor for women who were affected by the virus with a fivefold increase in the perinatal mortality rate and threefold increase in the preterm delivery rate regnant women were at increased risk for serious outcomes of 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (influenza A[H1N1]pdm09) infection, but little is known about the overall impact of the pandemic on neonatal and maternal outcomes In this large, geographically diverse population, A(H1N1)pdm09 infection increased the risk for hospitalization during pregnancy Vaccination during pregnancy with Pandemrix(®) appeared to have no ill effects on the pregnancy. On the contrary, the rate of preterm birth and low birthweight was lower than expected, which agrees with some previous results During the influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 pandemic, although many cases occurred in younger adults, the risk factors identified for severe infections and complications were similar to those for seasonal influenza, including chronic respiratory, renal, liver, and heart diseases. In terms of pregnancy, the studies have shown contradictory results due to variations in methodology and medical care. However, it seems that pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, increases the risk of complications, and that early antiviral treatment is associated with improved outcomes. Pregnant women with mild clinical illness secondary to 2009 H1N1 were not at a greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes However, severely infected women were more likely to deliver SGA infants Gestational age is associated with the risk of developing critical infection. The risk increases with increasing weeks of gestation.  Following the start of winter in Liaoning province in China, the number of pregnant women infected with influenza increased significantly regnancy, with or without additional complications, constitutes a high-risk condition for complications of influenza infection and warrants early intervention with neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, if influenza is suspected"
Is nicotinamide effective for skin cancer prevention?,yes,"Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses. ESULTS: At 12 months, the rate of new nonmelanoma skin cancers was lower by 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 38) in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group (P=0.02). Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05). The number of actinic keratoses was 11% lower in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group at 3 months (P=0.01), 14% lower at 6 months (P<0.001), 20% lower at 9 months (P<0.001), and 13% lower at 12 months (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients. Nicotinamide is a safe, widely available vitamin that reduces the immune suppressive effects of UV, enhances DNA repair in keratinocytes and has shown promise in the chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer.   In summary, nicotinamide, by enhancing DNA repair in melanocytes, is a potential agent for the chemoprevention of cutaneous melanoma. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers.  Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) prevents UV-induced immunosuppression and carcinogenesis in mice, and solar-simulated (ss) UV-induced immunosuppression in humans. These results show that nicotinamide enhances two different pathways for repair of UV-induced photolesions, supporting nicotinamide's potential as an inexpensive, convenient and non-toxic agent for skin cancer chemoprevention. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers. No noteworthy between-group differences were found with respect to the number or types of adverse events during the 12-month intervention period, and there was no evidence of benefit after nicotinamide was discontinued.CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients.  Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses.METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 386 participants who had had at least two nonmelanoma skin cancers in the previous 5 years to receive 500 mg of nicotinamide twice daily or placebo for 12 months.  Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05).  Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients. Nicotinamide has shown potential as a safe and effective intervention for the prevention of malignant and premalignant skin lesions. Nicotinamide, which protected against both UVB and UVA, is a promising agent for skin cancer prevention."
Isn't Cryptococcus neoformans a frequent cause of isolated skin infections in immunocompromised individuals,yes,"Cryptococcus is an opportunistic yeast with a worldwide distribution that primarily causes significant infections in immunocompromised individuals, generally by affecting the respiratory tract. But primary cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC) without systemic infection is rare.  Cryptococcus is a ubiquitous fungus and is known for causing meningitis and cutaneous infections in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can cause primary pulmonary infections or disseminate and cause infections of the central nervous system, meninges, skin, and bone in the immunocompromised host. The authors report a male patient, a seller with no detected immunosuppression, with an extensive ulcerated skin lesion localized on the left forearm, caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var."
Aren't BRAF mutations common in melanoma?,no,"patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. BRAF-mutated melanoma  The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has been reported to be activated in over 80% of all cutaneous melanomas, making it the focus of many scientific studies in the melanoma field. Discoveries of mutations and aberrant expression of components in this cascade, in particular, BRAF and NRAS render a deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for oncogenesis and provide new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease.   BRAF-targeted therapies (e.g., vemurafenib, dabrafenib) have showed impressive results in systemic therapy for melanoma harboring activating BRAF V600E mutations.   An independent cohort of 91 archival MUPs was also screened for 46 hot spot mutations highly prevalent in melanoma including BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11.  a high rate of BRAF (45 of 101, 45%) and NRAS (32 of 101, 32%) mutations, collectively indicating a mutation profile consistent with cutaneous sun-exposed melanomas. Treatment of advanced melanoma has been improved with the advent of the BRAF inhibitors. BRAF is the most prevalent oncogene and an important therapeutic target in melanoma. Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  BRAF mutations have emerged as an important predictive biomarker for metastasized melanoma.  BRAF V600 selective inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of V600 mutation positive metastatic melanoma,  BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma  Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. The treatment of patients with advanced melanoma is rapidly evolving due to an improved understanding of molecular drivers of this disease. Somatic mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alteration found in these tumors.  genetically activated BRAF, is now commonly prescribed for metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF mutation. BRAF inhibitors improve melanoma patient survival, but resistance invariably develops.  BRAF inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal.  Most patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors.  BRAF(V600E) mutation confers constitutive BRAK kinase activation in melanoma cells, promoting tumor growth. This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.  (V600)BRAF mutation was identified as an ideal target for clinical therapy due to its indispensable roles in supporting melanoma initiation and progression. The Braf(V600E) mutation has been detected in patients with metastatic melanoma, colon, thyroid, and other cancers. Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patient BRAF mutations occur in approximately 8% of all human cancers and approach 50% in melanoma and papillary carcinoma of thyroid. Vemurafenib is a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the V600 mutant form of the BRAF protein used in the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer. Molecular studies demonstrated that the melanoma was positive for the 1799T>A (V600E) mutation in the BRAF gene. RAF kinase inhibitors have substantial therapeutic effects in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. An activating BRAF (V600E) kinase mutation occurs in approximately half of melanomas.  Activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in approximately 50% of melanomas. More than 70% of BRAF mutations are V600E and 10-30% are V600K. Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  Personalized melanoma medicine has progressed from histopathologic features to serum markers to molecular profiles. Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patients. The clinical activity of BRAF inhibitor (BRAF-I) therapy is a major breakthrough in the treatment of metastatic melanoma carrying BRAF mutations.  The discovery of BRAF mutations in melanoma led to the development of BRAF inhibitors for the treatment of advanced melanoma.  BRAF represents one of the most frequently mutated protein kinase genes in human tumours. The mutation is commonly tested in pathology practice. BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients.  A majority of cutaneous melanomas show activating mutations in the NRAS or BRAF proto-oncogenes, components of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in ∼50% of all melanomas has proved to be a turning point in the therapeutic management of the disseminated disease. This review summarizes the critical role of BRAF in melanoma pathophysiology, the clinical and pathological determinants of BRAF mutation status and finally addresses the current state of the art of BRAF inhibitors. To better understand the BRAF mutation profile in melanomas, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1112 primary and metastatic melanomas at our institution. The cohort included nonacral cutaneous (n = 774), acral (n = 111), mucosal (n = 26), uveal (n = 23), leptomeningeal (n = 1), and metastatic melanomas of unknown primary site (n = 177). BRAF mutation hotspot regions in exons 11 and 15 were analyzed by pyrosequencing or with the primer extension MassARRAY system. A total of 499 (44.9%) specimens exhibited BRAF mutations, involving exon 15 [497 (99.6%)] or exon 11 [2 (0.4%)]. p.V600E was detected in 376 (75.4%) cases; the remaining 123 (24.6%) cases exhibited non-p.V600E mutations, of which p.V600K was most frequent [86 (17.2%)]. BRAF mutations were more frequent in nonacral cutaneous (51.4%) than acral melanomas [18 (16.2%)] (P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference among cutaneous histological subtypes. All mucosal, uveal, and leptomeningeal melanomas were BRAF wild type (WT). Recently, it was reported that BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma. Activating mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alterations in melanoma. Oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequent in malignant melanoma. Mutation of BRAF is now known to be common in cutaneous melanomas, and raises possible new therapeutic options of anti-RAF treatment for these patients BRAF mutations are common events in a variety of melanocytic nevi and primary cutaneous melanomas Approximately 40-60% of melanomas from Caucasian populations carry activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene, with the most common being the p.Val600Glu (V600E) hotspot mutation in exon 15 Using a cohort of 115 patients with primary invasive melanomas, we show that BRAF mutations are statistically significantly more common in melanomas occurring on skin subject to intermittent sun exposure than elsewhere (23 of 43 patients; P<.001, two-sided Fisher's exact test) BRAF mutations have been identified as the most common oncogene mutation in melanomas, especially important in those originating on nonchronically sun-damaged skin."
Don't cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,yes,"Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions By adopting a method originally designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in Drosophila and cephalopods. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish) are active, resourceful predators with a rich behavioural repertoire. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which showed elevated expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin, the suckers and the nervous system. Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a handful of gene families, along with extensive remodelling of genome linkage and repetitive content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological innovations, including their large and complex nervous systems."
Doesn't strenuous physical activity affect thyroid hormone metabolism?,no,"The results of the present study in a unique experimental human model of maximal exposure to altitude and physical exercise demonstrate that extreme HA and strenuous physical exercise are coupled with specific endocrine adaptations. These include increased activity of the GH/IGF-I axis and a low T(3) syndrome 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 levels increase during strenuous exercise, and, at the end of the exercise bout, a decrease of T3 and T4 levels, with an increase in TSH during the following 4-5 days, is seen. the obtained results indicate that in intense exercise, causing the rapid development of fatigue, rapid increases in serum levels of hormones of the pituitary-adrenocortical, pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-thyroid systems occur. Mean levels of fasting plasma estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were significantly lower in AR compared to ER and SE. Reductions in plasma T4, T3 and T3/T4 ratio are probably due to inhibition of T4 secretion and 5'-monodeiodination with possible conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3). These processes may represent a mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous and extended flight. Strenuous endurance training seems to have minor changes on the function of the thyroid gland. Depressed T4 levels in runners may rather be due to lowered TBG levels than due to direct effect of training. brief strenuous swimming or moderate bicycle exercise had minor or no effect on thyroid hormone concentrations when consideration was given to the attendant hemoconcentration. thyroxine were determined in 26 men participating in a 90-km cross-country ski race, before, immediately after, and on the following days Total thyroxine and free thyroxine in serum were significantly increased at the end of the race, but had returned to the pre-raced levels during the rest of the observation period. There are controversial results concerning thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous exercise in adult athletes and only scant data concerning the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in children and adolescents."
Aren't defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,no,"Inherited mutations in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes.  Variants in the XRCC3 gene might result in altered protein structure or function which may influence DSBR efficiency and lead to cancer.  Although alcohol consumption is related to increased cancer risk, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that an intake of 10% alcohol for 4 weeks in rats is genotoxic due to induction of micronuclei. Acetaldehyde (AA), the first product of ethanol metabolism, is believed to be responsible for DNA damage induced by alcohol.  Although efficiency of these repair processes substantially decrease the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies that target DNA, compromised DNA repair contributes to mutagenesis and genomic instability leading to carcinogenesis. damage response and repair pathways are important barriers to carcinogenesis.  olymorphisms in DNA repair genes and differences in repair capacity between individuals have been widely documented. For colorectal cancer, the loss of mismatch repair gene activity is a key genetic determinant. Nucleotide excision repair (NER), recombination repair (RR) and base excision repair (BER) pathways have critical roles in protection against other cancers, and we wished to investigate their role in colorectal cancer."

"Does the concentration of protein HIF-1α increase after the administration of the cytoprotective prodrug""amifostine"" (ethyol) ?",yes,"We demonstrated that the treatment of several human cancer cell lines with therapeutical doses of WR-1065 led to a strong induction of different VEGF-A mRNA isoforms independently of HIF-1alpha e investigated the involvement of hypoxia-regulated proteins (Hypoxia inducible factors HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and carbonic anhydrase CA9) in HNC resistance to accelerated and hypofractionated radiotherapy In accord with previously reported studies, high levels of the hypoxia regulated proteins HIF1alpha and CA9 in HNC predict resistance to platinum based radio-chemotherapy. Whether HIF2alpha expressing tumors are more sensitive to larger radiotherapy fractions, compared to standard radiotherapy fractionation, is an issue that deserves further investigation. HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha were expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm of cancer cells, while CA9 had a membrane reactivity. A high expression of HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9 was noted in 21/39 (53.8%), 20/39 (51.3%) and 23/39 (58.9%) cases, respectively. Complete response was obtained in 85.2% of patients and HIF1alpha was marginally related with persistent disease after RT (p = 0.05). HIF1alpha was significantly associated with poor local relapse free survival (LRFS) (p = 0.006) and overall survival (p = 0.008), whilst HIF2alpha was no  The glucose and oxygen levels in the peripheral blood of patients receiving 1000 mg amifostine were determined at various time-points in order to investigate the metabolic changes induced by amifostine. MDA468 breast tumor cell lines were incubated with a high amifostine concentration (10 m M) to overcome the natural resistance of cancer cells to influx of the non-hydrolyzed WR-2721, and the HIF1 alpha protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis Since it is doubtful whether dephosphorylation of amifostine to the active metabolite WR-1065 occurs within tumoral tissues (an acidic environment that lacks vascular alkaline phosphatase activity), intracellular hypoxia and upregulation of HIF1 alpha represents an additional, normal tissue-specific, amifostine cytoprotective pathway. .

Isn't hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents a hallmark of Fanconi anemia?,no,"The Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex plays a central role in the DNA damage response network FAAP100-deficient cells display hallmark features of FA cells, including defective FANCD2 monoubiquitination, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and genomic instability. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by aplastic anemia, cancer/leukemia susceptibility and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, such as cisplatin. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited chromosomal recessive syndrome characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and bone marrow failure, which cause aplastic anemia, and an increased incidence of malignancy. Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of DNA repair in Fanconi anemia. Fanconi anemia (FA) is one of several genetic diseases with characteristic cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents which suggest that FA proteins may function as part of DNA repair processes. Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, but how the Fanconi pathway protects cells from DNA crosslinks and whether FA proteins act directly on crosslinks remain unclear. Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder associated with a bone-marrow failure, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a heterogeneous disease associated with a bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized by defective DNA repair and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease characterized by bone marrow failure, increased cancer risk and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, implying a role for this pathway in the maintenance of genomic stability. Genetic or epigenetic inactivation of the pathway formed by the Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins occurs in several cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), rendering the affected tumors potentially hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agents. Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare autosomic recessive and X-linked disease with chromosomal instability after exposure to crosslinking agents as the hallmark. Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by chromosome instability, cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, and increased predisposition to malignancies. The Bloom protein (BLM) and Topoisomerase IIIalpha are found in association with proteins of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, a disorder manifesting increased cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Using siRNA depletion and gene knockout techniques, we show that FAAP100-deficient cells display hallmark features of FA cells, including defective FANCD2 monoubiquitination, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and genomic instability. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive human cancer prone syndrome featuring bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents exposure. FA is a chromosome instability syndrome characterized by childhood-onset aplastic anemia, cancer or leukemia susceptibility, and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Functional defects in the Fanconi pathway can result in a marked hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslinking agents, such as mitomycin C. At the cellular level, hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinks is the defining feature in Fanconi anemia. DNA crosslinking agents may led to DNA cross-linking lesion, and Fanconi anemia pathway plays a key role in repairing its cross-linking. Fanconi anemia (FA), an autosomal recessive disorder of children, is characterized by congenital or childhood aplastic anemia, multiple developmental anomalies, increased incidence of myeloid leukemia, increased spontaneous chromosome breakage, and cellular and chromosomal hypersensitivity to DNA bifunctional crosslinking and alkylating agents. elegans provides an excellent model system for the study of the Fanconi Anemia (FA), one of the hallmarks of which is sensitivity to interstrand crosslinking agents Using siRNA depletion and gene knockout techniques, we show that FAAP100-deficient cells display hallmark features of FA cells, including defective FANCD2 monoubiquitination, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and genomic instability One of the hallmark phenotypes of FA is cellular hypersensitivity to agents that induce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), such as mitomycin C (MMC) Furthermore, the cytological hallmark of FA, the DNA crosslink-induced radial chromosome formation, exemplifies an innate impairment in the repair of these particularly cytotoxic DNA lesions [A.D Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, but how the Fanconi pathway protects cells from DNA crosslinks and whether FA proteins act directly on crosslinks remain unclear Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of DNA repair in Fanconi anemia Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited chromosomal recessive syndrome characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and bone marrow failure, which cause aplastic anemia, and an increased incidence of malignancy Genetic or epigenetic inactivation of the pathway formed by the Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins occurs in several cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), rendering the affected tumors potentially hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agents Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human autosomal disorder characterized by cancer susceptibility and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C and diepoxybutane The Fanconi anemia pathway promotes DNA glycosylase-dependent excision of interstrand DNA crosslinks.

Is amiodarone a class I anti-arrhythmic drug?,no,"Common class I agents are excluded due to the inherent abnormal cardiac structure and function in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Class III drug options include dofetilide and amiodarone. Amiodarone has been used as an anti-arrhythmic drug since the 1970s and has an established role in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although considered to be a class III anti-arrhythmic, amiodarone also has class I, II and IV actions, which gives it a unique pharmacological and anti-arrhythmic profile.  Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative, introduced in 1960's as an anti-anginal agent, emerged as a potent anti-arrhythmic agent by 1970's and is currently one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in US for ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent. Amiodarone, a representative class III agent, exerts negative dromotropism by suppressing the fast sodium current responsible for conduction in acute administration (class I effects). Chronic amiodarone causes prolongation of ERP (class III effects), which is sometimes associated with negative dromotropism based on the alteration of passive or active membrane properties. Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with predominantly class III anti-arrhythmic effects, is used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is one of the most effective drugs used in the treatment of ventricular and paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent Although considered to be a class III anti-arrhythmic, amiodarone also has class I, II and IV actions, which gives it a unique pharmacological and anti-arrhythmic profile Amiodarone is a potent class III anti-arrhythmic drug that also possesses beta-blocking properties"
Is Dicer part of the RISC loading complex?,yes,"Dicer is a component of the protein machinery (the RNA Induced Silencing Complex [RISC]) which is involved in catalyzing the formation of mature microRNAs from their precursors in the process of microRNA biogenesis. RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) Proteins PACT, TRBP, and Dicer are SRA binding nuclear receptor coregulators. The cytoplasmic RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) contains dsRNA binding proteins, including protein kinase RNA activator (PACT), transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP), and Dicer, that process pre-microRNAs into mature microRNAs (miRNAs) that target specific mRNA species for regulation.   Although the major RNAi pathway proteins are found in most subcellular compartments, the miRNA- and siRNA-loaded Ago2 populations co-sediment almost exclusively with the rER membranes, together with the RISC loading complex (RLC) factors Dicer, TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) and protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT). RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are liberated from double-stranded (ds)RNA precursors by Dicer and guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to targets. . Dicer, an RNase III enzyme, plays a central role in the RNAi pathway by cleaving precursors of both of these classes of RNAs to form mature siRNAs and miRNAs, which are then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).  Canonical siRNAs are 21 nucleotides (nt) in length and are loaded to the RNA Induced Silencing Complex when introduced into the cells, while longer siRNA molecules are first processed by endogenous Dicer and thus termed Dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA)."
Aren't Notch mutations related to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL)?,no,"Notch receptors participate in a highly conserved signalling pathway that regulates normal development and tissue homeostasis in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Deregulated Notch signalling has been implicated in many diseases, but the clearest example of a pathogenic role is found in T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-LL), in which the majority of human and murine tumours have acquired mutations that lead to aberrant increases in Notch1 signalling. NOTCH proteins (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4) play crucial roles in embryonic development. Also, mounting evidence indicates that NOTCH contributes to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic and solid malignancies. Recent studies reported a high incidence of gain-of-function mutations of the NOTCH1 gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL).  Our data indicate that NOTCH1 is mutated in T-ALL, but not in other common human cancers, and that NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTH4 genes are rarely mutated in common human cancers.  The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies. Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is characterized as a high-risk stratified disease associated with frequent relapse, chemotherapy resistance, and a poorer prognostic outlook than B-precursor ALL. Many of the challenges in treating T-ALL reflect the lack of prognostic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities on which to base therapy, including targeted therapy. Notch1 activating mutations were identified in more than 50% of T-ALL cases and can be therapeutically targeted with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs).  Notch1 is a transmembrane receptor that is frequently mutated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) is characterized by aberrant activation of NOTCH1 in over 60% of T-ALL cases. The high prevalence of activating NOTCH1 mutations highlights the critical role of NOTCH signaling in the pathogenesis of this disease and has prompted the development of therapeutic approaches targeting the NOTCH signaling pathway.  Activating mutations in NOTCH1, an essential regulator of T cell development, are frequently found in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients. Mutations in NOTCH1/FBXW7 activate NOTCH signaling and are of prognostic significance in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling. Activation of the Notch pathway occurs commonly in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) because of mutations in Notch1 or Fbw7 and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients frequently display NOTCH1 activating mutations and Notch can transcriptionally down-regulate the tumor suppressor PTEN. The identification of activating mutations in NOTCH1 in over 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) has generated major interest in the elucidation of the mechanisms of transformation downstream of oncogenic NOTCH and in the targeting of the NOTCH signaling pathway in this disease. BACKGROUND: In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), activating mutations of NOTCH1 are observed in more than 50% of cases, whereas the t(7;9)(q34;q34) involving NOTCH1 at 9q34 and TRB@ at 7q34 is an extremely rare but recurrent translocation. Activating mutations in NOTCH1 consitute the most prominent genetic abnormality in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1 and dysregulation of MYC The Notch signaling pathway has been recognized as a key factor for the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), because of the high incidence of activating mutations of Notch1 Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)"
Is there an association between FGFR3 mutation and plagiocephaly?,yes,"Series of neurosurgical interventions were carried out, principally for acrocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly. The most common achondroplasia mutation, a p.Gly380Arg in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, was detected.   The most common mutation for achondroplasia (FGFR3 Gly380Arg, resulting in 1138G>A) was identified. Imaging studies disclosed complex craniosynostosis and neurosurgical intervention was carried out, particularly for posterior plagiocephaly. FGFR mutations and plagiocephaly. FGFR genes have important effects on bone development, and mutations in 4 ""hot spot"" exons of FGFR1-3 are found in many patients with craniosynostosis and some with synostotic plagiocephaly.  Mutation analyses in the FGFR3 gene revealed nucleotide alterations located in the mutational hot spot at amino acid residue 250 (g.C749). RESULTS: In our cohort of 159 patients with various craniosynostosis syndromes, mutations were found in 100% of patients with Apert syndrome, 83.3% with Pfeiffer syndrome, 72.7% with Crouzon syndrome, 50.0% with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, 27.7% with plagiocephaly, 31.8% with brachicephaly, 20% of complex cases, and 6.9% of mixed cases.  The genetic alterations that could cause unilateral coronal synostosis are more elusive. Mutations were found in eight of 47 patients: two patients with different single-amino-acid changes in FGFR2, three patients with FGFR3 Pro250Arg, and three patients with TWIST mutations.  Other abnormalities in the craniofacial region and extremities were clues to a particular mutation in FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST, or the X-linked mutation.  To determine whether the autosomal dominant fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) Pro250Arg mutation causes anterior plagiocephaly, patients with either apparently sporadic unicoronal synostosis (N = 37) or other forms of anterior plagiocephaly (N = 10) were studied for this mutation. The occurrence of the FGFR3 mutation among patients with unicoronal synostosis provides evidence for a genetic basis of certain forms of plagiocephaly. None of the 6 patients with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly and none of the 4 patients with additional suture synostosis had the FGFR3 mutation. Between January and December of 1996, patients with a diagnosis of plagiocephaly at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were evaluated for the FGFR3 mutation.

Isn't there any protein that undergoes both mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination?,no,"The yeast G protein alpha subunit Gpa1 represents a rare example of a protein that undergoes both mono- and poly-ubiquitination.  Expression of p34 promotes PTEN poly-ubiquitination, leading to PTEN protein degradation, whereas p34 knockdown results in PTEN mono-ubiquitination. These fingers possess E3 activities of mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination, respectively, with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-binding capabilities.  Instead of promoting poly-ubiquitination and degradation, we show that Smurf2 actually induces multiple mono-ubiquitination of Smad3 in vivo. mono-ubiquitination of CIITA dramatically increases its transactivity whereas poly-ubiquitination leads to CIITA degradation. This leads to a model in which Lys134 of LDB1 can be either mono-ubiquitinated, leading to stabilization, or poly-ubiquitinated, leading to degradation by the proteasome pathway.   mono-ubiquitination of CIITA increases its transactivity, whereas poly-ubiquitination of CIITA leads to its degradation PS1 ubiquitination after PI3K inhibition is represented by the multiple mono-ubiquitination, instead of poly-ubiquitination Our observations support a novel functional relationship between parkin and Hsc/Hsp70 and support the notion that parkin is a multi-purpose E3 ubiquitin ligase capable of modifying proteins either via attachment of alternatively linked poly-ubiquitin chains or through multiple mono-ubiquitination to achieve alternate biological outcomes our results indicate that Hsp70 facilitates CHIP-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Smad1 whereas it attenuates CHIP-meditated mono-ubiquitination of Smad1. Whereas poly-ubiquitination targets protein substrates for proteasomal degradation, mono-ubiquitination is known to regulate protein trafficking in the endosomal system and to target cargo proteins for lysosomal degradation. Our results suggest that oxidative stress induces not only poly-ubiquitination but also mono-ubiquitination of LDH-A, which may be involved in its lysosomal degradation during unloading. wild type Smad4 is a relatively stable protein that undergoes mono- or oligo-ubiquitination, a modification not linked to protein degradation These data suggest that oligo-ubiquitination positively regulates Smad4 function, whereas poly-ubiquitination primarily occurs in unstable cancer mutants and leads to protein degradation. We found that Ro52 was strongly conjugated by a single molecule of ubiquitin in cells. Although the biological relevance of this mono-ubiquitination was not defined, the function of Ro52 might be modified by the mono-ubiquitination. We also found that Ro52 was conjugated with poly-ubiquitin chain in cells (poly-ubiquitination)"
Can't siRNA affect response to afatinib treatment?,no,"On the other hand, miR-146a enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation by drugs targeting EGFR, including both TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) and a monoclonal antibody (cetuximab) These effects were independent of the EGFR mutation status (wild type, sensitizing mutation or resistance mutation), but were less potent compared to the effects of siRNA targeting of EGFR Among the anti-EGFR agents tested, the strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with T790M-specific-siRNAs The combination of a potent, irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib, with T790M-specific-siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer containing the resistant T790M mutation. The strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with an EGFR-specific siRNA The addition of EGFR siRNA to either TKIs or cetuximab additively enhanced growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in all five cell lines, independent of the EGFR mutation status (wild-type or sensitizing mutation or resistant mutation). The combination of a potent, irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib, with EGFR-specific siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer and other EGFR dependent cancers, including those with downstream resistance mutations."
Are conserved noncoding elements associated with developmental genes?,yes,"Some characteristics of CNEs include their high frequency in mammalian genomes, their potential regulatory role in gene expression, and their enrichment in gene deserts nearby master developmental genes we review recent findings that disruptions of CNEs, within or at long distance from the coding sequences of key genes involved in NCC development, result in neurocristopathies via the alteration of tissue- or stage-specific long-distance regulation of gene expression Genomic regulatory blocks are chromosomal regions spanned by long clusters of highly conserved noncoding elements devoted to long-range regulation of developmental genes Analysis of CNEs, at least some of which are candidate regulatory elements, suggests that ancestral CNEs partitioned between gene duplicates. These results help explain the evolutionary pathways by which the developmentally important family of FgfD molecules arose and the deduced principles that guided FgfD evolution are likely applicable to the evolution of developmental regulation in many vertebrate multigene families Pan-vertebrate developmental cis-regulatory elements are discernible as highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) and are often dispersed over large areas around the pleiotropic genes whose expression they control. On the loci of two developmental transcription factor genes, SOX3 and PAX6, we demonstrate that HCNEs conserved between human and zebrafish can be systematically and reliably tested for their regulatory function in multiple stable transgenes in zebrafish, and their genomic reach estimated with confidence using synteny conservation and HCNE density along these loci. HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish We show that human HCNEs result in expression patterns in zebrafish equivalent to those in mouse, establishing zebrafish as a suitable model for large-scale testing of human developmental enhancers HCNEs from the same area often drive overlapping patterns, suggesting that multiple regulatory inputs are required to achieve robust and precise complex expression patterns exhibited by developmental genes Organization of conserved elements near key developmental regulators in vertebrate genomes Further positional analysis of these conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the genome demonstrates that they cluster around genes involved in developmental regulation Ancora: a web resource for exploring highly conserved noncoding elements and their association with developmental regulatory genes Metazoan genomes contain arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) that span developmental regulatory genes and define regulatory domains The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs).

Disruption of long-distance highly conserved noncoding elements in neurocristopathies. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development. Despite this, attempts at unearthing genome-wide regulatory elements conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage using BLAST-like approaches have thus far detected noncoding conservation in only a few hundred genes, mostly associated with regulation of transcription and development.

Isn't paroxetine effective for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder?,no,"To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the four medications with a US FDA-approved indication for PMDD: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and drospirenone plus ethinyl estradiol (DRSP/EE). All SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and clomipramine) were effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms. Paroxetine has been approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder (PD), generalised anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adults, whereas paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of MDD, SAD, PD and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of PMDD and are recommended as first-line agents when pharmacotherapy is warranted. Currently fluoxetine, controlled-release paroxetine, and sertraline are the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for this indication. When compared with placebo, patients treated with paroxetine 20 mg attained a significant reduction in irritability (difference in median percent change: -23.9, 95% CI = -51.3 to -6.2, p = .014; difference in mean absolute change: -18.6, 95% CI = -32.5 to -4.6, p = .007). A statistically significant difference was not observed when the patients treated with the lower dose of paroxetine (10 mg) were compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected side effects. Intermittent administration of paroxetine 20 mg significantly reduced irritability symptoms in patients with PMDD. All these women had significant improvements in the HAMA, HAMD, CGI, and PRISM calendar. The rate of response to paroxetine treatment lay between 50% and 78.6% in the continuous-treatment group, and 37.5-93.8% in the intermittent-treatment group, as determined at the study end-point. The present results indicate that paroxetine is effective in both continuous and intermittent treatment of oriental PMDD women, and that the effects of active treatment lasted for six consecutive treatment menstrual cycles. Paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of major depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. Continuous treatment with paroxetine reduced premenstrual symptoms effectively with a response rate of 85%. Intermittent treatment was as effective as continuous treatment in reducing irritability, affect lability, and mood swings, but had a somewhat weaker effect on depressed mood and somatic symptoms. Daily Record of Severity of Problems scores were lower in the paroxetine group compared with the placebo group, although the differences were not statistically significant. However, the mean on-treatment Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (clinician-rated) score for the paroxetine group was 17.9 +/- 8.3 compared with 31.5 +/- 11.2 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference = 13.6, P = 0.009). Response (Clinical Global Impressions Scale score of 1 or 2) occurred in 70% of subjects randomized to paroxetine CR and 10% of those assigned to placebo (chi2(1) = 7.5, P = 0.006). The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada recently approved paroxetine for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Patients treated with either dose of paroxetine CR demonstrated significantly greater improvements on the primary efficacy measure (change from baseline in mean luteal phase VAS-Mood scores) and on the majority of secondary efficacy measures compared with patients randomly assigned to placebo. For the treatment of PMDD, luteal phase dosing with 12.5 mg and 25 mg of paroxetine CR is effective and generally well tolerated. A statistically significant difference was observed in favor of paroxetine CR 25 mg versus placebo on the VAS-Mood (adjusted mean difference = -12.58 mm, 95% CI = -18.40 to -6.76; p < .001) and for paroxetine CR 12.5 mg versus placebo (adjusted mean difference = -7.51 mm, 95% CI = -13.40 to -1.62; p = .013). Paroxetine CR doses of 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day are effective in treating PMDD and are well tolerated. At end point, subjects treated with paroxetine CR (12.5 mg and 25 mg) demonstrated significant improvement in VAS-Mood scores compared with those who received placebo (paroxetine CR 12.5 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -8.7 mm; 95% CI, -15.7, -1.7; p =.015; paroxetine CR 25 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -12.1 mm; 95% CI, -18.9, -5.3; p <.001). Both doses of paroxetine CR 12.5 mg and 25 mg daily are effective and well tolerated in patients who suffer from PMDD. Of these agents, sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine (as an extended-release formulation) are approved by the US FDA for luteal phase, as well as continuous, administration. In well designed placebo-controlled trials in patients with major depressive disorder (including a study in the elderly), social anxiety disorder or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), paroxetine CR was consistently superior to placebo with regards to primary endpoints (i.e. mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score [major depressive disorder], Liebowitz social anxiety scale total score and Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement score [social anxiety disorder] and Visual Analogue Scale-Mood score [PMDD]). Paroxetine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive- compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. Studies having compared the efficiency of antidepressants according to their serotonin activity (paroxetine or sertraline versus maprotiline, that is a selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor), showed that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors were significantly more efficient on all symptoms than maprotiline, that was not more efficient than placebo. Paroxetine is a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with currently approved indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. Preliminary data suggest that paroxetine has potential in the treatment of social phobia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. The effects of active treatment were marked by the first active cycle with luteal phase 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores decreasing from 14.9 (+/- 5.3) to 8.2 (+/- 4.9) in the first, 7.8 (+/- 5.1) in the second, and 7.8 (+/- 6.8) in the third active treatment cycles (F[1,13] = 17.6; p < 0.0001). The most conservative measure, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), revealed that 7 of 14 patients had a complete response (CGI = 1 or 2) whereas 4 patients had a partial response (CGI = 3). These open trial findings are consistent with the notion that paroxetine is effective in the acute phase for the treatment of PDD. The rating of premenstrual irritability, depressed mood, increase in appetite, and anxiety/tension was markedly lower during treatment with paroxetine than before, and this reduction in symptomatology appeared unabated for the entire treatment period."
Isn't cadasil syndrome a hereditary disease?,no,"CADASIL is the most frequent hereditary small-vessel disease of the brain. The clinical impact of various MR imaging markers has been repeatedly studied in this disorder, but alterations of contrast between gray matter and normal-appearing white matter remain unknown.

Do U6-associated proteins Lsm4 and Lsm6 interact with SMN?,yes,"SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6.  Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6 Furthermore, we present evidence for two separate binding sites in SMN for Sm/Lsm proteins. Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6.  Symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues in spliceosomal Sm protein B/B' and the Sm-like protein LSm4, and their interaction with the SMN protein. Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domain of Lsm4 directly interacts with SMN. This entity promotes the binding of a set of factors, termed LSm/Sm proteins, onto snRNA to form the core structure of these particles.  Toward an assembly line for U7 snRNPs: interactions of U7-specific Lsm proteins with PRMT5 and SMN complexes. In this report, we demonstrate that the coilin C-terminal domain binds directly to various Sm and Lsm proteins via their Sm motifs. We show that the region of coilin responsible for this binding activity is separable from that which binds to SMN. Thus, the ability to interact with free Sm (and Lsm) proteins as well as with intact snRNPs, indicates that coilin and CBs may facilitate the modification of newly formed snRNPs, the regeneration of 'mature' snRNPs, or the reclamation of unassembled snRNP components. Moreover this structure has important consequences for snRNP assembly that is mediated by two complexes containing the PRMT5 methyltransferase and the SMN (survival of motor neurons) protein, respectively. Arginine/glycine (RG)-rich domains in components of the SMN complex interact with Sm, like-Sm (LSm), fibrillarin, RNA helicase A (Gu), and coilin proteins, all of which are antigen targets in a variety of diseases."
Isn't overproduction of transthyretin is associated with amyloidosis associated neuropathy?,no,"Transthyretin-associated familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is a disease caused by the deposit of abnormal transthyretin on tissues, mainly nerves transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy We report a new transthyretin (ATTR) gene c.272C>G mutation and variant protein, p.Leu32Val, in a kindred of Bolivian origin with a rapid progressive peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopat Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, first described in families with sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. Abnormal deposition of aggregated wild-type (WT) human transthyretin (TTR) and its pathogenic variants is responsible for cardiomyopathy and neuropathy related to TTR amyloidosis.  Transthyretin (TTR), normally a plasma circulating protein, can become misfolded and aggregated, ultimately leading to extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils usually targeted to heart or nerve tissues. Referred to as TTR-associated amyloidoses (ATTR), this group of diseases is frequently life threatening and fatal if untreated Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, first described in families with sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is usually characterised by a progressive peripheral and autonomic neuropathy often with associated cardiac failure and is due to dominantly inherited transthyretin mutations causing accelerated amyloid deposition."
Are ACTA1 (alpha actin) and NEB (nebulin) genes related to nemaline myopathy?,yes,"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a group of congenital myopathies, characterized by the presence of distinct rod-like inclusions ""nemaline bodies"" in the sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle fibers. To date, ACTA1, NEB, TPM3, TPM2, TNNT1, and CFL2 have been found to cause NM. Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). 20-25% of NM cases carry ACTA1 defects and these particular mutations usually induce substitutions of single residues in the actin protein.  Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a genetically and clinically heterogenous muscle disorder, which is myopathologically characterized by nemaline bodies. Mutations in six genes have been reported to cause NM: Nebulin (NEB Pelin 1999), alpha-skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1 Nowak 1999), alpha-slow tropomyosin (TPM3 Laing 1995), beta-tropomyosin (TPM2 Donner 2002), slow troponin T (TNNT1 Johnston 2000) and cofilin 2 (CFL2 Agrawal 2007). The majority of cases are due to mutation in NEB and ACTA1.  Nemaline myopathy is a heterogenous form of congenital myopathy characterised by a variable spectrum of clinical features, predominated in the severe form by profound muscle hypotonia and weakness accompanied by respiratory insufficiency. The clinical variability, with differing age of onset and severity of symptoms makes the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy difficult in some cases. Severe forms of nemaline myopathy may be caused by mutation of a number of different genes: skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1), nebulin (NEB) and alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3), all of which encode components of the sarcomeric thin filaments of skeletal muscle.  Most nemaline myopathy patients have mutations in the nebulin (NEB) or skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) genes.  We report muscle MRI findings of 10 patients from 8 families with nemaline myopathy. Patients with involvement of the nebulin (NEB) gene showed a consistent pattern of selective muscle involvement corresponding to clinical severity. Patients with nemaline myopathy secondary to mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) gene showed diffuse involvement of thigh and leg muscles with relative sparing of the gastrocnemii. Congenital myopathies are clinical and genetic heterogeneous disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness ranging in severity. Three major forms have been identified: actin myopathy, intranuclear rod myopathy, and nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy is the most common of these myopathies and is further subdivided into seven groups according to severity, progressiveness, and age of onset. At present, five genes have been linked to congenital myopathies. These include alpha-actin (ACTA1), alpha- and beta-tropomyosin (TPM3 and TPM2), troponin T (TNNT1), and nebulin (NEB).  Nemaline myopathy is a structural congenital myopathy which may show both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. Mutations in three different genes have been identified as the cause of nemaline myopathy: the gene for slow alpha-tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) at 1q22-23, the nebulin gene (NEB) at 2q21.1-q22, and the actin gene (ACTA1) at 1q42. Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. The clinical spectrum ranges from severe cases with antenatal or neonatal onset and early death to late onset cases with only slow progression. Three genes are known to cause nemaline myopathy: the genes for nebulin (NEB) on chromosome 2q22, slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3) on chromosome 1q21 and skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) on chromosome 1q42.  Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). Three genes are known to cause nemaline myopathy: the genes for nebulin (NEB) on chromosome 2q22, slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3) on chromosome 1q21 and skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) on chromosome 1q42. Five genes have now been associated with nemaline myopathy: alpha-tropomyosin-3 (TPM3), alpha-actin (ACTA1), nebulin (NEB), beta-tropomysin (TPM2) and troponin T (TNNT1). Most nemaline myopathy patients have mutations in the nebulin (NEB) or skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) genes.

Is there any role of 5hmC in T-cell development and differentiation?,yes,"We have mapped 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at different stages of T-cell development in the thymus and T-cell differentiation in the periphery. We show that 5hmC is enriched in the gene body of highly expressed genes at all developmental stages and that its presence correlates positively with gene expression. Further emphasizing the connection with gene expression, we find that 5hmC is enriched in active thymus-specific enhancers and that genes encoding key transcriptional regulators display high intragenic 5hmC levels in precursor cells at those developmental stages where they exert a positive effect. Our data constitute a valuable resource that will facilitate detailed analysis of the role of 5hmC in T-cell development and differentiation. We show that 5hmC is enriched in the gene body of highly expressed genes at all developmental stages and that its presence correlates positively with gene expression.

We show that 5hmC is enriched in the gene body of highly expressed genes at all developmental stages and that its presence correlates positively with gene expression. Here, we report early and widespread 5mC/5hmC remodeling during human CD4(+) T cell differentiation ex vivo at genes and cell-specific enhancers with known T cell function. Our results support 5hmC-mediated DNA de-methylation as a key component of CD4(+) T cell biology in humans, with important implications for gene regulation and lineage commitment. 5hmC plays important roles in regulation of gene expression and differentiation and has been implicated in T cell malignancies and autoimmunity."
Aren't genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?,yes,"Genomic DNA is used as the template for both replication and transcription, whose machineries may collide and result in mutagenesis, among other damages. Because head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, genes should be preferentially encoded on the leading strand to avoid head-on collisions, as is observed in most bacterial genomes examined. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand remarkable strand-bias of the distribution of essential genes Head-on encounters between the replication and transcription machineries on the lagging DNA strand can lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and replication are co-directional. Replication-associated purine asymmetry may contribute to strand-biased gene distribution. strand-biased gene distribution (SGD) SGD correlates not only with polC, but also with purine asymmetry (PAS) In bacteria, most genes are on the leading strand of replication, a phenomenon attributed to collisions between the DNA and RNA polymerases. genes whose expression is important for fitness are selected to the leading strand because this reduces the duration of these interruptions Among prokaryotic genomes, the distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork is known to be biased.  We show that the evidence they provided is invalid and that the existence of lagging strand encoded genes is explainable by a balance between deleterious mutations that bring genes from the leading to the lagging strand and purifying selection purging such mutants. Based on those experimentally determined for 10 bacteria, we find that essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand, for all the 10 genomes studied, confirming previous findings based on either smaller datasets or putatively assigned ones by homology search. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This paradox could be explained by assuming that the stronger mutation pressure and selection after inversion preferentially eliminate genes transferred from the leading to the lagging DNA strand. We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under experimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and the elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the leading/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome"

Isn't desmin an intermediate filament protein involved in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)?,no,"Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy (DRM) is a cardiac and skeletal muscle disease caused by mutations in the desmin (DES) gene. Mutations in the central 2B domain of DES cause skeletal muscle disease that typically precedes cardiac involvement. However, the prevalence of DES mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without skeletal muscle disease is not known. The lack of severe disruption of cytoskeletal desmin network formation seen with mutations in the 1A and tail domains suggests that dysfunction of seemingly intact desmin networks is sufficient to cause DCM. According to the predominant view, desmin mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated a family with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) associated with a novel desmin mutation and reviewed recent reports regarding the frequency of RCM in patients with desmin myopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by enlargement and dilation of all heart compartments associated with serious decrease of its contractile function. DCM hallmark is the combination of dystrophic and hypertrophic alterations of cardiomyocytes. Since the power output of cardiac cells is directly related to remodeling of their contractile machinery we investigated expression of selected contractile and cytoskeletal proteins in the left ventricle of DCM patients using immunoblotting. The content of the recognized protein markers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy such as tubulin, desmin and slow skeletal myosin heavy chain isoform, MHCbeta, was significantly elevated in DCM compared to normal myocardium. In contrast, overexpression of desmin filaments by itself is not detrimental to the heart. Although loss-of-function studies have been more limited, ablation of the desmin gene causes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, resulting in cardiomyopathy in mice. From function studies, abnormal desmin aggregation and disruption of the desmin networks resulting from expression of either mutant desmin or mutant CryAB have been shown to remodel the heart and compromise cardiac function, suggesting their synergistic roles in disease pathogenesis. A missense mutation in the desmin gene (DES) causes DCM in a human family. Mice deficient in desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate filament gene family, display defects in all muscle types and particularly in the myocardium. Desmin null hearts develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by extensive myocyte cell death, calcific fibrosis and multiple ultrastructural defects. Several lines of evidence suggest impaired vascular function in desmin null animals. Familial DCM is commonly inherited as autosomal dominant trait; less frequently it is autosomal recessive, X-linked or matrilinear. The disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Genes causally linked to this phenotype include dystrophin, dystrophin-associated glycoproteins, actin, desmin, beta-miosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, and mitochondrial DNA genes, mostly transfer RNAs. Examination of families has identified so far eight disease genes, namely the dystrophin, tafazzin, cardiac actin, desmin, lamin A/C, delta- sarcoglycan, cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain, and cardiac troponin T gene. Mutations of the desmin,   delta-sarcoglycan, the cardiac actin and beta-myosin heavy chain as well as the troponin T gene are known to cause autosomal dominant-dilated cardiomyopathy without other abnormalities. Autosomal dominant DCM is the most frequent form (56% of our cases), and several candidate disease loci have been identified by linkage analysis. Three disease genes are presently known: the cardiac actin gene, the desmin gene, and the lamin A/C gene. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Two genes have been identified for the X-linked forms (dystrophin and tafazzin), whereas three other genes (actin, lamin A/C, and desmin) cause autosomal dominant DCM; Desmin defects were also recently identified in 1 familial dilated cardiomyopathy. By candidate gene screening, the molecular diagnosis can be provided for dystrophin, DAG, mitochondrial DNA, actin and desmin gene defects. Desmin (z-bands) are partly destroyed in DCM. Anti-desmin antibody titers as indicators of a possible secondary immune response are found high in patients with acute myocarditis declining during reconvalescence and are also elevated in DCM.  Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, is a major target in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans and mice Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament, is involved in myofibrillar myopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle wasting"
Are there any HCV replication inhibitors available?,yes,"We report here the discovery of the first small-molecule HCV infectivity inhibitor, GS-563253, also called HCV infectivity inhibitor 1 (HCV II-1).  Resistance to mericitabine (prodrug of HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor PSI-6130) is rare and conferred by the NS5B S282T mutation. We tested the ability of NA808 to inhibit SPT's enzymatic activity in FLR3-1 replicon cells The SPT inhibitor NA808 prevents replication of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a in cultured hepatocytes and in mice with humanized livers. Vaniprevir (phase III clinical trials) and MK-5172 (phase II clinical trials) are two potent antiviral compounds that target NS3/4A protease treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been significantly improved with the approval of the first two HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir (Incivek) and boceprevir (Victrelis).  Combination therapy with telaprevir and BMS-788329 (NS5A inhibitor) reduced serum HCV RNA to undetectable levels. The presence of an NS3-V36A telaprevir resistance mutation resulted in poor response to telaprevir monotherapy but showed significant HCV reduction when telaprevir was combined with BMS-788329. However, a BMS-788329-resistant strain emerged at low frequency. Infection with a BMS-788329-resistant NS5A-L31V mutation rapidly resulted in gain of an additional NS5A-Y93A mutation that conferred telaprevir resistance during combination therapy HCV NS5A replication complex inhibitors, exemplified by Daclatasvir (BMS-790052), represent a new class of DAA ACH-806 (or GS-9132) is a novel, small-molecule inhibitor specific for hepatitis C virus (HCV).  Telaprevir and boceprevir are the first two protease inhibitor (PI) DAAs to be approved for combination therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV).  symmetrical bidentate structure of the NS5A inhibitor BMS-790052, a series of new monodentate molecules were designed In vitro, boceprevir is more active than telaprevir against the HCV G3 NS3/4A enzyme in cell-based and biochemical assays and against G3 isolates in replicon assays Alisporivir is the most advanced host-targeting antiviral in clinical development. Alisporivir blocks HCV replication by neutralizing the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of the abundant host cytosolic protein, cyclophilin A Interestingly, the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir (BMS-790052) caused a decrease in serum HCV RNA levels by about two orders of magnitude within 6 h of administration"
Doesn't do MVIIA and MVIIC bind to the same calcium channel?,yes,"We examined the post-pubertal behavioral effects of neonatal (postnatal day 7) medial prefrontal cortex infusion of either vehicle or N-type and P/Q-type presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers (omega-conotoxins MVIIA and MVIIC respectively; 6.8 and 45 pmol infused respectively) in rat pups. Additionally, the number of binding sites for radioligands labelling L- ([3H]nitrendipine), N- ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIA) and P/Q-type ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIC) Ca2+ channels was assessed in the rat retina and, for further comparison, in the rat cortex. Omega-conotoxin MVIIC (MVIIC) blocks P/Q-type calcium channels with high affinity and N-type calcium channels with low affinity, while the highly homologous omega-conotoxin MVIIA blocks only N-type calcium channels. However, omega-conotoxin MVIIC seems to bind to sites different from those recognised by omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA, which are markedly differentiated by their Ca2+ requirements for binding to their receptors. Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively. Replacement of the N-terminal half of omega-conotoxin MVIIC, a peptide blocker of P/Q-type calcium channels, with that of omega-conotoxin MVIIA significantly increased the affinity for N-type calcium channels.  Omega-conotoxin MVIIC (MVIIC) blocks P/Q-type calcium channels with high affinity and N-type calcium channels with low affinity, while the highly homologous omega-conotoxin MVIIA blocks only N-type calcium channels. We wished to obtain MVIIC analogues more selective for P/Q-type calcium channels than MVIIC to elucidate structural differences among the channels, which discriminate the omega-conotoxins. omega-conotoxin MVIIC seems to bind to sites different from those recognised by omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA,"
Can zinc finger nucleases be used to combat disease?,yes,"Genetic engineering has emerged as a powerful mechanism for understanding biological systems and a potential approach for redressing congenital disease. This is of particular importance, given the momentum currently behind ZFNs in moving into phase I clinical trials. This study provides a historical account of the origins of ZFN technology, an analysis of current techniques and applications, and an examination of the ethical issues applicable to translational ZFN genetic engineering in early phase clinical trials. This broad range of tractable species renders ZFNs a useful tool for improving the understanding of complex physiological systems, to produce transgenic animals, cell lines, and plants, and to treat human disease. We observe comparably high frequencies in human T cells, raising the possibility of strategies based on zinc-finger nucleases for the treatment of disease. Using engineered nucleases, such as Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) or Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs), to make targeted genomic modifications has become a common technique to create new model organisms and custom cell lines, and has shown great promise for disease treatment.

Isn't protein CXCR4 used as a prognostic marker of cancer?,no,"Aberrant overexpression of CXCR4 is associated with worse overall survival, adenocarcinoma histology, distant metastasis, lymph node involvement in NSCLC. CXCR4 belongs to a family of G protein-coupled cell surface receptors and has been proved to a prognostic marker in a various tumors, including esophageal squamous cell cancer.  The chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been found to be a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, being involved in chemotaxis, stemness and drug resistance.  The chemokine receptor CXCR4 that has been shown to be implicated in PDAC tumorigenicity and aggressiveness could serve as a prognostic marker for survival after a curative-intent surgery and was associated with the pattern of tumour recurrence (distant versus local relapse). XCR4 promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis, and is a prognostic marker in a number of different types of tumors. CXCR4 has been identified as a prognostic marker for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other malignancies.  The chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been found to be a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, including breast cancer.  Upregulated expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 is an independent prognostic predictor for patients with gastric cancer. detection of CXCR4 expression will be helpful for predicting prognosis for patients with gastric cancer. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a marker of metastatic disease. High CXCR4 level in cancer specimens independently predicts a poor outcome for patients with node-positive breast cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the high levels of nuclear CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression in hepatocytes were significantly better prognostic factors for overall and hepatic disease-free survival in patients with CLM. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been implicated in sarcoma development and has been found to be a prognostic marker for poor clinical outcome.  high CXCR4 expression is correlated to shorter DFS and could be used as a prognostic marker in order to stratify melanoma patients at higher progression risk."
Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,yes,"The hypocholesterolemic effect of tomato juice has been investigated in an intervention study with rats, along with the possible inhibition effect of bioactive tomato compounds binding to the HMGCR enzyme. The molecular modelling showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCR.  Juice consumption significantly improved resistance of LDL+VLDL-C to Cu(2+)-mediated oxidation (P = 0.039), HDL-C (47.3 ± 15.8 to 51.7 ± 14.8 mg/dL, P<0.001), and the ratio of total-C/HDL-C (4.25 ± 1.59 to 3.63 ± 1.16, P<0.001) at 8 wk. RESULTS: Intervention with the enriched juice had no effect on the lipid profile, and serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL) remained unchanged.  Women consuming ≥10 compared with<1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L; P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P<0.001) in multivariable models. Considering clinical cutpoints, women consuming ≥10 compared with<1.5 servings/wk were 31% (95% CI = 6%, 50%), 40% (95% CI = 13%, 59%), and 66% (95% CI = 20%, 86%) less likely to have elevated TC (≥6.21 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol (≥4.14 mmol/L), and hemoglobin A1c (≥6%), respectively.  In conclusion, women consuming ≥10 compared with<1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had clinically modest but significant improvements in TC, the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio, and hemoglobin A1c but not other coronary biomarkers. Tomato juice decreases LDL cholesterol levels and increases LDL resistance to oxidation. Total cholesterol concentration was reduced by 5.9 (sd 10) % (P = 0.002) and LDL cholesterol concentration by 12.9 (sd 17.0) % (P = 0.0002) with the high tomato diet compared to the low tomato diet. In conclusion, a high dietary intake of tomato products had atheroprotective effects, it significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels, and increased LDL resistance to oxidation in healthy normocholesterolaemic adults. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice Total cholesterol concentration was reduced by 5.9 (sd 10) % (P = 0.002) and LDL cholesterol concentration by 12.9 (sd 17.0) % (P = 0.0002) with the high tomato diet compared to the low tomato diet."
Is CD84 genetically associated with arthritis?,yes,"The SNP is predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding site motifs in the 3' UTR of an immune-related gene, CD84, and the allele associated with better response to etanercept was associated with higher CD84 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P = 1 × 10(-11) in 228 non-RA patients and P = 0.004 in 132 RA patients) Our study demonstrates that an allele associated with response to etanercept therapy is also associated with CD84 gene expression, and further that CD84 expression correlates with disease activity  Three members of this gene family, Ly108, Ly9, and CD84, exhibit polymorphisms that strongly influence susceptibility to systemic autoimmunity, notably in mice, but also in some human populations"
Isn't there any role of interleukin-11 in cardiovascular fibrosis?,no,"IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis. Using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, we found that Interleukin 11 (IL11) upregulation is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFB1 exposure and required for its profibrotic effect. IL11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts where they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 is protective against disease. Thus, inhibition of IL11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These data reveal a central role of IL11 in fibrosis and we propose inhibition of IL11 as a new therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases. IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis."
Is microRNA(miRNA) 30 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,yes,"The myocardium of the failing heart undergoes a number of structural alterations, most notably hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes and an increase in extracellular matrix proteins, often seen as primary fibrosi Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a key molecule in the process of fibrosis and therefore seems an attractive therapeutic target CTGF is importantly regulated by 2 major cardiac microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-133 and miR-30. the expression of both miRNAs was inversely related to the amount of CTGF in 2 rodent models of heart disease and in human pathological left ventricular hypertrophy. Second, in cultured cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, knockdown of these miRNAs increased CTGF levels. Third, overexpression of miR-133 or miR-30c decreased CTGF levels, which was accompanied by decreased production of collagens. miR-30 importantly limit the production of CTGF miR-30 directly downregulate CTGF, a key profibrotic protein, and thereby establish an important role for these miRNAs in the control of structural changes in the extracellular matrix of the myocardium."
Does physical activity influence gut hormones?,yes,"Increases in blood PYY(3-36) levels were dependent on the exercise intensity (effect of session: P<0.001 by two-way ANOVA), whereas those in GLP-1 levels were similar between two different exercise sessions. A decrease in serum leptin levels (-48.4%, p < 0.001) was observed after intervention without changes in total peptide YY and insulin levels. ur data suggest that the control of spontaneous physical activity by gut hormones or their neuropeptide targets may represent an important mechanistic component of energy balance regulation Hunger and gut hormones remained unchanged during the bed rest. weight-bearing exercise has a greater exercise-induced appetite suppressive effect compared with non-weight-bearing exercise, and both forms of exercise lowered acylated ghrelin and increased total PYY, but the changes did not differ significantly between exercise modes. Appetite (P < 0.0005) and acylated ghrelin (P < 0.002) were suppressed during exercise but more so during SIE. Peptide YY increased during exercise but most consistently during END (P < 0.05). Acylated ghrelin was lowest in the afternoon of SIE (P = 0.018) despite elevated appetite Following the pre-exercise meal, ghrelin was suppressed ~17% and insulin and PYY were elevated ~157 and ~40%, respectively, relative to fasting (day 7). Following exercise, PYY, ghrelin, and GH were significantly (p < 0.0001) increased by ~11, ~16 and ~813%, respectively. The noted disruption in the typical inverse relationship between ghrelin and PYY following exercise suggests that interaction of these peptides may be at least partially responsible for post-exercise appetite suppression Plasma levels of PYY and GLP-1 were increased by exercise, whereas plasma ghrelin levels were unaffected by exercise These findings suggest ghrelin and PYY may regulate appetite during and after exercise, significant (P < 0.05) interaction effects for hunger, acylated ghrelin, and PYY, indicating suppressed hunger and acylated ghrelin during aerobic and resistance exercise and increased PYY during aerobic exercise 'exercise-induced anorexia' may potentially be linked to increased PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels. Hunger scores and PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels showed an inverse temporal pattern during the 1-h exercise/control intervention Exercise significantly increased mean PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels, and this effect was maintained during the post-exercise period for GLP-1 and PP. No significant effect of exercise was observed on postprandial levels of ghrelin following blood donation the strenuous exercise resulted in a marked reduction in the plasma leptin We conclude that strenuous physical exercise; 1) fails to affect plasma leptin level but when performed after meal but not after blood withdrawal it results in an increase and fall in plasma leptin, and 2) the release of gut hormones (gastrin, CCK and PP) and stress hormones (norepinephrine, cortisol, GH) increase immediately after exercise independently of feeding or blood donation the unrestricted exercise group has a significantly elevated SRIF-LI concentration Exercise has recently been reported to influence ghrelin and PYY concentrations."
Hasn't overexpression of sirtuins been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)?,no,"In addition, Sir2 overexpression prevents Rif1 deletion from disrupting Sir2 at IGS1 and shortening lifespan.  Roles for sirtuin proteins at telomeres are thought to promote lifespan in yeast and mammals. Overexpression of sirtuins (NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases) has been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) When overexpressed, the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase Sir2 extends the lifespan of both budding yeast  When overexpressed in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), SIRT1 antagonizes PML-induced acetylation of p53 and rescues PML-mediated premature cellular senescence."
Is corpus callosum involved in the Mowat–Wilson syndrome?,yes,"The syndrome is characterized by typical facial features, moderate-to-severe mental retardation, epilepsy and variable congenital malformations, including Hirschsprung disease, genital anomalies, congenital heart disease, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and eye defects.  Mowat-Wilson syndrome in a fetus with antenatal diagnosis of short corpus callosum: advocacy for standard autopsy. It is mainly characterized by moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, facial dysmorphism and various malformations including Hirschsprung disease and corpus callosum anomalies.  The association of a corpus callosum hypoplasia with a histological Hirschsprung disease and a typical facial gestalt allowed the guiding of genetic testing. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a severe intellectual disability (ID)-distinctive facial gestalt-multiple congenital anomaly syndrome, commonly associating microcephaly, epilepsy, corpus callosum agenesis, conotruncal heart defects, urogenital malformations and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR).  Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is characterized by severe mental retardation with seizures, specific facial dysmorphism, Hirschsprung disease, anomalies of the corpus callosum, and genitourinary and cardiac malformations. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a genetic disease caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions of the ZEB2 gene and is characterized by distinctive facial features, epilepsy, moderate to severe intellectual disability, corpus callosum abnormalities and other congenital malformations. The striking facial phenotype in addition to other features such as severely impaired speech, hypotonia, microcephaly, short stature, seizures, corpus callosum agenesis, congenital heart defects, hypospadias, and Hirschsprung disease are particularly important clues for the initial clinical diagnosis.  Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a distinct facial appearance, moderate-to-severe mental retardation, microcephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, Hirschsprung disease, congenital heart disease, and genital anomalies.  It is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance in association with intellectual disability (ID) and variable other features including agenesis of the corpus callosum, seizures, congenital heart defects, microcephaly, short stature, hypotonia, and Hirschsprung disease.

Can't tetracycline affect tooth formation?,no,"he results of that study, reported earlier (Rebich et al., 1983), indicated that over one-fifth of the American Indian children had discoloration of the dentition due to ingestion of tetracycline during the years of tooth formatio ale Wistar rats prelabeled with tetracycline to mark surfaces of bone and tooth formation-mineralization were placed into orbit for 18.5 days aboard the Soviet COSMOS-1129 Biosatellit It was concluded that the increased tetracycline incorporation reflected a higher rate of mineralization associated with faster tooth formation in the unimpeded toot n this investigation an attempt has been made to determine the relationship between the staining of permanent teeth by tetracycline administered during the period of tooth formation with the dosage of the drug and the duration of therap  definite relationship between total dosage and staining and duration of administration and staining was established; the condition occurred with greater frequency (in more than one-third of the children) when the total dosage exceeded 3 g. or the duration of treatment was longer than 10 days This case report suggests the possibility that discoloration from tetracycline may not be limited to tooth development in the child, but may also affect the adult dentition"
Isn't intense physical activity associated with longevity ?,no,"We found a very significant increase in average longevity (17%) of the cyclists when compared with the general population. The age at which 50% of the general population died was 73.5 vs. 81.5 years in Tour de France participants. Our major finding is that repeated very intense exercise prolongs life span in well trained practitioners. Competitive exercise does not induce cardiac damage in individuals with healthy hearts, but does induce physiological functional and structural cardiac adaptations which have positive effects on life expectancy. Medallists lived an average of 2.8 years longer than controls. Medallists in eight of the nine country groups had a significant survival advantage compared with controls. Gold, silver, and bronze medallists each enjoyed similar sized survival advantages. Medallists in endurance sports and mixed sports had a larger survival advantage over controls at 30 years (1.13, 1.09 to 1.17; 1.11, 1.09 to 1.13) than that of medallists in power sports (1.05, 1.01 to 1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Olympic medallists live longer than the general population, irrespective of country, medal, or sport. This study was not designed to explain this effect, but possible explanations include genetic factors, physical activity, healthy lifestyle, and the wealth and status that come with international sporting glory. Long-term endurance training induces in elderly subjects an increased HRV and a higher exercise working capacity, which are well-established predictors of cardiovascular and overall mortality. Sports activity in adolescents and young adults was associated with an increased risk of SD, both in males and females. Sports, per se, was not a cause of the enhanced mortality, but it triggered SD in those athletes who were affected by cardiovascular conditions predisposing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during physical exercise."
Can mutations in Calmodulin cause ventricular fibrillation?,yes,"We characterized a family presenting with a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden death without ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities at rest. Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years, and another two were resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with documented VF at age 10 and 16, respectively. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue (p.Phe90Leu) in the CALM1 gene encoding calmodulin. This mutation was also carried by one of the sibs who died suddenly, for whom DNA was available. The mutation was present in the mother and in an sibling, both asymptomatic but displaying a marginally prolonged QT-interval during exercise. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a mutation in CALM1 underlying IVF manifesting in childhood and adolescence. The causality of the mutation is supported by previous studies demonstrating that Phe90 mediates the direct interaction of CaM with target peptides Here we show that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein, binds to the carboxy-terminal 'IQ' domain of the human cardiac Na channel (hH1) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This binding interaction significantly enhances slow inactivation-a channel-gating process linked to life-threatening idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. Mutations targeted to the IQ domain disrupted CaM binding and eliminated Ca2+/CaM-dependent slow inactivation, whereas the gating effects of Ca2+/CaM were restored by intracellular application of a peptide modelled after the IQ domain."
Doesn't deflazacort have more side effects than prednisone?,yes,"Though Deflazacort and prednisone improve clinical endpoints in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, Deflazacort produces fewer side effects."
Does amiodarone affect thyroid hormone receptors in the myocardium?,yes,"AM and Dron affected TR expression in the RA similarly by decreasing TRalpha 1 and beta 1 expression by about 50% In the LVW, AM and Dron decreased TRbeta 1 and, interestingly, AM increased TRalpha 1. n the apex, AM also increased TRalpha 2. Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in comparison to the control. amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse myocardium in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed no change in the expression of the ThR protein. Amiodarone and T3, respectively, downregulated T3R alpha 1, T3R beta 1, T3R beta 2 (p < 0.05), but did not affect the levels of T3R alpha 2. Amiodarone and T3, added together, upregulated T3R alpha 2 and T3R beta 1 (p < 0.05) as compared to amiodarone or T3 alone."
Aren't seizures among the neurological symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti?,no,"High-dose glucocorticoid therapy in the management of seizures in neonatal incontinentia pigmenti Incontinentia pigmenti is an X-linked dominant disorder resulting from a mutation of IKBKG. This disorder has a classic dermatologic presentation, but neurologic involvement, with seizures and cortical infarction, can arise shortly after birth Some children with incontinentia pigmenti exhibit encephalopathic features with severe seizures and disturbed consciousness, from the neonatal through the early infantile period Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked dominant neurocutaneous disorder affecting ectodermal tissue: skin, eyes, central nervous system, hair, nails, and teeth. It is usually lethal for males in utero. The involved gene is NEMO, an essential component of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Skin lesions are highly diagnostic, occurring in neonates, with a particular distribution on Blaschko lines. The severity of the disease is related to ocular and neurological impairment. The hallmark of ocular IP is retinal vasculopathy including peripheral retinal vascular nonperfusion, macular infarction and neovascularization, and preretinal neovascularization. CNS involvement consists of seizures, mental retardation, hemiparesis, spasticity, microcephaly, cerebellar ataxia, and coma Incontinentia Pigmenti is a rare X-linked multisystem disorder with well described and pathognomonic skin manifestations. Neurological manifestations are found in 30% of IP patients, forming one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality of the condition.

disease ibd they are characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract significantly impacting on patient quality of life and often requiring prolonged treatment existing therapies for ibd are not effective for all patients and an unmet need exists for additional therapies to induce and maintain remission here we describe the mechanism of action of the janus kinase jak inhibitor tofacitinib for the treatment of ibd and the effect of jak inhibition on the chronic cycle of inflammation that is characteristic of the disease the pathogenesis of ibd involves a dysfunctional response from the innate and adaptive immune system resulting in overexpression of multiple inflammatory cytokines many of which signal through jaks thus jak inhibition allows multiple cytokine signaling pathways to be targeted and is expected to modulate the innate and adaptive immune response in ibd thereby interrupting the cycle of inflammation tofacitinib is an oral small molecule jak inhibitor that is being investigated as a targeted immunomodulator for ibd clinical development of tofacitinib and other jak inhibitors is ongoing with the aspiration of providing new treatment options for ibd that have the potential to deliver prolonged efficacy and clinically meaningful patient benefits."
Is butterfly rash a symptom of Systemic lupus erythematosus?,yes,"Diagnosing SLE can be challenging because of the myriad of clinical features and substantial variability between patients. Cutaneous involvement is present in about 60% of cases and typically manifests as a malar or butterfly rash. The prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is 28 per 100,000.  We report a 12 years old female patient with an overlap syndrome involving autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient presented with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, malaise, polyarthralgia, arthritis and butterfly rash on the face. Some of the clinical characteristics of SLE patients observed were nephritis (53.7%), fever (53.26%), neuropsychological disorder (36.18%), malar/butterfly rash (27.6%), pulmonary disorder (22.6%), photosensitivity (21.6%), cardiac involvement (21.1%) and oral ulcers (19.09%).  Systemic lupus erythematosus and infections: a retrospective study in Saudis. The prevalence of the following manifestations was significantly higher for pediatric than for adult-onset disease including: lupus nephritis (43% pediatric vs 26.4% for adult-onset), hematological disorders (57% vs 36.4%), photosensitivity (20% vs 9%), butterfly rash (61% vs 35.5%) and mucosal ulceration (11.4% vs 4%).  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease with highest prevalence among women of childbearing age.  We described a unique case of a 25-year-old Arab young woman who was diagnosed with SLE, depending on clinical, laboratory investigations and after she had fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for SLE and had presented the following findings: constitutional findings (fatigue, fever, and arthralgia); dermatologic finding (photosensitivity and butterfly rash); chronic renal failure (proteinuria up to 400 mg in 24 hours); hematologic and antinuclear antibodies (positivity for antinuclear factor (ANF), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, direct Coombs, ANA and anti-DNA, low C4 and C3, aCL by IgG and IgM).  Grade 1 and 2-3 inflammatory process occurred in 53 (63%) and 31 (37%) patients respectively. Symptom complexes ""systemic inflammation"", ""butterfly rash"", ""wrist petechiae"", ""enanthema of the oral mucous membrane"", and other lesions were regarded as the markers of SLE activity.  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains a challenging medical problem.  Rembrandt's Maria Bockenolle has a butterfly rash and digital deformities: overlapping syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. A butterfly rash on the patient's face suggested a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A butterfly rash on the patients face suggested a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) The diagnosis of SLE could be excluded and the butterfly rash attributed to a laminar hemorrhage, an ecchymosis due to the autoimmune thrombocytopenia. We describe a case of KD who developed a typical butterfly rash, reminiscent of SLE.  The diagnosis of SLE was made 22 years ago based on Raynaud's phenomenon, butterfly rash, hair loss, photosensitivity and positive antinuclear antibody.  Symptom complexes ""systemic inflammation"", ""butterfly rash"", ""wrist petechiae"", ""enanthema of the oral mucous membrane"", and other lesions were regarded as the markers of SLE activity.

Is myasthenia gravis associated with osteoporosis?,yes,"We performed PVP in 4 patients with generalized MG associated with recent steroid-induced symptomatic VFs.  In this case report, we used tacrolimus to successfully treat a 13-year-old boy with ocular MG who had suffered from severe steroid complications, including a failure of thrive and osteoporosis.  INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk.  RESULTS: Compared to the control cohort, there was no statistically significant increased risk observed in patients with MG for any fracture (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.11; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.47) or osteoporotic fractures (AHR 0.98 [95 % CI 0.67-1.41]). Further, use of oral glucocorticoids up to a cumulative dose exceeding 5 g prednisolone equivalents did not increase risk of osteoporotic fracture (AHR 0.99 [95 % CI, 0.31-3.14]) compared with MG patients without glucocorticoid exposure. The RANKL/OPG ratio and indices of bone metabolisms are also not affected by THX, although THX increases the levels of IL-7 and RANKL. Both disorders had been controlled for around 15 years by oral prednisolone and a cholinesterase inhibitor following surgical removal of invasive thymoma and radiotherapy, but muscular weakness due to myalgia and an increase in serum levels of myogenic enzymes, mainly ascribable to the recurrence of PM, reappeared immediately after cessation of these drugs, which was done because the patient had multiple bone fractures and severe osteoporosis due to the long-term corticosteroid therapy.  We measured bone density in 36 patients (26 females and 10 males) who had undergone long-term prednisolone administration, and found a decrease in bone density in 31% of female patients and osteoporosis in only 11.5% (three cases). In conclusion, prednisolone-treated patients with myasthenia gravis have an acceptable risk of bone loss if prophylactic medication is administered. INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk. Alendronate should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis who have corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis In this paper we present two cases of young women who developed severe PAO with vertebral fractures: a 42-year-old woman with a family history of osteoporosis, and a 21-year-old woman affected with myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk"
Isn't it safe to use Abatacept during pregnancy?,yes,"These patients were exposed to rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) or abatacept (fusion protein CTLA4Ig) during the first trimester of their pregnancies. No significant adverse effects or complications were observed during the pregnancies, and all three patients delivered healthy newborns.  Despite these favorable outcomes, the use of these two biological agents must follow international recommendations. Their use is not currently allowed during pregnancy except in cases where the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus PREGNANCY:                          Azathioprine, chloroquine, cyclosporin A, prednisolone, sulfasalazine, tacrolimus and cyclophosphamide (only after the second trimester) may be administered during pregnancy. Biologics should be avoided unless there is a treatment need in cases of uncontrolled disease activity. As such, it is recommended that abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab be withheld prior to pregnancy; however, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and anakinra may be continued until conception.  Case reports on abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy are not conclusive. The very limited experience with abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy allows no statement as to their compatibility with pregnancy. At present use of biological agents throughout pregnancy cannot be recommended. Drugs recommended to be stopped before pregnancy include methotrexate and leflunomide, plus the biologics: anti-TNF agents, rituximab and abatacept. Whereas methotrexate, leflunomide, abatacept and rituximab must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates can be continued until conception. Pregnancy experience with abatacept and rituximab is still too limited to prove their safety for the developing fetus. They must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy. Prophylactic withdrawal of drugs before pregnancy is mandatory for abatacept, rituximab, LEF and MMF."

Are messenger RNA molecules epigenetically methylated?,yes,"The most abundant mRNA post-transcriptional modification is N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), which has broad roles in RNA biology. N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modified base in eukaryotic mRNA and has been linked to diverse effects on mRNA fate.  Recently, methylation patterns have also been revealed in mRNA. Surprisingly, the two most commonly studied methylation states in mRNA (m6A and m5C) are found to be enriched in 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions), the target site for the majority of miRNAs. MeT-DB: a database of transcriptome methylation in mammalian cells Methyltranscriptome is an exciting new area that studies the mechanisms and functions of methylation in transcripts. The MethylTranscriptome DataBase (MeT-DB, http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/methylation/) is the first comprehensive resource for N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in mammalian transcriptome. Mammalian messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) contain tens of thousands of posttranscriptional chemical modifications. Among these, the N(6)-methyl-adenosine (m(6)A) modification is the most abundant and can be removed by specific mammalian enzymes. Recent discoveries of reversible N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation on messenger RNA (mRNA) and mapping of m(6)A methylomes in mammals and yeast have revealed potential regulatory functions of this RNA modification. There are several identified methylation modifications in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), such as N(7)-methylguanosine (m(7)G) at the cap, N(6)-methyl-2'-O-methyladenosine (m(6)Am), 2'-O-methylation (Nm) within the cap and the internal positions, and internal N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C)."
Is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging indicated in the pre-participation screening of athletes?,no,"As modern imaging further enhances our understanding of the spectrum of athlete's heart, its role may expand from the assessment of athletes with suspected disease to being part of comprehensive pre-participation screening in apparently healthy athletes. Finally we will address the role of CMR in pre-participation screening."
Isn't the HRC Ser96Ala variant associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy?,no,"The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM. The Ser96Ala (S96A) mutation within the histidine rich Ca(2+) binding protein (HRC) has recently been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially attributable to an increase in spontaneous Ca(2+) release events. A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy. The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers.  HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.

These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers."
Aren't there clinical trials using stem cells for the treatment of cardiac disease?,no,"Therapy with mesenchymal stem cells is one of the promising tools to improve outcomes after myocardial infarction. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are an ideal source of mesenchymal stem cells due to their abundance and ease of preparation. Furthermore, several ongoing clinical trials using ASCs are producing promising results for heart diseases. Among the cell types under investigation, adult mesenchymal stem cells are widely studied, and in early stage, clinical studies show promise for repair and regeneration of cardiac tissues.  Accumulating data from preclinical and early phase clinical trials document their safety when delivered as either autologous or allogeneic forms in a range of cardiovascular diseases, but also importantly define parameters of clinical efficacy that justify further investigation in larger clinical trials.  several ongoing clinical trials using ASCs are producing promising results for heart diseases.  Clinical application of adult stem cells for therapy for cardiac disease. Stem cell-based therapies have the potential to fundamentally transform the treatment of ischemic cardiac injury and heart failure by achieving what would have been unthinkable only a few years ago-the Holy Grail of myocardial regeneration. Recent therapeutic approaches involve bone marrow (BM)-derived mononuclear cells and their subsets such as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells as well as adipose tissue-derived MSCs, cardiac tissue-derived stem cells, and cell combinations. Clinical trials employing these cells have demonstrated that cellular therapy is feasible and safe.

Among the cell types under investigation, adult mesenchymal stem cells are widely studied, and in early stage, clinical studies show promise for repair and regeneration of cardiac tissues.  Over the past 2 decades, there have been numerous stem cell studies focused on cardiac diseases, ranging from proof-of-concept to phase 2 trials.  Small uncontrolled clinical trials have demonstrated cardiac stem cells as a treatment option for cardiomyopathy. Stem cell populations are rapidly increasing, and we are still in the search of optimal cell types to use in clinical trials as bone marrow stem cells did not show significant improvement in cardiac function following transplantation. Several clinical trials using adult stem cell have shown improvements in cardiac function, however, the mechanism of their action is unclear and widespread tissue regeneration is not evident. As we await results from larger and more prolonged clinical trials, the science of stem cell therapy in cardiac disease keeps progressing. Stem cell therapy for treatment of cardiac disease has shown therapeutic potential. It should be noted that stem cell therapy is not limited to the treatment of ischemic cardiac disease. Over the past 2 decades, there have been numerous stem cell studies focused on cardiac diseases, ranging from proof-of-concept to phase 2 trials. This series of papers focuses on the legacy of these studies and the outlook for future treatment of cardiac diseases with stem cell therapies. Cell transplantation to repair or regenerate injured myocardium is a new frontier in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.  Current therapies only delay progression of the cardiac disease or replace the diseased heart with cardiac transplantation. Stem cells represent a recently discovered novel approach to the treatment of cardiac failure that may facilitate the replacement of diseased cardiac tissue and subsequently lead to improved cardiac function and cardiac regeneration.

Recent clinical trials have achieved favorable initial endpoints with improvements in cardiac function and clinical symptoms following cellular therapy. we consider how cardiac stem cell biology has led us into clinical trials, and we suggest that achieving true cardiac regeneration in patients may ultimately require resolution of critical controversies in experimental cardiac regeneration. Cell-based therapies and tissue engineering provide new promising platforms to develop upcoming therapeutic options. Initial clinical trials were able to generate promising results. A variety of different stem cell types have been used for the clinical application.   Insights gained from clinical trials of adult stem cells, together with fundamental scientific advances in cardiac stem cell and regenerative biology, are beginning to yield potential new targets and strategies for regenerative therapies.  Early animal trials have demonstrated the ability to improve cardiac function by transfer of HSCs into the myocardium, and early human studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of this approach."
Isn't the gene DUX4 epigenetically regulated in somatic cells?,no,"There are several genes on chromosome 4q35 region including DUX4 within D4Z4 repeats. Transcription of these genes is usually repressed by epigenetic modifications of this chromosomal region and also accumulation of transcriptional repressors to the repeat array. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues.  The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor encoded in each repeat.  These mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells. In contrast to control skeletal muscle and most other somatic tissues, full-length DUX4 transcript and protein is expressed at relatively abundant levels in human testis, most likely in the germ-line cells. Induced pluripotent (iPS) cells also express full-length DUX4 and differentiation of control iPS cells to embryoid bodies suppresses expression of full-length DUX4, whereas expression of full-length DUX4 persists in differentiated FSHD iPS cells. Together, these findings indicate that full-length DUX4 is normally expressed at specific developmental stages and is suppressed in most somatic tissues. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells.

Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. Normally expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues, DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle induces expression of many germline, stem cell, and other genes that might account for the pathophysiology of FSHD. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues Normally expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues, DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle induces expression of many germline, stem cell, and other genes that might account for the pathophysiology of FSHD DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues The identification of the gene(s) and the exact epigenetic pathway underlining this disease will be mandatory to increase the rate of diagnosis for FSHD2 patients and to confirm the hypothesis of a common FSHD1 and FSHD2 pathophysiological pathway involving DUX4 gene This deletion induces epigenetic modifications that affect the expression of several genes located in the vicinity. In each D4Z4 element, we identified the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene. DUX4 expresses a transcription factor that plays a major role in the development of FSHD through the initiation of a large gene dysregulation cascade that causes myogenic differentiation defects, atrophy and reduced response to oxidative stress.  decreased epigenetic repression and variegated expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is characterized by chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on chromosome 4 and expression of the D4Z4-encoded DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. derepression of the DUX4 retrogene The aim of our study was to identify relationships between epigenetic parameters correlating with a relaxed chromatin state of the DUX4 promoter region and clinical severity as measured by a clinical severity score or muscle pathologic changes in D4Z4 contraction-dependent (FSHD1) and -independent (FSHD2) facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy patients.  Specifically, abundance of RNA transcripts encoded by the DUX4 locus correlated to differential DNA methylation and H3K36me3 enrichment. Together, these findings indicate that full-length DUX4 is normally expressed at specific developmental stages and is suppressed in most somatic tissue"
Is it possible to determine the proteome of a formalin fixed and paraffin embedded  (FFPE) tissue?,yes,"ver the last few years, advances in methodology have made it possible to recover peptides from FFPE tissues that yield a reasonable representation of the proteins recovered from identical fresh or frozen specimens. Thus, laser capture microdissection of FFPE tissue coupled with downstream proteomic analysis is a valid approach Qualitative proteome profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is advancing the field of clinical proteomics. Recent improvements in proteomics technologies, from the 2D gel analysis of intact proteins to the ""shotgun"" quantification of peptides and the use of isobaric tags for absolute and relative quantification (iTRAQ) method, have made the analysis of FFPE tissues possible. The ability to investigate the proteome of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues can be considered a major recent achievement in the field of clinical proteomics. The label-free approach enables the quantitative measurement of radiation-induced alterations in FFPE tissue and facilitates retrospective biomarker identification using clinical archives. Proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissue using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We report that differentially expressed proteins can be identified among FFPE tissue specimens originating from individuals with different pancreatic histologic findings. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) proteome analysis using gel-free and gel-based proteomics. This study will facilitate the development of future proteomic analysis of FFPE tissue and provide a tool for the validation in archival samples of biomarkers of exposure, prognosis and disease. The CAAR method presented here complements previously described antigen-retrieval protocols and is an important step in being able to fully analyze the proteome of archived FFPE tissue. Proteome, phosphoproteome, and N-glycoproteome are quantitatively preserved in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and analyzable by high-resolution mass spectrometry. It has only recently been shown that proteins in FFPE tissues can be identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics but analysis of post-translational modifications is thought to be difficult or impossible Results from the FFPE-FASP procedure do not indicate any discernible changes due to storage time, hematoxylin staining or laser capture microdissection. Thus, FFPE biobank material can be analyzed by quantitative proteomics at the level of proteins and post-translational modifications. A novel tissue microdissection technique has been developed and combined with a method to extract soluble peptides directly from FFPE tissue for mass spectral analysis of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Hundreds of proteins from PCa and BPH tissue were identified, espite using tissue blocks stored for as many as 28 years, high confidence and comparative proteome analysis between the leiomyomas and the sarcoma is achieved. These findings demonstrate that formalin fixation, paraffin processing, and LCM do not negatively impact protein quality and quantity as determined by MS and that FFPE samples are amenable to global proteomic analysis. Protein extraction of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue enables robust proteomic profiles by mass spectrometry."
Isn't sumoylation implicated in myogenesis?,no,"Sentrin/small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 2 (SENP2) has broad de-SUMOylation activities in vitro, which is essential for embryonic heart development. Silencing SENP2 can reduce myostatin expression and, therefore, promote myogenesis of skeletal muscle. These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. Overexpression of c-Ski/SnoN also induces skeletal muscle differentiation, but how c-Ski/SnoN function in myogenesis is largely unknown. Notably, loss of sumoylation in the Lys-50 site (via a Lys-to-Arg point mutation) potently activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhances myotube formation. Our study suggests a novel role for SUMO modification in the regulation of myogenic differentiation. Although this modification has little effect on SnoN repression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and only modestly potentiates SnoN repression of the p21 promoter, SnoN sumoylation robustly augments the ability of SnoN to suppress transcription of the myogenesis master regulatory gene myogenin Our study also points to a physiological role for SnoN sumoylation in the control of myogenin expression in differentiating muscle cells. Here, we biochemically characterize SnoN sumoylation in detail and report the physiological function of the modification.  An essential role of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific Protease 2 in myostatin expression and myogenesis. These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. The E3 SUMO ligase Nse2 regulates sumoylation and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of skNAC-Smyd1 in myogenesis. Sumoylation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor sharp-1 regulates recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a and function in myogenesis.  We show that the overall load of sumoylated proteins present in myoblasts diminishes progressively throughout myogenesis These novel results suggest that protein sumoylation plays a pivotal role in myoblast differentiation and is required to regulate the activity of key targets downstream of MyoD and myogenin. a composite sequence motif has recently been identified that couples phosphorylation, sumoylation, and perhaps also deacetylation to control transcriptional repression in stress response, mitogen and nuclear hormone signaling, myogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. Mutation of these SUMO acceptor sites in Sharp-1 does not impact its subcellular localization but attenuates its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit myogenic differentiation. Consistently, co-expression of the SUMO protease SENP1 with wild type Sharp-1 abrogates Sharp-1-dependent inhibition of myogenesis.  Transforming growth factor-beta-independent regulation of myogenesis by SnoN sumoylation. Ubiquitin Specific Protease 25 (USP25), a member of the deubiquitinase family, is involved in several disease-related signal pathways including myogenesis, immunity and protein degradation.   In addition, we show that the skNAC interaction partner Smyd1 contains a putative sumoylation motif and is sumoylated in muscle cells, with depletion of Mms21/Nse2 leading to reduced concentrations of sumoylated Smyd1. Taken together, our data suggest that the function, specifically the balance between the nuclear and cytosolic roles, of the skNAC-Smyd1 complex might be regulated by sumoylation."
Isn't shotgun lipidomics the direct infusion of a lipid sample into a mass spectrometer?,no,"In direct infusion/injection (or shotgun) lipidomics An efficient shotgun lipidomics strategy was established and optimized for fast phospholipid profiling of viscera from three fish species: Lateolabrax japonicas, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, and Carassius auratus. This strategy relies on direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a tandem mass spectrometer without additional separation of the individual molecular species.  Top-down shotgun lipidomics relies on direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer shotgun lipidomic approaches that use direct infusion direct infusion (shotgun lipidomics)  direct infusion-based shotgun lipidomics approaches shotgun lipidomics (MDMS-SL) data, which are acquired directly from lipid extracts after direct infusion  Through direct infusion of the resultant enriched solution, we identified and quantitated a variety of very-low-abundance sphingolipid classes (e.g., sphingosine, psychosine, and lysosphingomyelin) and molecular species (e.g., sphingomyelin) using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (i.e., shotgun sphingolipidomics)."
Is there evidence for somatic mosaicism in Tuberous Sclerosis?,yes,"There are several case reports of solitary SEGA without any other manifestations of TSC. Usually these cases are thought to be forme fruste of TSC due to somatic mosaicism. Female germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis confirmed by molecular genetic analysis This is the first case of germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis proven by molecular genetic analysis and also the first example of female germline mosaicism for a characterized autosomal dominant gene mutation apparently not associated with somatic mosaicism. Mutation screening by RT-PCR and direct sequencing of the TSC2 gene identified a 4 bp insertion TACT following nucleotide 2077 in exon 18 which was present in the three affected children but not in five unaffected siblings or the parents. This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother."
Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioblastoma patients?,yes,"Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas. Patients with tumors lacking hTERT expression/TA showed a significant survival benefit (Kaplan-Meier test, both P < .01), which, however, was based exclusively on the younger patient subgroup (≤60 y, both P < .005; >60 y, both ns).  Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs"
Are there any desmins present in plants?,no,"Inherited mutations in the gene coding for the intermediate filament protein desmin have been demonstrated to cause severe skeletal and cardiac myopathies. Mutations in the intermediate filament (IF) protein desmin cause severe forms of myofibrillar myopathy characterized by partial aggregation of the extrasarcomeric desmin cytoskeleton and structural disorganization of myofibrils. The family of 70 intermediate filament genes (including those encoding keratins, desmins, and lamins) is now known to be associated with a wide range of diverse diseases, at least 72 distinct human pathologies, including skin blistering, muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, premature aging syndromes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cataract.

We have characterized a clone of desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library.  Immunohistochemical investigation showed a positive reaction for smooth muscle actin and desmins in the spindle cells proliferated in the lymph nodes; no cytokeratin positivity was detected.  We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide, electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine heart Purkinje fibers.  Mesothelial and ovarian carcinoma cells could not be distinguished by (intermediate) filament typing, using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to keratins, vimentins and desmins. A fast and convenient procedure for the purification of polymerization-competent smooth-muscle desmin is described. Desmin from chicken gizzard and hog stomach were compared by fingerprint techniques."
Isn't skin color affected by variations of the SLC24A5 gene?,no,"the alleles of single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1426654 and rs1834640 (SLC24A5) associated with light skin pigmentation in Eurasian populati Associations between five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to play a role in pigmentation (rs1426654-SLC24A5, rs1042602-TYR, rs16891982-SLC45A2, rs6058017-ASIP, and rs642742-KITLG) and MI measures were tested using standard one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) within each population."
Aren't there interactomes available for POU5F1 and SOX2?,no,"The interactomes of POU5F1 and SOX2 enhancers in human embryonic stem cells. We assayed long-range chromosomal interactions on putative enhancers of POU5F1 and SOX2 genes in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using 4C-Seq technique. We discovered that their frequent interacting regions mainly overlap with early DNA replication domains. The interactomes are associated with active histone marks and enriched with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine sites. In hESCs, genes within the interactomes have elevated expression. Additionally, some genes associated with the POU5F1 enhancer contribute to pluripotency. Binding sites for multiple DNA binding proteins, including ATF3, CTCF, GABPA, JUND, NANOG, RAD21 and YY1, are enriched in both interactomes."
Are osteoclasts specialized in bone degradation?,yes,"osteoclast-mediated attack on bone Bone degradation is caused by osteoclasts, the normal bone-resorbing cells.  Cathepsin K is a highly potent collagenase in osteoclasts and is responsible for bone degradation. In osteoclasts, Src controls podosome organization and bone degradation, which leads to an osteopetrotic phenotype in src(-/-) mice Bone degradation by osteoclasts depends on the formation of a sealing zone, composed of an interlinked network of podosomes, which delimits the degradation lacuna into which osteoclasts secrete acid and proteolytic enzymes."
Isn't golimumab effective for ulcerative colitis?,no,"Initial experience with golimumab in clinical practice for ulcerative colitis. BACKGROUND: Golimumab is a TNF-blocking agent indicated as a second-line therapy in ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this short study, golimumab seems to be an alternative treatment in naive and non-naive anti-TNF ulcerative colitis patients. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of 1-Year Treatment with Golimumab/Standard Care and Standard Care Alone for Ulcerative Colitis in Poland. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1 year of ulcerative colitis with golimumab/standard care and standard care alone in Poland. CONCLUSIONS: The biologic treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with golimumab/standard care is more effective but also more costly compared with standard care alone. Currently, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are available in the East Asian medical market, and these agents have been shown to be effective for inducing and maintaining long-term remission of IBD. Furthermore, upcoming treatments are introduced, such as golimumab, vedolizumab, AJM300, tofacitinib. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in efficacy in the maintenance phase between infliximab and golimumab or adalimumab were revealed. Infliximab proved to be more effective than adalimumab but of similar efficacy to that of golimumab in the induction phase. In this review, we will provide a detailed discussion of the three tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors currently approved for treatment of ulcerative colitis: infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab.

Aren't transcribed ultraconserved regions involved in cancer?,no,"Although most cancer research has focused in mRNA, non-coding RNAs are also an essential player in tumorigenesis. In addition to the well-recognized microRNAs, recent studies have also shown that epigenetic silencing by CpG island hypermethylation of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) or small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), also occur in human neoplasia Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named 'hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients Consistent with the hypothesis that T-UCRs have important function in tumor formation The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition Expression levels of transcribed ultraconserved regions uc.73 and uc.388 are altered in colorectal cancer Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed. It has recently been proven in cancer systems that differentially expressed T-UCRs could alter the functional characteristics of malignant cells. Genome-wide profiling revealed that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemia and carcinoma  Our preliminary results suggest that uc.73 and uc.388 could be potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in CRC patients The transcribed-ultraconserved regions: a novel class of long noncoding RNAs involved in cancer susceptibility This review gives a picture of the state of the art of a novel class of long ncRNA known as transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Most recent studies show that they are significantly altered in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemias, carcinomas, and pediatric neuroblastomas, leading to the hypothesis that UCRs may play a role in tumorigenesis and promising innovative future T-UCR-based therapeutic approaches CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of non-coding RNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions in human cancer We focused on the transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), a subset of DNA sequences that are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes and that are located in both intra- and intergenic regions. We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal the possible existence of an aberrant epigenetic silencing pattern of T-UCRs by treating cancer cells with a DNA-demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray containing these sequences. We observed that DNA hypomethylation induces release of T-UCR silencing in cancer cells. Among the T-UCRs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, Uc.160+, Uc283+A and Uc.346+ were found to undergo specific CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues. The analysis of a large set of primary human tumors (n=283) demonstrated that hypermethylation of the described T-UCR CpG islands was a common event among the various tumor types. Our finding that, in addition to microRNAs, another class of ncRNAs (T-UCRs) undergoes DNA methylation-associated inactivation in transformed cells supports a model in which epigenetic and genetic alterations in coding and non-coding sequences cooperate in human tumorigenesis An integrative genomics screen uncovers ncRNA T-UCR functions in neuroblastoma tumours Different classes of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, have recently been implicated in the process of tumourigenesis. In this study, we examined the expression and putative functions of a novel class of non-coding RNAs known as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) in neuroblastoma our results define a T-UCR expression landscape in neuroblastoma and suggest widespread T-UCR involvement in diverse cellular processes that are deregulated in the process of tumourigenesis Moreover, the recent demonstration that other ncRNAs, the ultraconserved genes (UCGs) or transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), are involved in human cancerogenesis, suggests that the wider family of ncRNAs (including both miRNAs and UCGs) could contribute to the development of the malignant phenotype. Here we review the main studies investigating the role of miRNAs and UCRs in both normal hemopoiesis and hematological malignancies, and identify the molecular, clinical and therapeutic implications of these recent findings The transcribed-ultraconserved regions: a novel class of long noncoding RNAs involved in cancer susceptibility. Expression levels of transcribed ultraconserved regions uc.73 and uc.388 are altered in colorectal cancer. CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of non-coding RNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions in human cancer. Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition.

Is it possible to purify pseudopodia to be used for proteomic analysis?,yes,"we developed an approach to biochemically isolate the pseudopodium from the cell body using 3.0-micrometer porous filters for large-scale quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis. Recent work using unique subcellular fractionation methodologies combined with spatial genomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic profiling has provided insight into the invadopodiome and pseudopodiome signaling networks  ere, we purified the pseudopodial proteomes tumor cells were placed on a fibronectin-coated porous membrane to form pseudopodia. According to the motile potentials of the cells, the cells formed pseudopodial microprocesses in the pores. An excimer laser, which was used for ophthalmic refractive surgeries, horizontally ablated cells at the membrane surface to remove the cell body.  we describe methods for the immunoaffinity purification of phosphotyrosine proteins (pY) from pseudopodia that have been isolated from migratory cells. These methods are compatible with current mass spectrometry-based protein identification technologies and can be utilized for the large-scale identification of the pseudopodium pY proteome in various migratory cell lines, including primary and cancer cells."
Isn't Turcot syndrome associated with glioblastoma?,no,"Turcot syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary tumors of the central nervous system and adenomatous colonic polyps during the first or second decades of life, with a spectrum of clinical features such as ""café-au-lait"" spots, axillary freckling, and hyperpigmented spots.  We present the case of a 20-year-old male with a clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme and multiple adenomatous colonic polyps.  Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare hereditary disorder clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary tumors of the colon and the central nervous system (CNS). Here we present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a synchronous clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and colonic adenocarcinoma. Based on this case study, the synchronous presentation of glioblastoma multiforme and adenocarcinoma of the colon might suggest a shorter survival rate for patients with Turcot syndrome.  A 15-year-old boy was admitted with the diagnosis of colonic polyposis, and during a 2-year follow-up, he underwent operation for right parieto-occipital anaplastic astrocytoma, left-side colonic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and cerebella glioblastoma which were all confirmed by histology. Although cases of Turcot's syndrome (TS) (colonic polyposis and primary brain tumour occurring in the same patient) have been previously described, association with haematological malignancy is rare. We hereby report such a case with TS. Type A microsatellite instability in pediatric gliomas as an indicator of Turcot syndrome.  Biallelic mutations of MMR genes are associated with pediatric cancers, including glial tumors, in Turcot syndrome type 1 (TS1). Glioblastomas with giant cell and sarcomatous features in patients with Turcot syndrome type 1: a clinicopathological study of 3 cases. Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare genetic disorder of DNA mismatch repair predisposing to glioblastoma (GBM) in the type 1 variant.  We report the clinicopathological and genetic features of 3 gliomas in TS type 1 patients. We conclude that 1) the giant cell variant of GBM is overrepresented in TS; 2) gliosarcomas may also be encountered; and 3) survival is often favorable, despite histological anaplasia and exuberant proliferation. Malignant transformation of high-grade astrocytoma associated with neurocysticercosis in a patient with Turcot syndrome. A 45-year-old woman with anaplastic astrocytoma was clinically diagnosed with Turcot syndrome, and subsequently developed simultaneous neurocysticercosis and malignant transformation to glioblastoma.  Familial glioblastoma multiforme is a rather uncommon entity, being in most cases associated to known genetic disorders (as Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, etc.).  Turcot syndrome (MIM276300) has been described as the association of central nervous system malignant tumors and familial colorectal cancer and has been reported to be both a dominant and recessive disorder. We report here the first identification of a homozygous mutation in MSH6 in a family with childhood-onset brain tumor, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, and neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotype.  Of the 21 patients, 12 have died (10 after relapse, with a median time to progression for the whole series of 14 months; one with intratumoral bleeding at 40 months after diagnosis; and one affected by Turcot syndrome for duodenal cancer relapse). [Glioblastoma multiforme as a manifestation of Turcot syndrome]. In the present case, a 60-year-old patient with glioblastoma multiforme and a history of hereditary malignomas is described as an example of a HNPCC-associated Turcot's syndrome. Computed tomography brain scan and computed tomography-guided biopsy revealed a left frontoparietal glioblastoma multiforme. This case illustrates the rare presentation of Turcot syndrome-a hereditary colorectal polyposis syndrome-in an older adult. Turcot syndrome is the association of colorectal polyposis with primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma.  Brain tumor is mainly diagnosed as glioblastoma or astrocytoma and mismatch repair genes might be involved.  Patients with Turcot syndrome (TS) are predisposed to colon tumors and primary brain tumors, typically glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. The authors describe a patient with TS featuring a known germline mutation of exon 5 of the hPMS2 mismatch repair gene who developed two metachronous glioblastomas, both with distinct oligodendroglial features. Because this patient had an unusual underlying condition and his tumor had a unique histological appearance for TS, it was hypothesized that this genetic defect may predispose to malignant gliomas with oligodendroglial features.  Turcot Syndrome caused by APC gene develops medulloblastoma and Turcot Syndrome caused by mismatch repair gene develops glioblastoma.  It is characterized by central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms and gastrointestinal polyposis. Seven months after resection of this Dukes' C2 adenocarcinoma, she presented with a second primary CNS tumor, a glioblastoma multiforme. The Turcot syndrome has been defined as the simultaneous presence of multiple polyposis of the colon and a malignant brain tumor. The case of a 47-year-old man submitted to a right hemicolectomy for cancer and polyposis, following a series of endoscopic polypectomies and, finally, removal of left temporal glioma is here presented.  Two of 13 showed microsatellite instability, one of which in a patient with Turcot syndrome, the other in gliomatosis cerebri. The Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare, probably autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by development of primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps.  However, no somatic mutations in APC were found among 91 neuroepithelial tumors (medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma), whether sporadic or associated with TS.  Such syndromes include neurofibromatosis type 2, neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, as well as von Hippel-Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Turcot syndrome.  This patient's case deals with the association between a glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma (WHO Grade III) and colonic adenocarcinoma based on familial polyposis coli.  The authors describe two patients with the association of polyposis-coli and central nervous system tumor (Turcot's syndrome).  We report a case of Turcot's syndrome in a 20-year old man with multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and glioblastoma multiforme.  Another unusual autopsy case of the Turcot syndrome is reported in a 23-year-old woman with polyposis coli, who developed primary carcinoma of the jejunum and glioblastoma multiforme of the left frontal lobe.  Turcot syndrome represents the unique and discrete occurrence of polyposis coli with glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, or both."

Isn't there a role for the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) in lung cancer?,no,"Over-expressing CYLD augments antitumor activity of TRAIL by inhibiting the NF-κB survival signaling in lung cancer cells increased expression of CYLD directly blocks TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation, and consequently increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. CYLD may act as a therapeutic target of lung cancer. Targeting CYLD, in combination with TRAIL, may be a new strategy to treat lung cancer with high NF-κB activity Truncation of the catalytic domain of the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor impairs lung maturation down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer Deletion of exon 9 would cause a carboxyl-terminal truncation of CYLD and inactivation of its deubiquitinating activity. In accordance with previous studies, fibroblasts from Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) embryos had hyperactive nuclear factor kappaB and c-Jun kinase pathways compared with control fibroblasts. Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) newborn mice were smaller than wild-type littermates with a short and kinky tail and no major developmental defects. However, Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) mice died shortly after birth from apparent respiratory dysfunction. Histological examination of E18.5 Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) lungs demonstrated an immature phenotype characterized by hyperplasic mesenchyme but apparently normal epithelial, smooth muscle. and endothelial structures. Our study identifies an important role of CYLD in lung maturation, which may underlie the development of many cases of lung cancer Mutations that truncate and inactivate the carboxyl-terminal deubiquitinating domain of CYLD underlie the development of skin appendage tumors in humans, whereas down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer.

Is progesterone effective for treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury based on clinical trial data?,no,"BACKGROUND: Progesterone has been associated with robust positive effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and with clinical benefits in two phase 2 randomized, controlled trials.  The proportion of patients with a favorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (good recovery or moderate disability) was 50.4% with progesterone, as compared with 50.5% with placebo. Mortality was similar in the two groups. No relevant safety differences were noted between progesterone and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary efficacy analyses showed no clinical benefit of progesterone in patients with severe TBI. These data stand in contrast to the robust preclinical data and results of early single-center trials that provided the impetus to initiate phase 3 trials. BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Progesterone has been shown to improve neurologic outcome in multiple experimental models and two early-phase trials involving patients with TBI.  There was no significant difference between the progesterone group and the placebo group in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (relative benefit of progesterone, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.06; P=0.35). Phlebitis or thrombophlebitis was more frequent in the progesterone group than in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.03; CI, 1.96 to 4.66).  CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not show a benefit of progesterone over placebo in the improvement of outcomes in patients with acute TBI.  Numerous studies, however, show that progesterone has substantial pleiotropic properties as a neuroprotective agent in both animal models and humans. RESULTS: There was a better recovery rate and GOS score for the patients who were given progesterone than for those in the control group in a 3-months follow-up period (50% vs. 21%); subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the percentage of favorable outcome between the two groups with GCS of 5-8 (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of progesterone may significantly improve neurologic outcome of patients suffering severe TBI up to 3 months after injury, especially those with 5≤GCS≤8, providing a potential benefit to the treatment of acute severe TBI patients. Considering this drug had no significant side effects, so progesterone could be used in patients with severe TBI as a neuro-protective drug. While progesterone and ciclosporin have shown promise in phase II studies, success in larger phase III, randomized, multicentre, clinical trials is pending.  All three studies reported the effects of progesterone on mortality. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up was 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone to be 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. GOS was classified to 2 main categories of favorable and unfavorable recovery, of which, favorable recovery in placebo, progesterone, and progesterone-vitamin D was 25%, 45%, and 60%, respectively which showed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P-value = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The results showed that recovery rate in patients with severe brain trauma in the group receiving progesterone and vitamin D together was significantly higher than that of progesterone group, which was in turn higher than that of placebo group.  The pooled relative risk (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up is 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone was 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.96. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury.  Improved outcomes from the administration of progesterone for patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  The modified Functional Independence Measure scores in the progesterone group were higher than those in the placebo group at both 3-month and 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). The mortality rate of the progesterone group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  These data, combined with the results of the previously published ProTECT trial, show progesterone to be safe and potentially efficacious in the treatment of TBI. Larger phase III trials will be necessary to verify results prior to clinical implementation. CONCLUSION: It indicated that successive early application of PG will benefit the patients with acute severe head injury by improving the recovery and reducing the disability, which may be related to its alleviating inflammatory and lipid peroxidation response. Adverse and serious adverse event rates were similar in both groups, except that patients randomized to progesterone had a lower 30-day mortality rate than controls (rate ratio 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.99).  However, moderate traumatic brain injury survivors who received progesterone were more likely to have a moderate to good outcome than those randomized to placebo. CONCLUSION: In this small study, progesterone caused no discernible harm and showed possible signs of benefit. After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries. After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries A US National Institutes of Health-sponsored, nationwide Phase III clinical trial is now evaluating progesterone for moderate-to-severe TBI in 1200 patients An industry-sponsored Phase III international trial is also under way, and planning for a trial using progesterone to treat pediatric brain injury has begun More than two decades of pre-clinical research and two recent clinical trials have shown that progesterone (PROG) and its metabolites exert beneficial effects after traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a number of metabolic and physiological pathways that can reduce damage in many different tissues and organ systems After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries RESULTS: Analysis of these reviews yielded meanfuling observations: (1) The effectiveness of most ordinary treatments in TBI is inconclusive except that corticosteroids are likely to be ineffective or harmful, and tranexamic acid, nimodipine and progesterone show a promising effect in bleeding trauma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, TBI or severe TBI. Laboratory data strongly show that progesterone treatment after TBI reduces edema, improves outcomes, and restores blood-brain barrier function. Clinical studies to date agree with these data, and there are ongoing human trials for progesterone treatment after TBI."
Isn't there any tool that facilitates the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish?,no,"Zebrafish enhancer detection (ZED) vector: a new tool to facilitate transgenesis and the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish. he cis-regulatory sequences control when, where, and how much genes are transcribed and can activate (enhancers) or repress (silencers) gene expression. Here, we describe a novel Tol2 transposon-based vector for assessing enhancer activity in the zebrafish (Danio rerio). This Zebrafish Enhancer Detector (ZED) vector harbors several key improvements, among them a sensitive and specific minimal promoter chosen for optimal enhancer activity detection, insulator sequences to shield the minimal promoter from position effects, and a positive control for transgenesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that highly conserved noncoding sequences homologous between humans and zebrafish largely with enhancer activity largely retain their tissue-specific enhancer activity during vertebrate evolution. More strikingly, insulator sequences from mouse and chicken, but not conserved in zebrafish, maintain their insulator capacity when tested in this model.

Can Alzheimer's disease related miRNAs be detected in patients' blood?,yes,"miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in AD, and these have been implicated in the regulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, tau, inflammation, cell death, and other aspects which are the main pathomechanisms of AD. In addition, regulation of miRNAs varies in blood, and cerebral spinal fluid may indicate alterations in AD. miRNA microarray analysis was carried out on blood of rats at 1 week and 2 months after injection. RESULTS: Many up- and downregulated miRNAs were detected. Blood miRNAs could be useful as biomarkers for exposure to nanoparticles. miR-298 regulates β-amyloid (Aβ) precursor protein-converting enzyme-1 (BACE1) in Alzheimer's disease.  We previously studied microRNAs (miRNAs) in AD autopsy brain samples and reported a connection between miR-137, -181c, -9, -29a/b and AD, through the regulation of ceramides. In this study, the potential role of these miRNAs as diagnostic markers for AD was investigated. We identified that these miRNAs were down-regulated in the blood serum of probable AD patients.  287 with Alzheimer disease (AD) as compared with 344 age- and gender-matched controls. In addition, we evaluated expression levels of hnRNP-A1 and its regulatory microRNA (miR)-590-3p in blood cells from patients and controls. Decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-590-3p was observed in patients with AD versus controls (0.685 ± 0.080 versus 0.931 ± 0.111, p = 0.079), and correlated negatively with hnRNP-A1 mRNA levels (r = -0.615, p = 0.0237). expression analysis of Sp1 and its regulatory microRNAs (hsa-miR-29b and hsa-miR-375) has been performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), together with Sp1 protein analysis. Significantly decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-29b, but not of hsa-miR-375, were observed in AD patients Sp1 and its regulatory hsa-miR-29b are deregulated in AD patients, possibly leading to aberrant production of downstream target genes involved in the pathogenesis.  We previously observed that miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b post-transcriptionally regulate SPT levels, and the corresponding miRNA levels in the blood sera are potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Here, we observe a negative correlation between cortical Aβ42 and sera Aβ42, and a positive correlation between cortical miRNA levels and sera miRNA levels suggesting their potential as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers."
Can't RG7112 inhibit MDM2?,no,"To assess the influence of the p53 regulatory pathway further, we studied the effect of RG7112, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with MDM2, on normal megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. RG7112 (2g) is the first clinical small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor designed to occupy the p53-binding pocket of MDM2. Effect of the MDM2 antagonist RG7112 on the P53 pathway in patients with MDM2-amplified, well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma: an exploratory proof-of-mechanism study. We report a proof-of-mechanism study of RG7112, a small-molecule MDM2 antagonist, in patients with chemotherapy-naive primary or relapsed well-differentiated or dedifferentiated MDM2-amplified liposarcoma who were eligible for resection. To assess the influence of the p53 regulatory pathway further, we studied the effect of RG7112, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with MDM2, on normal megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. Discovery of RG7112: A Small-Molecule MDM2 Inhibitor in Clinical Development. RG7112 was the first small-molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitor in clinical development. RG7112 binds MDM2 with high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. RG7112 is a selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The effects of RG7112 and Peg-IFNα 2a on MPN progenitor cells were dependent on blocking p53-MDM2 interactions and activating the p53 pathway, thereby increasing MPN CD34(+) cell apoptosis The orally bioavailable MDM2 antagonist RG7112 and pegylated interferon α 2a target JAK2V617F-positive progenitor and stem cells Initial testing of the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program In this issue of Blood, Lu et al describe the cooperation between an orally bioavailable mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) antagonist (RG7112) and the pegylated interferon α (Peg-IFNα 2a) to target JAK2V617F hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells MDM2 small-molecule antagonist RG7112 activates p53 signaling and regresses human tumors in preclinical cancer models. Activation of p53 by the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 impairs thrombopoiesis. The orally bioavailable MDM2 antagonist RG7112 and pegylated interferon α 2a target JAK2V617F-positive progenitor and stem cells. Initial testing of the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. The primary endpoint was to assess markers of RG7112-dependent MDM2 inhibition and P53 pathway activation (P53, P21, MDM2, Ki-67, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 [MIC-1], and apoptosis).  RG7112 is a selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RG7112 was selected for evaluation by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) due to the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations in pediatric cancers compared with adult malignancies. However, the hydrophobic protein-protein interaction surface represents a significant challenge for the development of small-molecule inhibitors with desirable pharmacological profiles. RG7112 was the first small-molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitor in clinical development. Treatment with low doses of RG7112, an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of p53-MDM2, both alone and combined with pegylated interferon α 2a (Peg-IFNα 2a), significantly decreased MPN colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage and burst-forming unit-erythroid numbers and preferentially eliminated the total number of JAKV617F(+) MPN hematopoietic progenitor cells. The effects of RG7112 and Peg-IFNα 2a on MPN progenitor cells were dependent on blocking p53-MDM2 interactions and activating the p53 pathway, thereby increasing MPN CD34(+) cell apoptosis. RG7112 (2g) is the first clinical small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor designed to occupy the p53-binding pocket of MDM2. In cancer cells expressing wild-type p53, RG7112 stabilizes p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition or regression of human tumor xenografts."
Isn't recommended the use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting?,yes,"Short duration postoperative iv T(3) therapy increases cardiac index and does not alter mortality. We conclude that although widespread interest has been shown on the use of thyroid hormones in the perioperative period, and the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid hormone metabolism widely studied, there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. There is no clear evidence at this point to support thyroid hormone replacement in the latter patients, and it may be potentially harmful. Rather, we hold that T3 treatment of various surgical and other patients with nonthyroidal illness should be deferred until proof of its therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated. Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Routine use after coronary surgery is thus not recommended. Although mild effects on myocardial performance may exist, we cannot recommend at this time the routine use of intravenous T(3) as an inotropic agent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy. Thus, there seems to be no sound justification for a routine use of T3 in patients undergoing open-heart procedures."
Isn't there increased incidence of incontinence in athletes?,no,"Urinary incontinence affects women of all ages, including top female athletes, but is often under-reported. The highest prevalence of urinary incontinence is reported in those participating in high impact sports. The prevalence of female stress urinary incontinence is high, and young adults are also affected, including athletes, especially those involved in ""high-impact"" sports Analysis of these data suggests that perineal pressure is decreased in female athletes compared with nonathlete women. A lower perineal pressure correlates with increased symptoms of urinary incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction. Urinary incontinence is a prevalent condition among athletes that is not openly discussed. High-level sport appears to be a significant independent risk factor for AI in healthy young women.  The prevalence of LUTS was 54.7%, and 30% for urinary incontinence. LUTS and incontinence are prevalent in female athletes. A relationship between sport or fitness activities and urinary incontinence (UI) previously has been described in women.  studies have also shown a high prevalence of SUI in young, physically fit female athletes.  There was urinary incontinence in female long-distance runners and a correlation with eating disorders. young female athletes participating in high-impact sports may be at higher risk for urinary incontinence. Results indicated that more than 25% of those completing surveys experienced incontinence and that more than 90% had never told anyone about their problem and had no knowledge of preventive measures; 16% reported incontinence negatively impacted their quality of life. There is a very high prevalence of urinary incontinence in women athletes. Women athletes should be counseled about the increased risk of urinary incontinence with ultra high-impact sports and eating disorders. Stress urinary incontinence is a barrier to women's participation in sport and fitness activities and, therefore, it may be a threat to women's health, self-esteem and well-being. The prevalence during sports among young, nulliparous elite athletes varies between 0% (golf) and 80% (trampolinists). The highest prevalence is found in sports involving high impact activities such as gymnastics, track and field, and some ball games Urinary leakage is common among elite athletes and dancers, particularly during training, but also during daily life activities. There is a high prevalence of stress and urge incontinence in female elite athletes. The frequency of SUI and urge incontinence was significantly higher in eating disordered athletes compared with healthy athletes. High impact sports activities may produce urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence during physical stresses is common in young nulliparous wome Incontinence during physical stresses is common in young, highly fit, nulliparous women."
Isn't PTEN involved in follicular thyroid carcinoma?,no,"Two of the 259 patients (0.8%), with both follicular thyroid carcinoma and macrocephaly, were found to carry a germline mutation in the PTEN gene. The PTEN mutation frequency in unselected cases of follicular thyroid carcinoma was 4.8% The frequency of germline pathogenic PTEN mutations in an unselected series of patients with DTC is relatively low, but it is enriched by considering follicular histology and macrocephaly Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) A single male with follicular thyroid carcinoma from one of these 64 (2%) CS-like families harboured a germline point mutation, c.209T-->C Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors. These results show a high frequency of PTEN promoter hypermethylation, especially in follicular tumors, suggesting its possible role in thyroid tumorigenesis Our findings suggest that the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is occasionally inactivated in sporadic follicular thyroid tumors Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase, have been found in up to 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome suggesting a role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors The most common neoplasms in Cowden disease patients arise in the breast, skin, and thyroid (follicular subtype) The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors"
Isn't the protein pelota a ribosomal rescue factor?,no,"a novel binding partner of the ribosome recycling protein Pelota n eukaryotes, Pelota (Dom34 in yeast) and Hbs1 are responsible for solving general problems of ribosomal stall in translation.  In eukaryotes, the protein complex of Pelota (yeast Dom34) and Hbs1 translational GTPase recognizes the stalled ribosome containing the defective mRNA."
Isn't a CpG island methylator phenotype involved in ependymomas?,no,"Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype Although no recurrently mutated genes were found throughout these groups of ependymomas, PFA exhibited a CpG island methylator phenotype, PFB was associated with extensive chromosomal aberrations, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion gene was frequently observed in supratentorial ependymomas.  Supratentorial and spinal pediatric ependymomas display a hypermethylated phenotype which includes the loss of tumor suppressor genes involved in the control of cell growth and death. Supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the 'CpG island methylator phenotype' (CIMP) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma. The data suggests epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of supratentorial and spinal, but not posterior fossa ependymomas. Hypermethylation correlated with a decrease in expression of a number of tumor suppressor genes and pathways that could be playing an important role in tumor pathogenesis. Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype. CpG island methylator phenotype-positive hindbrain ependymomas are responsive to clinical drugs that target either DNA or H3K27 methylation both in vitro and in vivo. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 47 hindbrain ependymomas reveals an extremely low mutation rate, and zero significant recurrent somatic single nucleotide variants. Although no recurrently mutated genes were found throughout these groups of ependymomas, PFA exhibited a CpG island methylator phenotype, PFB was associated with extensive chromosomal aberrations, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion gene was frequently observed in supratentorial ependymomas. ependymomas are common childhood brain tumours that occur throughout the nervous system but are most common in the paediatric hindbrain current standard therapy comprises surgery and radiation but not cytotoxic chemotherapy as it does not further increase survival whole genome and whole exome sequencing of 47 hindbrain ependymomas reveals an extremely low mutation rate and zero significant recurrent somatic single nucleotide variants although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations poor prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a cpg island methylator phenotype transcriptional silencing driven by cpg methylation converges exclusively on targets of the polycomb repressive complex 2 which represses expression of differentiation genes through trimethylation of h3k27 cpg island methylator phenotype positive hindbrain ependymomas are responsive to clinical drugs that target either dna or h3k27 methylation both in vitro and in vivo we conclude that epigenetic modifiers are the first rational therapeutic candidates for this deadly malignancy which is epigenetically deregulated but genetically bland. supratentorial and spinal pediatric ependymomas display a hypermethylated phenotype which includes the loss of tumor suppressor genes involved in the control of cell growth and death epigenomic alterations define lethal cimp positive ependymomas of infancy molecular genetics of ependymomas and pediatric diffuse gliomas a short review epigenetic alterations including methylation have been shown to be an important mechanism of gene silencing in cancer ependymoma has been well characterized at the dna copy number and mrna expression levels however little is known about dna methylation changes to gain a more global view of the methylation profile of ependymoma we conducted an array based analysis our data demonstrated tumors to segregate according to their location in the cns which was associated with a difference in the global level of methylation supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors similar to the cpg island methylator phenotype cimp identified in glioma and colon carcinoma this hypermethylated profile was associated with an increase in expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in methylating dna suggesting an underlying mechanism an integrated analysis of methylation and mrna expression array data allowed us to identify methylation induced expression changes most notably genes involved in the control of cell growth and death and the immune system were identified including members of the jnk pathway and pparg in conclusion we have generated a global view of the methylation profile of ependymoma the data suggests epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of supratentorial and spinal but not posterior fossa ependymomas hypermethylation correlated with a decrease in expression of a number of tumor suppressor genes and pathways that could be playing an important role in tumor pathogenesis. here we review the recent literature on molecular discoveries in ependymomas and pediatric diffuse gliomas ependymomas can now be categorized into three location related subgroups according to their biological profile posterior fossa ependymomas group a pfa and b pfb and supratentorial ependymomas although no recurrently mutated genes were found throughout these groups of ependymomas pfa exhibited a cpg island methylator phenotype pfb was associated with extensive chromosomal aberrations and the c11orf95 rela fusion gene was frequently observed in supratentorial ependymomas meanwhile it has now become apparent that pediatric diffuse gliomas have a distinct genetic status from their adult counterparts even though they share an indistinguishable histology in pediatric low grade diffuse gliomas an intragenic duplication of the portion of fgfr1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain tkd and rearrangements of myb mybl1 were found recurrently and mutually exclusively as for non brainstem high grade tumors in addition to h3f3a tp53 and atrx mutations which were frequently observed in older children recurrent fusions involving ntrk1 ntrk2 and ntrk3 were reported in infants younger than 3 years of age moreover in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas dipg recurrent somatic mutations of acvr1 were found in association with hist1h3b mutations."
Is rucaparib used for ovarian cancer treatment?,yes,"While olaparib is the first PARP inhibitor to receive approval for ovarian cancer treatment, others including rucaparib and niraparib are clearly effective in this disease and, within the next year or two, the results of ongoing randomised trials will clarify their respective roles.  Similar trials with other PARP inhibitors (rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib) are in progress and include non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.  IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), with a second agent (rucaparib) likely to be approved in the near future. Ovarian Cancers Harbour Defects in Non-Homologous End Joining Resulting in Resistance to Rucaparib. There are a number of other PARP inhibitors in late phase clinical development in ovarian cancer including rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and talazoparib.  Rucaparib in relapsed, platinum-sensitive high-grade ovarian carcinoma (ARIEL2 Part 1): an international, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial. INTERPRETATION: In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib.  Genomic LOH May Predict Rucaparib Response in Ovarian Cancer. High LOH is associated with response to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in BRCA wild-type ovarian cancer. Therapeutic potential of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor rucaparib for the treatment of sporadic human ovarian cancer.

Aren't TAD boundaries in Drosophila depleted in highly-expressed genes?,yes,"Furthermore, we find that these TAD boundaries are present irrespective of the expression and looping of genes located between them. In particular, Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into topologically associating domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes.  The insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions are each enriched for distinct epigenetic marks and are each correlated with different gene expression levels We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity combine to shape the local packing of the A. thaliana nuclear genome. Disruptions of topological chromatin domains cause pathogenic rewiring of gene-enhancer interactions. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome. The three-dimensional organization of a genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure. Ectopically expressed roX1 and roX2 RNAs target HAS on the X chromosome in trans and, via spatial proximity, induce spreading of the MSL complex in cis, leading to increased expression of neighboring autosomal genes.  Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin. However, Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes."
Can telomere length shortening be reversed by telomerase?,yes,"Telomere length is regulated around an equilibrium set point. Telomeres shorten during replication and are lengthened by telomerase. Disruption of the length equilibrium leads to disease; thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate length at the molecular level.  High telomerase activity is detected in nearly all human cancers but most human cells are devoid of telomerase activity. There is well-documented evidence that reactivation of telomerase occurs during cellular transformation. In humans, tumors can rely in reactivation of telomerase or originate in a telomerase positive stem/progenitor cell, or rely in alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent telomere-length maintenance mechanism.  Together, these observations may provoke a re-evaluation of telomere and telomerase based therapies, both in telomerase inhibition for cancer therapy and telomerase activation for tissue regeneration and anti-ageing strategies. Telomeres progressively shorten throughout life. A hallmark of advanced malignancies is the ability for continuous cell divisions that almost universally correlates with the stabilization of telomere length by the reactivation of telomerase. Telomerase-mediated telomere elongation provides cell populations with the ability to proliferate indefinitely. Telomerase is capable of recognizing and extending the shortest telomeres in cells; Telomerase gene therapy rescues telomere length, bone marrow aplasia, and survival in mice with aplastic anemia."
Isn't miR-126 involved in heart failure?,no,"he miRNAs miR-126 and miR-508-5p are associated with the outcome of ICM and NICM patients with CHF. These two miRNAs could be useful in the diagnosis of CHF patients, and might provide novel targets for prevention and treatment of CHF. The plasma concentration of miR-126 was negatively correlated with age and NYHA class, and could be a useful biomarker for heart failure. In 10 patients with heart failure, plasma concentrations of miR-126 were up-regulated with improvement of the NYHA class from IV to III."
Aren't there any functional differences between Mfd and its human Cocaine syndrome protein B (CSB) homolog?,no,"In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. CSB has an ATPase activity that is stimulated strongly by DNA; however, it neither acts as a helicase nor does it dissociate stalled RNA polymerase II, suggesting a coupling mechanism in humans different from that in prokaryotes.  In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. In contrast, no difference was detected in the rate of transcription recovery in mfd, uvrA, fpg, nth, or polB dinB umuDC mutants relative to wild-type cells following oxidative damage"
Doesn't MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) contribute to cardiovascular disease?,no,"The synergistic effect of miR-21 and miR-1 were functionally validated for their significant influences on myocardial apoptosis, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Taken together, we found a novel reciprocal loop between miR-21 and TGFβRIII in cardiac fibrosis caused by myocardial infarction in mice, and targeting this pathway could be a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of myocardial remodeling. It is still controversial whether microRNA-21 (miR-21) participates in the process of cardiac fibrosis. In mice, myocardial miR-21 overexpression is related to cardiac fibrosis elicited by pressure overload.  The myocardial and plasma levels of miR-21 were significantly higher in the AS patients compared with the controls and correlated directly with the echocardiographic mean transvalvular gradients. Our results support the role of miR-21 as a regulator of the fibrotic process that occurs in response to pressure overload in AS patients and underscore the value of circulating miR-21 as a biomarker for myocardial fibrosis. Ad-miR-21 improves LV remodeling and decreases the apoptosis of myocardial cells, suggesting the possible mechanism by which Ad-miR-21 functions in protecting against I/R injury. In the Ad-miR-21 group, LV dimensions, myocardial infarct size, LV/BW, collagen type Ⅰ, type Ⅲ and PCNA positive cells all significantly decreased compared with the Ad-GFP group. While miR-21, -133, -150, -195, and -214 regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, miR-1/-133 and miR-208 have been elucidated to influence myocardial contractile function. In addition, miR-21, -24, -133, -210, -494, and -499 appear to protect myocytes against I/R-induced apoptosis, whereas miR-1, -29, -199a, and -320 promote apoptosis. Myocardial fibrosis can be regulated by the miR-29 family and miR-21. The small regulatory RNA microRNA-21 (miR-21) plays a crucial role in a plethora of biological functions and diseases including development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and inflammation. During recent years, additional roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, including cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis as well as myocardial infarction have been described. On the other hand, miR-21, miR-199a, miR-210, and miR-494 have been proven critical for the myocytes' adaptation and survival during hypoxia/ischemia.  Studies have shown that several miRs, including miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-126, miR-320, miR-92a, and miR-199a, are regulated after preconditioning and play an active role in protecting the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Studies using various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models have suggested the possible involvement of miR-1, miR-21, miR-29, miR-92a, miR-133, miR-199a, and miR-320 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. Recent studies have revealed that its expression is deregulated in heart and vasculature under cardiovascular disease conditions such as proliferative vascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. miR-21 is found to play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, cardiac cell growth and death, and cardiac fibroblast functions. Accordingly, miR-21 is proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above-mentioned cardiovascular diseases as demonstrated by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. This review article summarizes the research progress regarding the roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular disease. Remarkably, miR-21 was one of most upregulated miRNAs in hearts after IP. In vivo, IP-mediated cardiac protection against ischaemia/reperfusion injury was inhibited by knockdown of cardiac miR-21. In cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 also had a protective effect on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene, programmed cell death 4. The protective effect of miR-21 on cardiac cell apoptosis was further confirmed in rat hearts after ischaemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. Remarkably, miR-21 expression was significantly down-regulated in infarcted areas, but was up-regulated in border areas. The down-regulation of miR-21 in the infarcted areas was inhibited by ischemic preconditioning, a known cardiac protective method. Overexpression of miR-21 via adenovirus expressing miR-21 (Ad-miR-21) decreased myocardial infarct size by 29% at 24 h and decreased the dimension of left ventricles at 2 weeks after AMI. Using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 had a protective effect on ischemia-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene programmed cell death 4 and activator protein 1 pathway. The protective effect of miR-21 against ischemia-induced cardiac myocyte damage was further confirmed in vivo by decreased cell apoptosis in the border and infarcted areas of the infarcted rat hearts after treatment with Ad-miR-21. The results suggest that miRNAs such as miR-21 may play critical roles in the early phase of AMI. The results suggest that miR-21 is sensitive to H(2)O(2) stimulation. miR-21 participates in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and functional modulation in cardiac myocytes. miR-21 might play an essential role in heart diseases related to ROS such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts Myocardial and circulating levels of microRNA-21 reflect left ventricular fibrosis in aortic stenosis patients MicroRNA 21 inhibits left ventricular remodeling in the early phase of rat model with ischemia-reperfusion injury by suppressing cell apoptosis MicroRNA-21 protects against the H(2)O(2)-induced injury on cardiac myocytes via its target gene PDCD4 MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases MicroRNA-21 as therapeutic target in cancer and cardiovascular disease. These findings reveal that microRNAs can contribute to myocardial disease by an effect in cardiac fibroblasts. Our results validate miR-21 as a disease target in heart failure and establish the therapeutic efficacy of microRNA therapeutic intervention in a cardiovascular disease setting."
Is clathrin involved in E-cadherin endocytosis?,yes,"We demonstrated that GnT-III induced a stabilizing effect on E-cadherin at the cell membrane by inducing a delay in the turnover rate of the protein, contributing for the formation of stable and functional adherens-junctions, and further preventing clathrin-dependent E-cadherin endocytosis. Conversely, GnT-V promotes the destabilization of E-cadherin, leading to its mislocalization and unstable adherens-junctions with impairment of cell-cell adhesion. Here we show that E-cadherin polarity is controlled by the polarized regulation of clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis. We delineate a pathway that controls the initiation of E-cadherin endocytosis through the regulation of AP2 and clathrin coat recruitment by E-cadherin. Clathrin dependent endocytosis of E-cadherin is regulated by the Arf6GAP isoform SMAP1 E-cadherin is a central component of the adherens junction in epithelial cells and continuously undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolae depending on the cell type. Collectively, SMAP1 likely represents a key Arf6GAP in clathrin dependent endocytosis of E-cadherin in MDCK cells. Consistent with these observations, we found that selective uncoupling of p120 from E-cadherin by introduction of amino acid substitutions in the p120-binding site increased the level of E-cadherin endocytosis. The increased endocytosis was clathrin-dependent, because it was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin or by hypertonic shock. We found that in this experimental system E-cadherin entered a transferrin-negative compartment before transport to the early endosomal compartment, where it merged with classical clathrin-mediated uptake pathways."
Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,yes,"Mechanistically, mTORC1 mediated IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, mTORC1 signaling critically protects against inflammatory bowel disease through modulation of inflammation-induced Stat3 activity. we demonstrated that STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1 expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process Furthermore, we demonstrated that STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process.  TSC1/TSC2 inactivation inhibits AKT through mTORC1-dependent up-regulation of STAT3-PTEN cascade. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1 expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).  Suppression of the mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 pathway by activated AMPK prevents hepatic insulin resistance induced by excess amino acids. Here, we review the connections between mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular processes in physiological and pathological contexts."
Doesn't do the hERG gene code for a protein which is part of a sodium channel?,yes,"The human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG 1a) potassium channel is critical for cardiac repolarization Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels conduct delayed rectifier K(+) current.  The KvLQT1 and minK genes code the slowly activating, delayed rectifier (Iks) potassium channel, the HERG gene code the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier (Ikr) potassium channel of the heart, while the SCN5A gene codes a cardiac sodium channel. The molecular basis of inherited disorders caused by a mutation in either the gene coding for a particular potassium channel called HERG-or another gene, SCN5A, which codes for the sodium channel and disruption of which results in a loss of inactivation of the Na+ current. The aim of this study was to test whether a recently reported polymorphism in the HERG gene coding for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel has influence on myocardial repolarization. Mutations in KvLQT1, minK and HERG genes affects repolarising, rectifier potassium currents, while SCN5A mutations cause delayed inactivation and reopening of the cardiac sodium channel, which initiates the depolarisation of cardiac cells. A human genetic defect associated with 'long Q-T syndrome', an abnormality of cardiac rhythm involving the repolarization of the action potential, was recently found to lie in the HERG gene, which codes for a potassium channel. Therefore, matrine and oxymatrine may have the potential to cure LQT2 as a potassium channel activator by promoting hERG channel activation and increasing hERG channel expression. The human delta1261 mutation of the HERG potassium channel results in a truncated protein that contains a subunit interaction domain and decreases the channel expression. HERG (human eag-related gene) encodes an inward-rectifier potassium channel formed by the assembly of four subunits. The human ether-?-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel in the heart. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr) important for cardiac repolarization. Role of glycosylation in cell surface expression and stability of HERG potassium channels. The human ERG protein (HERG or Kv 11.1) encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) is the pore-forming subunit of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) responsible for action potential (AP) repolarization Human ether-a-go-go related gene (herg) encoding HERG K(+) channel has been demonstrated in many previous studies with its association to cell cycle progression and growth in tumor cells A human genetic defect associated with 'long Q-T syndrome', an abnormality of cardiac rhythm involving the repolarization of the action potential, was recently found to lie in the HERG gene, which codes for a potassium channel.  Drug-induced long QT syndrome: hERG K+ channel block and disruption of protein trafficking by fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test whether a recently reported polymorphism in the HERG gene coding for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel has influence on myocardial repolarization.  The aim of this study was to test whether the K897T polymorphism of the KCNH2 (HERG) gene coding for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel influences cardiac repolarization assessed by principal component analysis (PCA) of T-wave morphology.  The KvLQT1 and minK genes code the slowly activating, delayed rectifier (Iks) potassium channel, the HERG gene code the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier (Ikr) potassium channel of the heart, while the SCN5A gene codes a cardiac sodium channel. All code for subunits of sodium or potassium channels: two a subunits of the potassium channels (QVLQT1 for LQT1, HERG for LQT2), the a subunit of the sodium channel INa (SCN5A for LQT3), and two regulatory subunits of potassium channels (KCNE1 for LQT5 regulating the KvLQT1 channel and MiRP1 regulating HERG). The corresponding genes code for potassium channels KVLQT1 (LQT1) and HERG (LQT2) and the sodium channel SCN5A (LQT3). The molecular basis of inherited disorders caused by a mutation in either the gene coding for a particular potassium channel called HERG-or another gene, SCN5A, which codes for the sodium channel and disruption of which results in a loss of inactivation of the Na+ current. There may also be correlation between the strength of binding of the medicinal substance to the potassium channel coded by the HERG gene and prolongation of the QT interval. We demonstrate that the mRNA 3'UTR of ppk29 affects neuronal firing rates and associated heat-induced seizures by acting as a natural antisense transcript (NAT) that regulates the neuronal mRNA levels of seizure (sei), the Drosophila homolog of the human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel. Mutations in KvLQT1, minK and HERG genes affects repolarising, rectifier potassium currents, while SCN5A mutations cause delayed inactivation and reopening of the cardiac sodium channel, which initiates the depolarisation of cardiac cells. Among the congenital forms, particularly interest is focused on the potassium channel coded by the HERG gene located on chromosome 7 and with a key role in the normal electric cardiac activity. By employing heterologous expression and making comparisons to cells expressing wild-type human-ether-a-go-go-related protein (HERG), a potassium channel that contributes to I(Kr) current in ventricular cardiomyocytes, we demonstrate activation of an elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by the mutant I593R HERG potassium channel implicated in long QT syndrome type 2.

Isn't EZH2 associated with prostate cancer?,no,"The role of EZH2 in the regulation of the activity of matrix metalloproteinases in prostate cancer cells EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells The TIMP genes are derepressed by knockdown of EZH2 expression in human prostate cancer cells but repressed by overexpression of EZH2 in benign human prostate epithelial cells. Overexpression of EZH2 confers an invasive phenotype on benign prostate epithelial cells EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9, thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells he transcriptional repression of the TIMP genes by EZH2 may be a major mechanism to shift the MMPs/TIMPs balance in favor of MMP activity and thus to promote ECM degradation and subsequent invasion of prostate cancer cells. Expression levels of the novel tumor and metastasis suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) have been shown to correlate negatively with those of EZH2 in breast and prostate cell lines as well as in clinical cancer tissues Polycomb protein EZH2 regulates tumor invasion via the transcriptional repression of the metastasis suppressor RKIP in breast and prostate cancer Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which encodes the histone methyltransferase component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed widely in breast and prostate cancers and epigenetically silences tumor suppressor genes However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of EZH2 in prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) remain unknown c-Myc, EZH2 and p27 were defined to modulate the behavior of prostate cancer with pro-tumoral or anti-tumoral effects and had ability in predicting prostate cancer progression, but the research of their co-expression value of prognosis is rarely Composite index of c-Myc, EZH2, and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery, and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly. EZH2, an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer. The histone methyltransferase EZH2 has been in the limelight of the field of cancer epigenetics for a decade now since it was first discovered to exhibit an elevated expression in metastatic prostate cancer a comprehensive overview of EZH2 in the context of prostate cancer EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer ChIP data on prostate cancer tissue specimens and cell lines suggested EZH2 occupancy and H3K27Me3 marks on the ID4 promoter Collectively, our data indicate a PRC2 dependent mechanism in ID4 promoter silencing in prostate cancer through recruitment of EZH2 and a corresponding increase in H3K27Me3. Increased EZH2 but decreased ID4 expression in prostate cancer strongly supports this model. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has recently attracted considerable attention because of its dysregulation in prostate cancer (PCa) and its important function in PCa development.  Autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 as a driving force for prostate cancer development Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. The data show that amplification of the EZH2 gene is rare in early prostate cancer, whereas a fraction of late-stage tumors contains the gene amplification leading to the overexpression of the gene, thus indicating the importance of EZH2 in the progression of prostate cancer. EZH2 expression in prostate cancer correlates with progression to hormone-refractory and metastatic disease, but it is unknown whether EZH2 plays a specific role in the acquisition of an advanced prostate cancer phenotype. Although prior studies in prostate cancer have revealed a number of possible mechanisms of EZH2 upregulation, these changes cannot account for the overexpression EZH2 in many primary prostate cancers, nor in most cases of high grade PIN. As a result, five EZH2 peptides recognized by IgG (EZH2 120-128, EZH2 165-174, EZH2 569-577, EZH2 665-674, and EZH2 699-708) were frequently detected in the plasma of prostate cancer patients. Thus, dysregulated expression of EZH2 may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer, as well as being a marker that distinguishes indolent prostate cancer from those at risk of lethal progression. These results link two major pathways in prostate cancer by providing two additional and complementary Myc-regulated mechanisms by which EZH2 upregulation occurs and is enforced during prostatic carcinogenesis. EZH2 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. EZH2 promotes proliferation and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. The Polycomb Group protein EZH2 is implicated in prostate cancer progression. The polycomb group protein EZH2 is involved in progression of prostate cancer. Mutation screen and association study of EZH2 as a susceptibility gene for aggressive prostate cancer. Expression changes in EZH2, but not in BMI-1, SIRT1, DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer. The gene for polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is amplified in late-stage prostate cancer. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a kind of transcriptional repressor, is reportedly over-expressed in metastatic prostate cancer. IgGs reactive to three EZH2 peptides (EZH2-243 to -252, EZH2-291 to -299, and EZH2-735 to -;742) were detected in the plasma of almost half of prostate cancer patients. Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. Overexpression of EZH2 has been associated with the invasion and progression of malignant cancers, especially with the progression of prostate cancer. Antigens overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer are appropriate targets in anti-cancer immunotherapy, and one candidate is the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2).  Cytoplasmic EZH2 is expressed at low levels in benign prostate epithelial cells and over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples. DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer. EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence in a training set of 103 patients (relative risk [RR] = 2.52, a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer. PcG proteins EZH2, BMI1, and RING1 are associated with adverse pathologic features and clinical PSA recurrence of prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, Elevation of the chromatin repression factor enhancer of zeste homolog (EZH2) is associated with progression and poor prognosis in several human cancers including prostate cancer. Various proteins (α2-integrin, α6-integrin, CD117, CD133, EZH2, OCT3/4) are associated with a prostate cancer stem cell phenotype in cell lines and xenografts. Increased expression of EZH2 has been associated previously with invasive growth and aggressive clinical behavior in prostate and breast cancer, EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy and may be useful in defining a cohort of high-risk patients. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, including tumor stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. EZH2 expression is associated with high proliferation rate and aggressive tumor subgroups in cutaneous melanoma and cancers of the endometrium, prostate, and breast. Moderate or strong expression of EZH2 coupled with at most moderate expression of ECAD (i.e., a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer. Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples."
Isn't peripheral neuroepithelioma related to Ewing sarcoma?,no,"The term ""small round-cell tumor"" describes a group of highly aggressive malignant tumors composed of relatively small and monotonous undifferentiated cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios. This group includes Ewing's sarcoma (ES), peripheral neuroepithelioma (aka, primitive neuroectodermal tumor or extraskeletal ES), peripheral neuroblastoma (""classic-type""), rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round-cell tumor, lymphoma, leukemia, small-cell osteosarcoma, small-cell carcinoma (either undifferentiated or neuroendocrine), olfactory neuroblastoma, cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma (aka, Merkel-cell carcinoma), small-cell melanoma, and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Their clinical presentations often overlap, thus making a definitive diagnosis problematic in some cases AIMS: To retrospectively study the DNA content in a series of childhood Ewing Family Tumors (EFT), and to investigate its prognostic value. METHODS: The study was performed on a series of 27 EFTs (osseous Ewing's sarcoma, 18 cases; extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma, 2; peripheral neuroepithelioma, 4; Askin Rosai tumors, 3 To improve the prognosis of patients with poor-risk peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pPNETs; including peripheral neuroepithelioma and Ewing's sarcoma) Large group of small-round-cell tumours of soft tissues and bone represents a complex diagnostic problem for the pathologists. Neuronal nature of many tumours from this group is proven by means of new methods--immunophenotypic analysis, tissue culture, cytogenetics. Peripheral neuroepithelioma, Ewing tumour, primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET), Askin tumour belong to these neoplasms Comparison of Ewing's sarcoma of bone and peripheral neuroepithelioma. An immunocytochemical and ultrastructural analysis of two primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms Ewing's sarcoma of bone (ESB) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are frequently considered to be different tumors. Some researchers have suggested that PN is morphologically a neuroectodermal Ewing's sarcoma. We sought to determine the extent of neuroectodermal features in conventional ESB on direct patient material (25 cases) and to compare these tumors with a similar group of readily diagnosed PNs (10 cases) Neuroectodermal antigens (neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7 [HNK-1], neurofilament 200 kd, and S100) were found in nine of 10 cases of PN and in 17 of 25 cases of ESB These data support the concept that ESB and PN are both peripheral primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms, differing only in extent of neuroectodermal phenotype and morphological differentiation Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin. Ewings sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs). The presence of this translocation in Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor has been taken as evidence that these two tumors are related. Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin. Indistinguishable patterns of protooncogene expression in two distinct but closely related tumors: Ewing's sarcoma and neuroepithelioma. Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12). Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (ES/pPNET) are a group of small round cell sarcomas that show varying degrees of neuroectodermal differentiation characterized by translocation involving the EWS gene Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs) Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) This genetical similarity further supports a nosological concept according to which Askin's tumour, Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma represent phenotypic variations of the same tumour, namely the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour. Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin"
Doesn't the 3D structure of the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,yes,"We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression. The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an important role in the control of gene expression Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. Many studies have suggested a link between the spatial organization of genomes and fundamental biological processes such as genome reprogramming, gene expression, and differentiation. Moreover, we reveal that formation of such highly condensed, transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin promotes transcriptional activation of differentiation genes and loss of pluripotency. The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. we find that localized heterochromatin condensation of ribosomal RNA genes initiates establishment of highly condensed chromatin structures outside of the nucleolus We focus on the emerging relationship between genome organization and lineage-specific transcriptional regulation, which we argue are inextricably linked. Cells face the challenge of storing two meters of DNA in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus that spans only a few microns. The nuclear organization that is required to overcome this challenge must allow for the accessibility of the gene regulatory machinery to the DNA and, in the case of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), for the transcriptional and epigenetic changes that accompany differentiation In this review we summarize some of the recent findings illuminating the 3D structure of the eukaryotic genome, as well as the relationship between genome topology and function from the level of whole chromosomes to enhancer-promoter loops with a focus on features affecting genome organization in ESCs and changes in nuclear organization during differentiation We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome"
Isn't Doxorubicin cardiotoxic?,no,"Doxorubicin (DOXO) is widely used to treat solid tumors. However, its clinical use is limited by side effects including serious cardiotoxicity due to cardiomyocyte damage.  The results provide direct evidence for the role of catalase in doxorubicin cardiotoxic responses. These results do not support the possibility that mitomycin C potentiates the acute cardiotoxic effects produced by doxorubicin. The anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin is converted by the enzyme carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) into its cardiotoxic metabolite doxorubicinol The clinical efficiency of the highly potent antitumor agent doxorubicin is limited by cardiotoxic effects Doxorubicin (DOX), a highly active chemotherapeutic drug, faces limitations in clinical application due to severe cardiotoxic effects (mainly through increased oxidative stress) Clinical uses of doxorubicin (DOX), a highly active anticancer agent, are limited by its severe cardiotoxic side effects associated with increased oxidative stress and apoptosis Doxorubicin (DOX) and trastuzumab (TRZ) are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents in the breast cancer setting, limited by their cardiotoxic side effects Twisting and ironing: doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by mitochondrial DNA damage. Cardiotoxic effects were reported in 15 (5%) of 291 children receiving treatment including doxorubicin. On the other hand, pretreatment of rats with hesperidin protected cardiac tissues against the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin as evidenced from amelioration of histopathological changes and normalization of cardiac biochemical parameters.Hesperidin may have a protective effect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. However, with cumulative doses, doxorubicin also is known to have cardiotoxic effects, including cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Methods of reducing or preventing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity have been suggested, including an investigational doxorubicin analog, mitoxantrone ( Novantrone ). The most cardiotoxic drug, doxorubicin, is the most potent inducer of superoxide generation, while epirubicin, which is less cardiotoxic, has a relatively limited effect on superoxide production. The mechanism of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is likely multifactorial and most importantly, the genetic factors predisposing to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity are unknown. As doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is considered irreversible, early detection of cardiotoxicity and prevention of overt heart failure is essential. Although there are monitoring guidelines for cardiotoxicity, optimal timing for early detection of subclinical doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is still obscure. Quercetin attenuates doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by modulating Bmi-1 expression. However, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity of the heart has largely limited its clinical use. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I (top1mt) is a novel limiting factor of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy induces cardiotoxicity, which limits its clinical application. he clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) and other anthracyclines is limited by a dosage-dependent cardiotoxicity, which can lead to cardiomyopathy.  Besides its cardiotoxic effect, doxorubicin also elicits inflammatory effects in vivo. 7-Monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) has recently been used as a protector against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo. Doxorubicin is an effective antineoplastic agent, but it frequently causes dose-related cardiotoxic effects.  Among these analogs, idarubicin (4-demethoxy-daunorubicin) was shown to be less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin i Verapamil has also been suggested to potentiate the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin.  Doxorubicin treatment is associated with both acute and chronic cardiotoxicity.  cardiac effects of diclofenac sodium on doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats"
Are mutations in the nf1 gene associated with memory?,yes,"We hypothesized that NF1 mutations disturb the expression of genes important for memory formation Our previous work has shown that defective cAMP signaling leads to the learning phenotype in Drosophila Nf1 mutants.

Is treatment resistant depression related to vitamin B9?,yes,"Suboptimal serum and red blood cell folate levels have been associated with a poorer response to antidepressant therapy, a greater severity of symptoms, later onset of clinical improvement, and overall treatment resistance. This article reviews the evidence for L-methylfolate and folic acid as antidepressive agents in depression and discusses their clinical use Although further randomized controlled trials in this area appear warranted, SAMe and L-methylfolate may represent a useful addition to the AD armamentarium. Patients with depression have consistently been found to have lower levels of serum and red blood cell folate than normal or nondepressed psychiatric patients. Decreased folate levels have been associated with lowered response rates to standard antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Recent studies have shown that augmentation with a folate supplement increases medication response in both treatment-naïve and treatment-resistant depressed patients irrespective of whether there is folate deficiency. Depressed patients with both low and normal folate levels may benefit from augmenting a primary antidepressant medication either initially, at the onset of treatment, or later after some degree of treatment resistance has been recognized. The results of this study suggest that intake of vitamin B9 may modulate the total score of Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and two subscales of the CES-D including depressive affect and interpersonal difficulties.

Isn't micro RNA 1 (miR-1) implicated in cardiac arrhythmias?,no,"Dysfunction of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43), an established miR-1 target, during cardiac hypertrophy leads to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). miR-1 overexpression may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the heart to AVB, which provides us novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic cardiac arrhythmias. The incidence of AVB was higher in miR-1 Tg mice than that in wild-type (WT) mice.  As miR-1 has been shown in animal models and clinical studies to contribute to arrhythmogenesis by regulating pacemaker channel genes, our finding of miR-1 up-regulation in patients with myocardial infarction indicates that it might be responsible for the higher risk for arrhythmias in these patients.  Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) reciprocally regulates inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir)2.1 expression in coronary disease, contributing to arrhythmogenesis.  miR-1 levels are greatly reduced in human AF, possibly contributing to up-regulation of Kir2.1 subunits, leading to increased I(K1). Because up-regulation of inward-rectifier currents is important for AF maintenance, these results provide potential new insights into molecular mechanisms of AF with potential therapeutic implications. The muscle-specific miR-1 has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, heart development, cardiac stem cell differentiation, and arrhythmias through targeting of regulatory proteins.  We conclude that the beta-adrenergic pathway can stimulate expression of arrhythmogenic miR-1, contributing to ischaemic arrhythmogenesis, and beta-blockers produce their beneficial effects partially by down-regulating miR-1, which might be a novel strategy for ischaemic cardioprotection. MiR-1 influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure. In the presence of isoproterenol, rhythmically paced, miR-1-overexpressing myocytes exhibited spontaneous arrhythmogenic oscillations of intracellular Ca(2+), events that occurred rarely in control myocytes under the same conditions. Here we show that miR-1 is overexpressed in individuals with coronary artery disease, and that when overexpressed in normal or infarcted rat hearts, it exacerbates arrhythmogenesis. Elimination of miR-1 by an antisense inhibitor in infarcted rat hearts relieved arrhythmogenesis.  Thus, miR-1 may have important pathophysiological functions in the heart, and is a potential antiarrhythmic target.

Hasn't silicon been used in treatment of incontinence ?,no,"an artificial anal sphincter. Worldwide, there are two established devices on the market: the artificial bowel sphincter® (ABS) from A. M. S. (Minnetonka, MN, USA) and the soft anal band® from A. M. I. (Feldkirch, Austria). How to implant the artificial anal sphincter? Both devices consist of a silicon cuff which can be filled with fluid. The InVance™ system uses a silicon-coated polyester sling positioned under the bulbar urethra via a perineal incision. Through a perineal incision three titanium screws with a polipropylene suture were inserted in each ischiopubic rami, and a silicon/polipropylene mesh (Invance) is affixed to them, compressing the bulbar urethra surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with a trans-obturator sub-urethral tape of Uratape (Porgés). METHODS: Treatment and follow up of their complication were performed at the CHRU of Lille. RESULTS: In both cases, this complication is related to prolonged vaginal exposition of the tape. Vaginal erosion always occurs next to the silicon coated section of the tape A non-elastic, polypropylene tape (UraTape, Mentor-Porgès) with a silicon coated central part was placed under the mid-urethra.

Is aganglionic megacolon a feature of Down syndrome?,yes,"Down syndrome (DS) is recognized by characteristic facial features, intellectual disability, and an increased risk for cardiac malformations and duodenal atresia. Recently, Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, has been seen more often among patients with DS Of the 17 patients with HD who were studied, 10 were isolated (58.8%) and seven (41.1%) were associated to other structural abnormalities and psychomotor retardation. Three of the cases in this latter group were due to chromosome pathology (trisomy 21, Down syndrome) The authors report the case of a female infant with Down syndrome, aganglionic megacolon, severe diarrhea, and jejunal biopsy with ultrastructural changes consistent with microvillous atrophy. The patient condition improved after a colostomy performed in the setting of the treatment of Hirschprung disease Hirschsprung disease, or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is commonly assumed to be a sex-modified multifactorial trait. To test this hypothesis, complex segregation analysis was performed on data on 487 probands and their families. Demographic information on probands and the recurrence risk to relatives of probands are presented. An increased sex ratio (3.9 male:female) and an elevated risk to sibs (4%), as compared with the population incidence (0.02%), are observed, with the sex ratio decreasing and the recurrence risk to sibs increasing as the aganglionosis becomes more extensive. Down syndrome was found at an increased frequency among affected individuals but not among their unaffected sibs, and the increase was not associated with maternal age Intestinal microvillous atrophy in a patient with Down syndrome and aganglionic megacolon.

Is phospholamban a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Ca ATPase SERCA?,yes,"The membrane protein complex between the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLN) controls Ca(2+) transport in cardiomyocytes, thereby modulating cardiac contractility. β-Adrenergic-stimulated phosphorylation of PLN at Ser-16 enhances SERCA activity via an unknown mechanism. Phospholamban (PLN) is a type II membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), thereby regulating calcium homeostasis in cardiac muscle. In membranes, PLN forms pentamers that have been proposed to function either as a storage for active monomers or as ion channels. Regulation of the SERCA calcium pump by phospholamban (PLB) is largely due to interactions between their respective transmembrane domains. In spite of numerous mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we still do not have a clear mechanistic picture of how PLB influences the calcium transport cycle of SERCA. Calcium transport across the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart muscle contraction and relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) 2a is responsible for Ca(2+) up-take by this organelle and is inhibited in a reversible manner by phospholamban, another SR membrane protein. Thus, alleviation of phospholamban-mediated inhibition of SERCA2a is a potential therapeutic option for heart failure and cardiomyopathy. Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac contractility and functional cardiac reserve. Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and this inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylation These findings suggest that PLB is an important modulator of gastric antrum smooth muscle contractility by modulation of SR Ca(2+) release and CaM kinase II activity. The function of the SERCA pump is modulated by the endogenous molecules phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN), expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. The mechanism of action of PLB on SERCA is well characterized, whereas that of SLN is only beginning to be understood.   Phospholamban (PLB) is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). These results show that alteration of the PLB:SERCA ratio can significantly modulate smooth muscle [Ca2+]i. Phospholamban expressed in cardiac muscle and sarcolipin expressed in skeletal muscle regulate SERCA activity. Phospholamban (PLB) is a 24- to 27-kDa phosphoprotein that modulates activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). Expression of PLB is reportedly limited to cardiac, slow-twitch skeletal and smooth muscle in which PLB is an important regulator of [Ca2+]i and contractility in these muscles. Regulation of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA 2a) depends on the phosphorylation state of phospholamban (PLB). When PLB is phosphorylated, its inhibitory effect towards SERCA 2a is relieved, leading to an enhanced myocardial performance.   Ca(2+) reuptake occurs via sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and is regulated by the inhibitory protein phospholamban (PLB) in many cell types. Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban (PLN) is the endogenous inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), the integral membrane enzyme responsible for 70�% of the removal of Ca(2+) from the cytosol, inducing cardiac muscle relaxation in humans. Phospholamban (PLB) is an integral membrane protein regulating Ca(2+) transport through inhibitory interaction with sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA). Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) We used EPR spectroscopy to probe directly the interaction between phospholamban (PLB) and its regulatory target, the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA)"
Is ocular melanosis a risk factor for uveal melanoma?,yes,"Ocular/oculodermal (oculo[dermal]) melanocytosis is a congenital periocular pigmentary condition that can lead to the development of uveal melanoma, estimated at 1 in 400 affected patients. Melanosis oculi is often underestimated as a risk factor for uveal melanoma and glaucoma. Ophthalmic surveillance, every 6 or 12 months is important, in patients with ocular melanocytosis for early detection of high risk diseases.  One of about 400 patients with ODM followed for life is estimated to develop uveal melanoma. Excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in ODM may provide the biologic basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma. Patients with ODM should be monitored ophthalmoscopically, especially during the susceptible period, for the development of uveal melanoma. The authors suggest that a national registry of ODM patients be created and prospective data collected to better assess the risk of developing uveal melanoma. In the white population, an association between oculo(dermal) melanocytosis (ODM) and uveal melanoma is well recognized.  Malignant melanomas may arise in the uveal tract, the conjunctiva, the skin of the eyelid, or the orbit. Risk factors so far identified include pre-existing choroidal naevi for uveal melanomas, primary acquired melanosis (PAM) for conjunctival tumours, and ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis for uveal and orbital lesions.

It occurs more commonly in middle-aged and elderly women and often affects the tongue tip and lateral borders, lips, and hard and soft palate.  BMS is a chronic disorder that frequently affects women and is characterised by burning symptoms of the oral mucosa without clinical signs. It mostly affects elderly citizens, especially postmenopausal women with prevalence up to 12-18%."
Aren't chromomethylases present in animal genomes?,yes,"Many plant, animal, and fungal genomes contain cytosine DNA methylation in asymmetric sequence contexts (CpHpH, H = A, T, C). However, at the SUPERMAN locus, asymmetric methylation was only completely abolished in drm1 drm2 chromomethylase 3 (cmt3) triple mutant plants. Although neither the drm1 drm2 double mutants nor the cmt3 single mutants show morphological defects, drm1 drm2 cmt3 triple mutant plants show pleiotropic effects on plant development. Arabidopsis cmt3 chromomethylase mutations block non-CG methylation and silencing of an endogenous gene. The lack of CMT homologs in animal genomes could account for the observation that in contrast to plants, animals maintain primarily CG methylation. Dual binding of chromomethylase domains to H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes directs DNA methylation in plants. A role for CHROMOMETHYLASE3 in mediating transposon and euchromatin silencing during egg cell reprogramming in Arabidopsis. During embryogenesis there is a major switch from dependence upon maternally-deposited products to reliance on products of the zygotic genome. Expression analysis of eight putative tomato DNA methyltransferases encoding genes showed that one chromomethylase (CMT) and two rearranged methyltransferases (DRMs) are preferentially expressed in the pericarp during fruit growth and could be involved in the locus-specific increase of methylation observed at this developmental phase in the pericarp. Natural variation for alleles under epigenetic control by the maize chromomethylase zmet2. Arabidopsis has two types of methyltransferases with demonstrated maintenance activity: MET1, which maintains CpG methylation and is homologous to mammalian DNMT1, and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), which maintains CpNpG (N = A, T, C, or G) methylation and is unique to the plant kingdom. Maize chromomethylase Zea methyltransferase2 is required for CpNpG methylation. A cytosine DNA methyltransferase containing a chromodomain, Zea methyltransferase2 (Zmet2), was cloned from maize. The sequence of ZMET2 is similar to that of the Arabidopsis chromomethylases CMT1 and CMT3, with C-terminal motifs characteristic of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases. We have detected a chromodomain embedded within the catalytic region of a predicted Arabidopsis DNA methyltransferase that is diverged from other eukaryotic enzymes. The 791 residue ""chromomethylase"" (CMT1) is encoded by a floral transcript that is spliced from 20 exons and is present at only approximately 1/10(-7) of total mRNA."
Does the association of PARP1 and CTCF follow a circadian rhythm?,yes,"here we uncovered an inter-chromosomal network connecting active loci enriched in circadian genes to repressed lamina-associated domains (LADs). Synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CTCF interactions, which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina, followed by the acquisition of repressive H3K9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation PARP1- and CTCF-regulated contacts between circadian loci and the repressive chromatin environment at the lamina therefore mediate circadian transcriptional plasticity. Synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CTCF interactions, which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina, followed by the acquisition of repressive H3K9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation. Furthermore, depletion of H3K9me2/3, inhibition of PARP activity by olaparib, or downregulation of PARP1 or CTCF expression counteracts both recruitment to the envelope and circadian transcription. PARP1- and CTCF-regulated contacts between circadian loci and the repressive chromatin environment at the lamina therefore mediate circadian transcriptional plasticity. transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin domains tend to segregate into separate sub nuclear compartments to maintain stable expression patterns however here we uncovered an inter chromosomal network connecting active loci enriched in circadian genes to repressed lamina associated domains lads the interactome is regulated by parp1 and its co factor ctcf they not only mediate chromatin fiber interactions but also promote the recruitment of circadian genes to the lamina synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in parp1 ctcf interactions which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina followed by the acquisition of repressive h3k9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation furthermore depletion of h3k9me2 3 inhibition of parp activity by olaparib or downregulation of parp1 or ctcf expression counteracts both recruitment to the envelope and circadian transcription parp1 and ctcf regulated contacts between circadian loci and the repressive chromatin environment at the lamina therefore mediate circadian transcriptional plasticity.

Isn't there a link between nuclear position and DNA repair pathway choice?,no,"Nuclear position dictates DNA repair pathway choice. We demonstrate that DSBs induced at the nuclear membrane (but not at nuclear pores or nuclear interior) fail to rapidly activate the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair by homologous recombination (HR). Real-time and superresolution imaging reveal that DNA DSBs within lamina-associated domains do not migrate to more permissive environments for HR, like the nuclear pores or the nuclear interior, but instead are repaired in situ by alternative end-joining. Our results are consistent with a model in which nuclear position dictates the choice of DNA repair pathway, thus revealing a new level of regulation in DSB repair controlled by spatial organization of DNA within the nucleus. Our results are consistent with a model in which nuclear position dictates the choice of DNA repair pathway, thus revealing a new level of regulation in DSB repair controlled by spatial organization of DNA within the nucleus.

Isn't there any link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B?,no,The aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B combine to regulate active promoters in quiescent lymphocytes. We show that the Aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein Ring1B have essential roles in regulating transcriptionally active genes in quiescent lymphocytes. Ring1B and Aurora B bind to a wide range of active promoters in resting B and T cells. Conditional knockout of either protein results in reduced transcription and binding of RNA Pol II to promoter regions and decreased cell viability. Aurora B phosphorylates histone H3S28 at active promoters in resting B cells as well as inhibiting Ring1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes. Our results identify a mechanism for regulating transcription in quiescent cells that has implications for epigenetic regulation of the choice between proliferation and quiescence. We show that the Aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein Ring1B have essential roles in regulating transcriptionally active genes in quiescent lymphocytes.

Is NOD1 activated in inflammation?,yes,"Nod1 and Nod2 control bacterial infections and inflammation The Nod proteins Nod1 and Nod2 are two NLR family members that trigger immune defense in response to bacterial peptidoglycan Nod proteins fight off bacterial infections by stimulating proinflammatory signaling and cytokine networks and by inducing antimicrobial effectors, such as nitric oxide and antimicrobial peptides. Nod1 is also critically implicated in shaping adaptive immune responses towards bacterial-derived constituents. Together, Nod1 and Nod2 represent central players in the control of immune responses to bacterial infections and inflammation. The innate immune receptor Nod1 protects the intestine from inflammation-induced tumorigenesis. we show that Nod1 deficiency results in the increased development of both colitis-associated and Apc tumor suppressor-related colon tumors. In the absence of Nod1 signaling, there is a greater disruption of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier due to chemically induced injury as manifested by increased surface epithelial apoptosis early on during chemically induced colitis and increased intestinal permeability. The increased intestinal permeability is associated with enhanced inflammatory cytokine production and epithelial cell proliferation in Nod1-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice. Depletion of the gut microbiota suppressed tumor development in Nod1-deficient mice, thus highlighting a link between the commensal bacteria within the intestine and the host innate immune Nod1 signaling pathway in the regulation inflammation-mediated colon cancer development.  NOD1 protein is expressed in the eye and promotes ocular inflammation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion.  NOD1 expression in the eye and functional contribution to IL-1beta-dependent ocular inflammation in mice Polymorphisms in NOD1 are associated with autoinflammatory diseases characterized by uveitis such as Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis NOD1 is homologous to NOD2, which is responsible for an autosomal dominant form of uveitis. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model mice deficient for both Nod1 and Nod2 had attenuated inflammatory pathology, reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, and increased colonization of the mucosal tissue The present study has demonstrated an unexpected role of Nod1 in the development of site-specific vascular inflammation, especially coronary arteritis. Nod1 ligands induce site-specific vascular inflammation Phenotyping of Nod1/2 double deficient mice and characterization of Nod1/2 in systemic inflammation and associated renal disease The present study analyzed Nod1 and Nod2 double deficient (Nod1/2 DKO) mice under physiological and inflammatory conditions Several inflammatory disorders, such as Crohn's disease and asthma, are linked to genetic changes in either Nod1 or Nod2. Systematic analysis of Nod1/2 DKO mice revealed a possible role of Nod1/2 in the development of renal disease during systemic inflammation. NOD1 and NOD2 Signaling in Infection and Inflammation NOD1 engagement generates an inflammatory response via activation of NFκB and MAPK pathways.  In addition we profile novel inhibitors of RIP2 and NOD1 itself, which specifically inhibit NOD1 ligand induced inflammatory signalling in the vasculature.  This data supports the potential utility of NOD1 and RIP2 as therapeutic targets in human disease where vascular inflammation is a clinical feature, such as in sepsis and septic shock. NOD1 expression elicited by iE-DAP in first trimester human trophoblast cells and its potential role in infection-associated inflammation This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of NOD1 in first trimester trophoblast cells, and evaluate the potential role of trophoblast cells in infection-associated inflammation NOD1 may have a role in mediating infection-associated inflammation. Once iE-DAP is recognized by NOD1, the inflammatory response may be induced via NOD1-RICK-NF-κB-mediated pathways. NOD1/2(-/-) mice were protected from HFD-induced inflammation, lipid accumulation, and peripheral insulin intolerance. In contrast, Nod1 gene-deficient mice developed enhanced joint inflammation with concomitant elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cartilage damage, consistent with a model in which Nod1 controls the inflammatory reaction. These data indicate that the NLR family members Nod1 and Nod2 have different functions in controlling inflammation, and that intracellular Nod1-Nod2 interactions may determine the severity of arthritis in this experimental model. Whereas the lymphotoxin pathway was critical for the induction of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 in response to Nod1 agonists, B cell accumulation within the spleen following Nod1-induced systemic inflammation was independent of the lymphotoxin pathway. The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. A key role for the endothelium in NOD1 mediated vascular inflammation: comparison to TLR4 responses. We previously demonstrated that human first-trimester trophoblasts express Nod1 and Nod2, which trigger inflammation upon stimulation. In addition, recent studies have revealed a role for intracellular NOD1 receptors in the regulation of vascular inflammation and metabolism. In conclusion, the present findings describe an important role for NOD1 in the development of insulin resistance and inflammation in pregnancies complicated by GDM. Phenotyping of Nod1/2 double deficient mice and characterization of Nod1/2 in systemic inflammation and associated renal disease. Nod1 activation by bacterial iE-DAP induces maternal-fetal inflammation and preterm labor. The nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognise a wide range of microbial products, as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB).  Nod1 ligands induce site-specific vascular inflammation. The nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognize a wide range of microbial products as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor KB (NFKB), a central regulator of the terminal processes of human labor and delivery.  CONCLUSIONS: We identify NOD proteins as innate immune components that are involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin intolerance.  Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model. In particular, muramyl peptides trigger inflammation, contribute to host defense against microbial infections, and modulate the adaptive immune response to antigens.  Systemic and tissue-specific inflammation was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in NOD ligand-injected mice.  CONCLUSIONS: We identify NOD proteins as innate immune components that are involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin intolerance. Acute activation of NOD proteins by mimetics of bacterial PGNs causes whole-body insulin resistance, bolstering the concept that innate immune responses to distinctive bacterial cues directly lead to insulin resistance.  Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine in intestinal mucosal inflammation, activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein in SW480 cells. These studies suggest that the Th1 cytokine, IFN gamma, activates CARD4/NOD1 transcription and regulate innate immune mechanisms in the condition of intestinal mucosal inflammation. NOD1 activation triggers inflammation, In contrast to enhanced leptin mRNA by LPS and TNFα, NOD1 activation suppressed leptin mRNA in adipocytes, suggesting the differential effects of NOD1 activation in adipocytes.  Overall, our results suggest that NOD1 represents a novel target for adipose inflammation in obesity. NOD1 activation triggers inflammation, antimicrobial mechanisms and autophagy in both epithelial cells and murine macrophages. NOD1 is an intracellular immune receptor that senses peptidoglycan from Gram-negative bacteria and responds by inducing autophagy and activating NF-κB, leading to inflammation-mediated bacterial clearance; however chronic pathogens can evade NOD1-mediated clearance by altering peptidoglycan structure. Bacterial NOD1 activation is positioned as a component of metabolic endotoxemia that can contribute to hyperlipidemia, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance by acting directly on adipocytes. NOD1 ligand also caused inflammation and insulin resistance directly in primary hepatocytes from WT, but not NOD1(-/-), mice. We conclude that NOD1 activation reduced AHR in allergen-induced lung inflammation, which was accompanied by a reduction of allergen-specific T-cell proliferation. The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine in intestinal mucosal inflammation, activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein in SW480 cells."

Isn't K-63 linked protein ubiquitination related to proteasomal degradation?,yes,"In contrast to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains function in nonproteasomal biological processes. Modification of proteins by the addition of lysine (K)-63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains is suggested to play important roles in a variety of cellular events, including DNA repair, signal transduction, and receptor endocytosis.  Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways. Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation. Chains of ubiquitin linked via lysine 48 (K48) are associated with protein degradation while chains linked via lysine 63 (K63) are associated with intracellular signaling. Lys(48)-linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and Lys(63)-linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repair Remarkably, the attached Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are homogeneous and are segregated to separate IP(3)R subunits, and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys-63-linked chains, are required for IP(3)R degradation Activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are modified by homogeneous Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, but only Lys-48-linked chains are required for degradation."

Can chronological age be predicted by measuring telomere length?,no,"Human somatic cells gradually lose telomeric repeats with age. This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual from their DNA. Therefore, telomere length measurement by real-time quantitative PCR cannot be used to predict age of a person, due to the presence of large inter-individual variations in telomere lengths. ur results provide the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a relationship between telomere length and mortality in the wild, and substantiate the prediction that telomere length and shortening rate can act as an indicator of biological age further to chronological age when exploring life history questions in natural conditions."

Is avanafil indicated for treatment of erectile dysfunction?,yes,"CONTEXT: Avanafil (AVA) is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, but is reported for its poor aqueous solubility.  BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil and the recently approved avanafil represent the first-line choice for both on-demand and chronic treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED).  A survey on the experience of 136 Italian urologists in the treatment of erectile dysfunction with PDE5 inhibitors and recommendations for the use of Avanafil in the clinical practice. Efficacy of Avanafil 15 Minutes after Dosing in Men with Erectile Dysfunction: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Study. PURPOSE: We examined the therapeutic effects of avanafil 15 minutes after dosing in men with mild to severe erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil and avanafil are FDA approved drugs in market as PDE5 inhibitors for treating erectile dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Avanafil along with the other PDE5Is has shown to be a safe and effective oral treatment for ED, with avanafil's possible place in therapy for patients who want an on-demand option or as an alternative in patients who experience visual disturbances with the other agents. Avanafil (STENDRA™, SPEDRA™, Zepeeed™) is an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Doesn't HER2 under-expression lead to favorable response to trastuzumab?,yes,"over-expression of HER2 is reported in approximately 20% of gastric tumours, challenging the use of targeted therapies.  In patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer, addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy did not increase the incidence of adverse events. treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer: trastuzumab, Trastuzumab has demonstrated clinical activity in several types of HER2-overexpressing epithelial tumors, such as breast and metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.  An example is the established benefit of trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer; a clear definition of HER2-positivity and the assay reproducibility have, however, remained unanswered.  Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody targeted to the Her2 receptor and approved for treatment of Her2-positive breast cancer. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) is an important target for the treatment of the breast cancers in which it is overexpressed. However, no approved anti-HER2/neu therapy is available for the majority of breast cancer patients, who express HER2/neu at low levels (with scores of 1+ or 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-negative). The humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) is useful in the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers, HercepTestTM (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) is an immunohistochemical assay that detects HER2/neu gene products, and evaluates the overexpression status of the HER2/neu protein in determining eligibility for the Trastuzumab (HerceptinR, Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA) therapy."
Does splicing occur co-transcriptionally?,yes,"Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and mammalian cells - have shown that pre-mRNA can be spliced during the process of transcription (i.e. co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription termination (i.e. post-transcriptionally) The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues. Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs.  The majority of introns in higher eukaryotes are excised prior to transcript release in a manner that is dependent on transcription through pol II s a result of co-transcriptional splicing, variations in pol II elongation influence alternative splicing patterns, wherein a slower elongation rate is associated with increased inclusion of alternative exons within mature mRNA.  We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing Modelling reveals co-transcriptional splicing to be the most probable and most efficient splicing pathway for the reporter transcripts, due in part to a positive feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional second step splicing RNA processing events that take place on the transcribed pre-mRNA include capping, splicing, editing, 3' processing, and polyadenylation. Most of these processes occur co-transcriptionally while the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme is engaged in transcriptional elongation Abundant evidence indicates that splicing to excise introns occurs co-transcriptionally, prior to release of the nascent transcript from RNAP II Together, our work establishes a system for co-transcriptional splicing in vitro, in which the spliceosome containing the 5' and 3' exons are tethered to RNAP II for splicing. Co-transcriptional splicing of constitutive and alternative exons Current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during RNA synthesis Thus, we demonstrate that the decision to include or skip an alternative exon is made during transcription and not post-transcriptionally Here, we demonstrated that the co-transcriptional splicing of the intron in vitro was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the P3-P7 core of the intron RNA editing and alternative splicing: the importance of co-transcriptional coordination Co-transcriptional splicing of pre-messenger RNAs: considerations for the mechanism of alternative splicing The realization that splicing occurs co-transcriptionally requires two important considerations"
Isn't vemurafenib effective for hairy-cell leukemia?,no,"CONCLUSIONS: A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia. Our results strongly support and inform the clinical use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in HCL. The therapeutic approach of vemurafenib in treatment-refractory hairy cell leukemia is promising and offers an additional treatment option.  Successful re-treatment of a relapsed V600E mutated HCL patient with low-dose vemurafenib. Recent identification of the recurrent V600E BRAF mutation in a majority of HCL patients has led some teams to evaluate the clinical potential of vemurafenib, a BRAF V600 specific inhibitor in a limited number of refractory HCL patients. Recently, we published the case of an HCL patient successfully treated with a low dose of vemurafenib. We present here the successful retreatment of this patient with a second line of vemurafenib. Our data suggest for the first time that vemurafenib at the dose of 240 mg once a day could be sufficient to maintain a complete hematological remission after an initial induction treatment with low-dose vemurafenib (2 × 240 mg) daily without inducing major toxicity. The discovery of the BRAF mutation has created a therapeutic target exploited by oral inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib. [Successful use of vemurafenib in a patient with resistant hairy cell leukemia]. The frequent persistence of phosphorylated ERK-positive leukemic cells in bone marrow at the end of treatment suggests bypass reactivation of MEK and ERK as a resistance mechanism.CONCLUSIONS: A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.  A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia. A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia. The therapeutic approach of vemurafenib in treatment-refractory hairy cell leukemia is promising and offers an additional treatment option."
Is the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements disfavored in cancer cells?,no,"Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state."
Is amantadine effective for treatment of disorders conciousness?,yes,"We here provide a systematic overview of the therapeutic effects of amantadine, apomorphine and zolpidem in patients recovering from coma. Evidence from clinical trials using these commonly prescribed pharmacological agents suggests positive changes in the neurological status in patients, leading sometimes to dramatic improvements. Pharmaceuticals that act in the oxygen based amino acid systems of the brain include the GABAergic medications zolpidem and baclofen, while those that act in the monoamine axes include the dopaminergic medications L Dopa, amantadine, bromocriptine, apomorphine and methylphenidate, and the noradrenergic and serotonergic medications desipramine, amitriptyline, protriptyline and fluoxetine.  Sporadic cases of recovery from a DOC have been reported after the administration of various pharmacological agents (baclofen, zolpidem, amantadine etc.). Amantadine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness after traumatic brain injury. Preliminary studies have suggested that amantadine may promote functional recovery.  During the 4-week treatment period, recovery was significantly faster in the amantadine group than in the placebo group, as measured by the DRS score (difference in slope, 0.24 points per week; P=0.007), indicating a benefit with respect to the primary outcome measure.  Amantadine accelerated the pace of functional recovery during active treatment in patients with post-traumatic disorders of consciousness. Sporadic cases of dramatic recovery from DOC after the administration of various pharmacological agents, such as baclofen, zolpidem and amantadine, have been recently supported by intriguing scientific observations.  According to the 16 eligible studies, medical management by dopaminergic agents (levodopa, amantadine), zolpidem and median nerve stimulation, or surgical management by deep brain stimulation, extradural cortical stimulation, spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal baclofen have shown to improve the level of consciousness in certain cases.  Higher exposure of amantadine (average concentration of amantadine during 6 mg/kg/day > 1.5 mg/L) may be associated with better recovery of consciousness.  Based on the preliminary data, higher dosing may be considered in the setting of brain injury. Patients treated with PK-Merz exhibited the more significant restoration of consciousness and better dynamics (regress) of neurological deficit with the most intensive restoration of neurological deficit in the first day that allows to recommend the use of amantadine sulfate in the first hours of ischemic stroke and for the prevention of reperfusion damage in recanalisation therapy of ischemic stroke. There was no significant difference in the slopes of recovery during either arm for the Coma/Near-Coma Scale (P = 0.24) or the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (P = 0.28), although improvements in consciousness were noted by the physician during weeks when amantadine was given (P = 0.02).  This study suggests that amantadine facilitates recovery of consciousness in pediatric acquired brain injury and provides important information necessary to design future more definitive studies. The study has shown a positive effect of this drug at coma emergence, which manifested itself as clinical improvement and a better outcome of the disease. This article will review the evidence for the use of psychostimulants (methylphenidate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buproprion), Parkinson's medications (amantadine, bromocriptine, carbidopa/levodopa), anticonvulsants (valproic acid), modafinil (Provigil), lactate, hyperbaric oxygen chamber, electroconvulsive therapy, and transmagnetic stimulation, in patients following a head injury. Of the psychoactive medications, amantadine hydrochloride was associated with greater recovery and dantrolene sodium was associated with less recovery, in terms of the DRS score at 16 weeks but not the time until commands were followed."
Is oxidative stress affected by FOXO expression?,yes,"Forkhead-box class O (FoxO) transcription factors regulate mechanisms of cellular aging, including protein quality control, autophagy and defenses against oxidative stress. Statin-mediated upregulation of klotho expression and differential regulation of FoxO expression promote resistance to CsA-induced oxidative stress. FoxO expression suppressed the ROS-induced apoptosis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells via the expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Differential expression of FOXO1 and FOXO3a confers resistance to oxidative cell death upon endometrial decidualization. We demonstrate that human endometrial stromal cells become extraordinarily resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis upon decidualization in response to cAMP and progesterone signaling. This differentiation process is associated with the induction of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, which in turn increases the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase. Comparative analysis demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide, a source of free radicals, strongly induces FOXO3a mRNA and protein expression in undifferentiated human endometrial stromal cells but not in decidualized cells. These results suggest that the induction of FOXO1 may enhance the ability of decidualized cells to prevent oxidative damage while the simultaneous repression of FOXO3a expression disables the signaling pathway responsible for oxidative cell death. The differential regulation of FOXO expression provides the decidua with a robust system capable of coping with prolonged episodes of oxidative stress during pregnancy."
Doesn't nimotuzumab improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,no,"The survival times were similar to those seen in historical data of standard therapy. The survival time of a matched population treated at the same hospital with irradiation alone was decreased (median 8.0 and 12.2 mo for GBM and AA patients, respectively) compared with that of the patients who received nimotuzumab and curative-intent radiotherapy. This study, in a poor prognosis population, validates the previous data of survival gain after combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy, in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma patients. The mean and median survival time for subjects treated with nimotuzumab was 31.06 and 17.76 vs. 21.07 and 12.63 months for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial, nimotuzumab showed an excellent safety profile and significant survival benefit in combination with irradiation. Nimotuzumab was well-tolerated and treatment with the antibody yielded a survival benefit: median survival time was 32.66 mo and the 2-y survival rate was 54.2%. This study demonstrated the feasibility of prolonged administration of nimotuzumab and showed preliminary evidence of clinical benefit in HGG patients with poor prognosis.  Recent clinical studies show that patients with malignant gliomas could benefit from nimotuzumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has moderate activity in patients with malignant gliomas and the toxicities are well tolerable, therefore, worth further investigation. It has been evaluated in malignant brain tumors in adults and children, and shown to be therapeutically safe and effective in terms of increased survival and improved quality of life.  Conclusions As used in this study, nimotuzumab demonstrated a broad safety profile, making it acceptable for chronic use, and implied clinical benefits in terms of increased survival and improved functional status in these patients, compared to findings described in the literature.  Nimotuzumab prolongs survival in patients with malignant gliomas: A phase I/II clinical study of concomitant radiochemotherapy with or without nimotuzumab. Conclusions As used in this study, nimotuzumab demonstrated a broad safety profile, making it acceptable for chronic use, and implied clinical benefits in terms of increased survival and improved functional status in these patients, compared to findings described in the literature. This study, in a poor prognosis population, validates the previous data of survival gain after combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy, in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma patients Conclusions As used in this study, nimotuzumab demonstrated a broad safety profile, making it acceptable for chronic use, and implied clinical benefits in terms of increased survival and improved functional status in these patients, compared to findings described in the literature A multicenter exploratory study combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy showed disease control and an overall patient survival similar to previous experiences along with an improvement in the quality of patient survival and no severe side effects. Combining craniospinal irradiation (CSI) with concurrent temozolomide and nimotuzumab therapy may slightly improve tumor control and overall survival"
Aren't cutaneous porphyrias inherited with a recessive pattern?,yes,Five of the porphyrias are low-penetrance autosomal dominant conditions in which clinical expression results from additional factors that act by increasing demand for haem or by causing an additional decrease in enzyme activity or by a combination of these effects Molecular mechanisms of dominant expression in porphyria. Variegate porphyria (VP) is an autosomal-dominant disorder that is caused by inheritance of a partial deficiency of the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4). It is characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity and/or various neurological manifestations.  The acute porphyrias constitute a group of metabolic disorders engaging enzymes in the haem synthetic chain and generally following dominant inheritance patterns.
Isn't there an association between bruxism and reflux?,no,"Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. There was a statistical trend towards tooth wear progression being associated with gastric risk factors (p < 0.05).  This article presents a case report of a 27-year-old male smoker with tooth wear and dentin sensitivity caused by GERD associated with bruxism.  The aim of this cross-over, randomized, single-blinded trial was to examine whether intra-esophageal acidification induces sleep bruxism (SB).  RMMA episodes including SB were induced by esophageal acidification.  Chronic regurgitation of gastric acids in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease may cause dental erosion, which can lead in combination with attrition or bruxism to extensive loss of coronal tooth tissue. This clinical report describes treatment of severe tooth wear of a gastroesophageal reflux disease patient who is 54-year-old Turkish male patient. After his medical treatment, severe tooth wear, bruxism and decreased vertical dimensions were determined.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease by itself or in combination with attrition, abrasion or bruxism may be responsible for the loss. The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes.  The frequencies of RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes were significantly higher during decreased esophageal pH episodes than those during other times.  These results suggest that most jaw muscle activities, ie, RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes, occur in relation to gastroesophageal reflux mainly in the supine position. Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing."
Don't Parkinson's disease patients experience stridor?,no,"The authors describe a patient experiencing stridor and dysphagia with confirmed pulmonary restriction and aspiration following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulator adjustment, with a resolution of symptoms and signs when the stimulator was switched off. Stridor was not noted during sleep at night. Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration.  The stridor was specific to MSA.  Patients with MSA can present other clinical features, such as inspiratory stridor and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). We report a patient with pathologically confirmed MSA who presented with a longstanding history of stridor, RBD and autonomic disturbances but did not develop overt parkinsonism or cerebellar signs. This case illustrates that MSA may present clinically without its cardinal motor symptoms, and that stridor and RBD may be clues to recognise the disease in a patient with autonomic failure. Patients with PD did not display sleep hypoventilation, stridor and abnormal central sleep apnea.  DEVELOPMENT: Autonomic disorders such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and disorders involving sweating, fatigue, weight loss or respiratory problems (dyspnea, inspiratory stridor) are highly prevalent and very disabling symptoms. In addition, they may be the main problem in a particular phase of PD (fatigue, stridor) and condition the quality of life of patients with Parkinson.  . Her dyspneic attacks consisting of inspiratory stridor and cyanosis occurred mainly during the wearing-off time and continued for less than 30 min The most commonly reported sleep disorders were sleep fragmentation (52.5%), vocalisation (60%), REM sleep behaviour disorder (47.5%), and nocturnal stridor (19%). Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD Six days after admission, dyspnea and inspiratory stridor were noted, and the respiratory distress worsened.  A patient is described with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe laryngeal stridor. The laryngeal stridor responded to levodopa therapy, and we are not aware that this has been reported previously. The subsequent clinical course of the former eight patients has been typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, whilst the ninth patient has developed postural hypotension, urinary incontinence and respiratory stridor typical of multiple system atrophy.  Although each of five autonomic domains was affected in variable numbers of IPD patients, AD in MSA generally involved more autonomic domains than in IPD, and to a more severe degree, in particular with regard to inspiratory stridor. However, the presence of severe AD, of AD preceding parkinsonism, or of inspiratory stridor, are all individually suggestive of MSA. Apart from dysautonomia, the principal discriminant clinical features that distinguished SND from PD were the early appearance of the following symptoms and signs: (a) severe and atypical progressive parkinsonism characterized by bilateral bradykinesia and rigidity, slowness of gait, postural instability, and falls, and poor or absent response to adequate levodopa treatment; (b) increased tendon reflexes associated or not with frank pyramidal signs, severe dysarthria, and less consistently, dysphagia, stridor, antecollis, and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, which, when present, are highly suggestive of the disease. OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We report a 73-year-old Parkinson's disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions.  RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients were identified.  This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management. RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients were identified. This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients, as this affects management. OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinsons disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinsons disease.

Are DNA methylation maps applicable to the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung carcinomas?,yes,"Here we present a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of NSCLC samples and paired lung tissues, where we combine MethylCap and next generation sequencing (MethylCap-seq) to provide comprehensive DNA methylation maps of the tumor and paired lung samples. Analysis of the MethylCap-seq data revealed a strong positive correlation between replicate experiments and between paired tumor/lung samples. We identified 57 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) present in all NSCLC tumors analyzed by MethylCap-seq. While hypomethylated DMRs did not correlate to any particular functional category of genes, the hypermethylated DMRs were strongly associated with genes encoding transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions and satellite repeats were hypomethylated in the NSCLC samples. We also identified DMRs that were specific to two of the major subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Collectively, we provide a resource containing genome-wide DNA methylation maps of NSCLC and their paired lung tissues, and comprehensive lists of known and novel DMRs and associated genes in NSCLC. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of non-small cell lung carcinomas. Genomewide DNA methylation analysis identifies novel methylated genes in non-small-cell lung carcinomas. To identify candidate markers for use in NSCLC diagnosis, we used genomewide DNA methylation maps that we had previously generated by MethylCap and next-generation sequencing and listed the most significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The 25 DMRs with highest significance in their methylation scores were selected. The methylation status of these DMRs was investigated in 61 tumors and matching control lung tissues by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We found 12 novel DMRs that showed significant differences between tumor and control lung tissues. We also identified three novel DMRs for each of the two most common NSCLC subtypes, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. We propose a panel of five DMRs, composed of novel and known markers that exhibit high specificity and sensitivity to distinguish tumors from control lung tissues. Here we present a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of NSCLC samples and paired lung tissues, where we combine MethylCap and next generation sequencing (MethylCap-seq) to provide comprehensive DNA methylation maps of the tumor and paired lung samples. It is a very stable and specific modification and therefore in principle a very suitable marker for epigenetic phenotyping of tumors. Here we present a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of NSCLC samples and paired lung tissues, where we combine MethylCap and next generation sequencing (MethylCap-seq) to provide comprehensive DNA methylation maps of the tumor and paired lung samples. Here we present a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of NSCLC samples and paired lung tissues, where we combine MethylCap and next generation sequencing (MethylCap-seq) to provide comprehensive DNA methylation maps of the tumor and paired lung samples.

Are ultraconserved elements depleted among copy number variants (CNVs)?,yes,"We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. Here, we report that nonexonic UCEs are also depleted among 10 of 11 recent genomewide data sets of human CNVs, including 3 obtained with strategies permitting greater precision in determining the extents of CNVs Interestingly, human UCEs have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs) We propose that these elements may be interpreted as hallmarks for dose-sensitive genes, particularly for those genes whose gain or loss may be directly implied in neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, their presence in genomic imbalances of unknown effect might be suggestive of a clinically relevant condition Mammalian ultraconserved elements are strongly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are strongly depleted from segmental duplications and copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome, suggesting that deletion or duplication of a UCE can be deleterious to the mammalian cell. Interestingly, human UCEs have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs). We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison.

Does the majority of the mitochondrial genomes abide to the second parity rule (PR2)?,no,"a large number of mitochondrial genomes significantly deviate from the 2nd parity rule in contrast to the eubacterial ones mitochondria may be divided into three distinct sub-groups according to their overall deviation from the aforementioned parity rule. The behaviour of the large majority of the mitochondrial genomes may be attributed to their distinct mode of replication, which is fundamentally different from the one of the eubacteria. We tested all available organellar genomes and found that a large number of mitochondrial genomes significantly deviate from the 2nd parity rule in contrast to the eubacterial ones, although mitochondria are believed to have evolved from proteobacteria.

Do selenoproteins and selenium play a role in prostate cancer prevention?,no,"The selenoprotein-deficient mice exhibited accelerated development of lesions associated with prostate cancer progression, implicating selenoproteins in cancer risk and development and raising the possibility that selenium prevents cancer by modulating the levels of these selenoproteins Notably and in contrast to previous studies, RWPE-1 cells were significantly more sensitive to selenite than either of the prostate cancer cell lines. These results demonstrate that selenoproteins and selenium metabolism are regulated at multiple levels in prostate cells In a low-selenium population, SOD2-Ala16+ men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 are at an increased risk of prostate cancer/aggressive prostate cancer especially if ever-smokers, because they are likely to produce more mitochondrial H(2)O(2) that they cannot remove, thereby promoting prostate tumor cell proliferation and migration. Our results support a role of selenium and polymorphisms in selenoenzymes in prostate cancer etiology, which warrants confirmation in future studies. This study provides evidence that SEP15 genetic variation may influence PCa mortality. Additionally, the association of selenium with PCa mortality was modified by a variant, suggesting the possibility that some men with PCa may benefit more from selenium than others, depending on their genotype. We conclude that decreased SEPP concentration in serum might represent an additional valuable marker for prostate cancer diagnostics. The recently completed Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) was one of the largest human cancer prevention trials ever undertaken. Its purpose was to assess the role of selenium and vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention, but SELECT found no decline in prostate cancer. We studied Se levels in whole blood, plasma and prostate of 32 PC and 40 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients and in the control group composed of 39 healthy subjects. The selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was also measured in the patients' red cells, plasma and prostate tissue. Se concentration in whole blood and plasma in both groups of patients was lower as compared with controls, while in prostate gland it was significantly higher in PC than in BPH patients and controls. Red cell GSH-Px activity was the same in PC patients and controls but significantly lower in BPH patients. Of particular interest was the positive correlation between tissue GPx activity and Gleason score, with this relationship achieving statistical significance among African-Americans (r = 0.67, P = 0.02)"
Can acupuncture cause spinal epidural hematoma?,yes,"RESULTS: A 54-year-old woman, a 38-year-old woman, and a 60-year-old man with hemiplegia by cervical subdural or epidural hematoma after cervical posterior paraspinal muscle needling without direct invasion (intramuscular stimulation, acupuncture, or intramuscular lidocaine) were observed. Acute spinal subdural hematoma with hemiplegia after acupuncture: a case report and review of the literature. Although acupuncture has been a popular method for the management of pain control, we encountered the first case of SDH after acupuncture.PURPOSE: The purpose of this case report was to present the first case of subdural hematoma after acupuncture and the reasons for the risks of blind cervical acupuncture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidural hematomas after dry needling are quite unusual and only a few cases of epidural hematoma after acupuncture have been reported in the literature. Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc.  Unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal produced a spinal epidural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Can't Levoxyl (levothyroxine sodium) cause insomnia?,no,"METHODS: Seventy-one patients diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism were randomly allocated into two study groups: the first group received usual dose of levothyroxine and the second group received combination of levothyroxine and liothyronine for at least 4 months. The main outcomes were psychosocial problems (Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire, GHQ-28), bodyweight, heart rate, blood pressure, and serum lipid levels. RESULTS: In both groups serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels remained unchanged compared with baseline. Psychosocial scores, body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and lipid profile in the two groups remained constant. The only exception was a small but significant reduction in anxiety/insomnia in combined treatment group as compared with monotherapy."
Is synapsin a phosphoprotein?,yes,Synapsin is an evolutionarily conserved presynaptic phosphoprotein.

Could plasmepsins be used as targets for developing anti-malaria drugs?,yes,"Fighting malaria: structure-guided discovery of nonpeptidomimetic plasmepsin inhibitors. Given that the parasite needs the resulting amino acid building blocks for its growth and development, plasmepsins are an important antimalarial drug target.  Due to early crystallographic evidence, plasmepsin II (Plm II) emerged as well explored target to develop novel antimalarials as well as a starting point to develop inhibitors targeting some other subtypes of plasmepsins i.e. Plm I, II, IV and V. With the advancements in drug discovery, several computational and synthetic approaches were employed in order to develop novel inhibitors targeting Plm II.  Structural basis for plasmepsin V inhibition that blocks export of malaria proteins to human erythrocytes. Plasmepsin V, an essential aspartyl protease of malaria parasites, has a key role in the export of effector proteins to parasite-infected erythrocytes. Consequently, it is an important drug target for the two most virulent malaria parasites of humans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Plasmepsin V (PmV) is an essential Plasmodium protease and a highly promising antimalarial target, which still lacks molecular characterization and drug-like inhibitors. Our inhibitors act 'on-target', confirmed by cellular interference of PmV function and biochemical interaction with inhibitors.  Our work disclosed novel pursuable drug design strategies for highly efficient PmV inhibition highlighting novel molecular elements necessary for picomolar activity against PmV. All the presented data are discussed in respect to human aspartic proteases and previously reported inhibitors, highlighting differences and proposing new strategies for drug development. High binding likeness on antimalarial target plasmepsin was detected through molecular docking.  This provides the first direct evidence that PMV activity is essential for protein export in Plasmodium spp. and for parasite survival in human erythrocytes and validates PMV as an antimalarial drug target. The export mechanism involves the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL), which is a cleavage site for the parasite protease, Plasmepsin V (PMV).  Plasmepsin II (PM II) is an attractive target for anti-malaria drug discovery, which involves in host hemoglobin degradation in the acidic food vacuole. These methods are utilized to search for inhibitors of the aspartyl proteases, plasmepsin II and cathepsin D. Plasmepsin II, a protease found in the malaria parasite, hydrolyzes human hemoglobin, the nutrient source for the parasite and is a new target for anti-malaria therapy. Given recent advances in understanding the fundamental roles of the various plasmepsins, it is likely that the most effective antimalarial plasmepsin targets will be the non-digestive vacuole plasmepsins. Plasmepsins (PMs) are essential proteases of the plasmodia parasites and are therefore promising targets for developing drugs against malaria. Therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets. As inhibition of plasmepsins leads to the parasite's death, these enzymes can be utilized as potential drug targets. falciparum plasmepsins II and IV make structure-based drug design of antimalarial compounds that focus on inhibiting plasmepsins possible. The malarial parasite encodes two homologous aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, which are essential components of its hemoglobin-degradation pathway and are novel targets for antimalarial drug development. vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies. In P.falciparum, plasmepsins I, II, IV and HAP have been directly implicated in hemoglobin degradation during malaria infection, and are now considered targets for anti-malarial drug design. These results shed light on the role of V105 and T108 residues in plasmepsin specificities, and they should be useful in structure-based design of novel, selective inhibitors that may serve as antimalarial drugs. The aspartic proteases plasmepsins, whose inhibition leads to parasite death, are classified as targets for the design of potent drugs. A large compound library of about 1 million chemical compounds was docked on 5 different targets of plasmepsins using two different docking software, namely FlexX and AutoDock. Plasmodium aspartic proteases known as plasmepsins play an important role on haemoglobin degradation and are being studied as drug targets for chemotherapy of malaria. Our study revealed about 100 parasite-coded gene products that included many known drug targets such as Pf hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, Pf L-lactate dehydrogenase, and Plasmepsins. The two aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, from Plasmodium falciparum have recently emerged as potential targets. Plasmepsins are highly promising as drug targets, especially when combined with the inhibition of falcipains that are also involved in hemoglobin catabolism. Among such enzymes, Plasmepsins (aspartic proteases) and, especially, Falcipains (cysteine proteases) are highly promising antimalarial drug targets. The high sequence conservations between the plasmepsins from the isolates support the notion that the enzymes could be reliable targets for new antimalarial chemotherapeutics. Due to early crystallographic evidence, plasmepsin II (Plm II) emerged as well explored target to develop novel antimalarials as well as a starting point to develop inhibitors targeting some other subtypes of plasmepsins i.e. Plasmepsin, an aspartic protease, which is involved in the hemoglobin breakdown into smaller peptides emerged as a crucial target to develop new chemical entities to counter malaria. were employed in order to develop new chemical entities targeting Plm II. With the advancements in drug discovery, several computational and synthetic approaches were employed in order to develop novel inhibitors targeting Plm II. vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies.. We developed a potent inhibitor of plasmepsin V, called WEHI-842, which directly mimics the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL). In order to validate appropriate use of PM4 as potential anti-malarial drug target, studies on genetic and structural variations among P. Over the past decade, much effort has been placed towards developing plasmepsin inhibitors as antimalarial agents, particularly targeting the digestive vacuole."
Does ziconotide bind to N-type calcium channels?,yes,"Since this region partially overlaps with residues previously implicated in block of the channel by omega-conotoxin GVIA, we assessed the effects of mutations in the putative EF hand domain on channel block by omega-conotoxin GVIA and the structurally related omega-conotoxin MVIIA. Both of the toxins irreversibly block the activity of wild type alpha(1B) N-type channels.  Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively.   Binding assay for both N- and P/Q-type calcium channels showed that amino acid residues restricted to the N-terminal half are important for the recognition of N-type channels, whereas essential residues for P/Q-type channel recognition are widely spread over the whole omega-conotoxin molecule. Ziconotide is a novel peptide that blocks the entry of calcium into neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, preventing the conduction of nerve signals. Ziconotide is a selective, potent and reversible blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). The therapeutic benefit of ziconotide derives from its potent and selective blockade of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Interactions of intrathecally administered ziconotide, a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, with morphine on nociception in rats. Ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, administered intrathecally for acute postoperative pain. Ziconotide, an intrathecally administered N-type calcium channel antagonist for the treatment of chronic pain. Thus, ziconotide is the first of a new class of agents--N-type calcium channel blockers, or NCCBs. Ziconotide, formerly known also as SNX- 111, represents a new class of agents, the N-type calcium channel blockers. The selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide ameliorates severe chronic pain but has a narrow therapeutic window and requires intrathecal administration. A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain. As the clinically available analgesics, pregabalin (alpha2delta-subunit calcium channel ligand), ziconotide (N-type calcium channel blocker), mexiletine (sodium channel blocker), and duloxetine (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) were evaluated in these neurochemically-induced allodynia models. The present investigation was designed to assess the safety and analgesic efficacy of ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, when administered intrathecally to patients with acute postoperative pain. Inhibition of the N-type calcium channel by intrathecal administration of the channel-specific blocker omega-conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide) is efficacious in the treatment of severe chronic pain. Ziconotide is a powerful analgesic drug that has a unique mechanism of action involving potent and selective block of N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmission at many synapses. In conclusion, present findings provide implication that the spinal anti-nociceptive mechanistic site of pregabalin is different from that of ziconotide, mexiletine, and duloxetine, and pregabalin could have a broader anti-nociceptive mechanism other than N-type calcium channel blockade. Ziconotide (SNX-111), a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, is antinociceptive when it is administered intrathecally. Effects of intrathecal administration of ziconotide, a selective neuronal N-type calcium channel blocker, on mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia in a rat model of postoperative pain. A state-dependent Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor may provide an improved therapeutic window over ziconotide, the peptidyl Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor used clinically.  There is also human validation data from ziconotide, the CaV2.2-selective peptidyl inhibitor used clinically to treat refractory pain.  A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain.  The neuroprotective effects of intrathecal administration of the selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide in a rat model of spinal ischemia."
Are microRNA (miR) regulated through DNA methylation of their promoters?,yes,"We found that Tcf3 down-regulation in the context of constitutively active Wnt signaling does not result from promoter DNA methylation but is likely to be caused by a plethora of mechanisms at both the RNA and protein level as shown by the observed decrease in activating histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3-acetylation) and the upregulation of miR-211, a novel Wnt-regulated microRNA that targets Tcf3 and attenuates early neural differentiation in mouse ESCs ene silencing of MIR22 in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia involves histone modifications independent of promoter DNA methylation Whereas a CpG island was identified within the promoter element of MIR22, no promoter DNA methylation was detected in these cells xtensive promoter DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation is associated with aberrant microRNA expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia Integration of DNA methylation and miRNA promoter data led to the identification of 128 recurrent miRNA targets for aberrant promoter DNA methylation Together, our findings characterize the role of epigenetic changes in the regulation of miRNA transcription and create a repository of disease-specific promoter regions that may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of CLL NA methylation of microRNA genes in multiple myeloma Recently, epigenetic dysregulation of tumor-suppressor miRNA genes by promoter DNA methylation has been implicated in human cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM) ethylation of tumor suppressor microRNAs Dysregulation of miRNA expression involved in cancer can be triggered by multiple mechanisms including aberrant DNA methylation of the miRNA gene promoter Of note, DNA methylation of tumor suppressor miRNAs has been implicated in various human cancers Moreover, miRNA silencing mediated by aberrant promoter DNA methylation can potentially be reversed by hypomethylating agents, and hence may pose a new therapeutic target in cancer  In this review, the authors will focus on the aberrant methylation of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia Here, we review those miRNAs implicated in AD that are regulated by promoter DNA methylation and/or chromatin modifications and, which frequently direct the expression of constituents of the epigenetic machinery, concluding with the delineation of a complex epigenetic-miRNA regulatory network and its alterations in AD Furthermore, we also discuss epigenetic dysregulation of tumor-suppressor miRNA genes by promoter DNA methylation and the interaction of DNA methylation with miRNAs involved in the regulation of HSC activation and liver fibrosi Instead, the cell type-specific silencing of these genes is due to enhanced p21 mRNA degradation, 14-3-3sigma promoter DNA methylation and reduced processing of the miR-34a primary transcript Some tumor-suppressive miRNAs are known to be epigenetically silenced by promoter DNA methylation in cancer In the present study, we aimed to identify miRNA genes that are silenced by DNA hypermethylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) It was found that miR-335, which is harbored within an intron of its protein-coding host gene, MEST, was downregulated by aberrant promoter hypermethylation via further methylation assays, including methylation-specific PCR, combined bisulfite and restriction analysis, bisulfite sequencing analysis and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment he levels of miR-335/MEST methylation were significantly higher in 18 (90%) out of 20 primary HCC tumors, compared to their non-tumor tissue counterparts (P<0.001) In conclusion, our results indicate that expression of miR-335 is reduced by aberrant DNA methylation in HCC."
Doesn't SARM1 deletion cause neurodegeneration?,yes,"Finally, using neurons from two distinct mutant mouse strains whose axons are highly resistant to neurodegeneration (Wld(S) and Sarm1(-/-)), we found that the three different fibrils were secreted by axons after anterograde transport, in the absence of axonal lysis, indicating that trans-neuronal spread can occur in intact healthy neurons."
Isn't tubulin acetylation involved in cell motility?,no,"In this study, we found that paclitaxel induced tubulin acetylation in endothelial and tumor cells, at concentrations that affected cell motility but not proliferation (10(-8) to 10(-9) M, for 4 hours). Induction of tubulin acetylation correlated with inhibition of motility but not proliferation based on a comparison of highly and poorly cytotoxic taxanes (paclitaxel and IDN5390) and tumor cell lines sensitive and resistant to paclitaxel (1A9 and 1A9 PTX22). we found that overexpression of the tubulin deacetylase SIRT2 increased cell motility and reduced cell response to the anti-motility activity of paclitaxel. Conversely, the SIRT2 inhibitor splitomicin reduced cell motility and potentiated the anti-motility activity of paclitaxel. The inhibitory effect was further potentiated by the addition of the HDAC6 inhibitor trichostatin A. Cell motility and adhesion involves dynamic microtubule (MT) acetylation/deacetylation, a process regulated by enzymes as HDAC6, a major cytoplasmic α-tubulin deacetylase. GRK2 and HDAC6 colocalize in the lamellipodia of migrating cells, leading to local tubulin deacetylation and enhanced motility. This review highlights the emerging roles of tubulin acetylation in multiple cellular functions, ranging from cell motility, cell cycle progression or cell differentiation to intracellular trafficking and signalling. Our results indicate that TPPP/p25 binds to HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6), an enzyme responsible for tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the direct interaction of these two proteins resulted in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. Finally, we demonstrated that, similarly to other HDAC6 inhibitors, TPPP/p25 influences the microtubule dynamics by decreasing the growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and also affects cell motility as demonstrated by time lapse video experiments. ""tubacin,"" which inhibits alpha-tubulin deacetylation in mammalian cells. We provide evidence that class II histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is the intracellular target of tubacin. Tubacin treatment did not affect the stability of microtubules but did decrease cell motility. They also suggest that small molecules that selectively inhibit HDAC6-mediated alpha-tubulin deacetylation, a first example of which is tubacin, might have therapeutic applications as antimetastatic and antiangiogenic agents. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 promotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. HDAC6 is a major cytoplasmic a-tubulin deacetylase that is involved in cell motility and adhesion. GRK2 dynamically and directly associates with and phosphorylates HDAC6 to stimulate its a-tubulin deacetylase activity at specific cellular localizations, such as the leading edge of migrating cells, thus promoting local tubulin deacetylation and enhanced motility."

Don't do U6-associated proteins Lsm4 and Lsm6 interact with SMN?,no,"SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6.  Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6 Furthermore, we present evidence for two separate binding sites in SMN for Sm/Lsm proteins. Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6.  Symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues in spliceosomal Sm protein B/B' and the Sm-like protein LSm4, and their interaction with the SMN protein. Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domain of Lsm4 directly interacts with SMN. This entity promotes the binding of a set of factors, termed LSm/Sm proteins, onto snRNA to form the core structure of these particles.  Toward an assembly line for U7 snRNPs: interactions of U7-specific Lsm proteins with PRMT5 and SMN complexes. In this report, we demonstrate that the coilin C-terminal domain binds directly to various Sm and Lsm proteins via their Sm motifs. We show that the region of coilin responsible for this binding activity is separable from that which binds to SMN. Thus, the ability to interact with free Sm (and Lsm) proteins as well as with intact snRNPs, indicates that coilin and CBs may facilitate the modification of newly formed snRNPs, the regeneration of 'mature' snRNPs, or the reclamation of unassembled snRNP components. Moreover this structure has important consequences for snRNP assembly that is mediated by two complexes containing the PRMT5 methyltransferase and the SMN (survival of motor neurons) protein, respectively. Arginine/glycine (RG)-rich domains in components of the SMN complex interact with Sm, like-Sm (LSm), fibrillarin, RNA helicase A (Gu), and coilin proteins, all of which are antigen targets in a variety of diseases."

disease ibd they are characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract significantly impacting on patient quality of life and often requiring prolonged treatment existing therapies for ibd are not effective for all patients and an unmet need exists for additional therapies to induce and maintain remission here we describe the mechanism of action of the janus kinase jak inhibitor tofacitinib for the treatment of ibd and the effect of jak inhibition on the chronic cycle of inflammation that is characteristic of the disease the pathogenesis of ibd involves a dysfunctional response from the innate and adaptive immune system resulting in overexpression of multiple inflammatory cytokines many of which signal through jaks thus jak inhibition allows multiple cytokine signaling pathways to be targeted and is expected to modulate the innate and adaptive immune response in ibd thereby interrupting the cycle of inflammation tofacitinib is an oral small molecule jak inhibitor that is being investigated as a targeted immunomodulator for ibd clinical development of tofacitinib and other jak inhibitors is ongoing with the aspiration of providing new treatment options for ibd that have the potential to deliver prolonged efficacy and clinically meaningful patient benefits."
Isn't progesterone effective for treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury based on clinical trial data?,yes,"BACKGROUND: Progesterone has been associated with robust positive effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and with clinical benefits in two phase 2 randomized, controlled trials.  The proportion of patients with a favorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (good recovery or moderate disability) was 50.4% with progesterone, as compared with 50.5% with placebo. Mortality was similar in the two groups. No relevant safety differences were noted between progesterone and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary efficacy analyses showed no clinical benefit of progesterone in patients with severe TBI. These data stand in contrast to the robust preclinical data and results of early single-center trials that provided the impetus to initiate phase 3 trials. BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Progesterone has been shown to improve neurologic outcome in multiple experimental models and two early-phase trials involving patients with TBI.  There was no significant difference between the progesterone group and the placebo group in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (relative benefit of progesterone, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.06; P=0.35). Phlebitis or thrombophlebitis was more frequent in the progesterone group than in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.03; CI, 1.96 to 4.66).  CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not show a benefit of progesterone over placebo in the improvement of outcomes in patients with acute TBI.  Numerous studies, however, show that progesterone has substantial pleiotropic properties as a neuroprotective agent in both animal models and humans. RESULTS: There was a better recovery rate and GOS score for the patients who were given progesterone than for those in the control group in a 3-months follow-up period (50% vs. 21%); subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the percentage of favorable outcome between the two groups with GCS of 5-8 (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of progesterone may significantly improve neurologic outcome of patients suffering severe TBI up to 3 months after injury, especially those with 5≤GCS≤8, providing a potential benefit to the treatment of acute severe TBI patients. Considering this drug had no significant side effects, so progesterone could be used in patients with severe TBI as a neuro-protective drug. While progesterone and ciclosporin have shown promise in phase II studies, success in larger phase III, randomized, multicentre, clinical trials is pending.  All three studies reported the effects of progesterone on mortality. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up was 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone to be 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. GOS was classified to 2 main categories of favorable and unfavorable recovery, of which, favorable recovery in placebo, progesterone, and progesterone-vitamin D was 25%, 45%, and 60%, respectively which showed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P-value = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The results showed that recovery rate in patients with severe brain trauma in the group receiving progesterone and vitamin D together was significantly higher than that of progesterone group, which was in turn higher than that of placebo group.  The pooled relative risk (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up is 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone was 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.96. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury.  Improved outcomes from the administration of progesterone for patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  The modified Functional Independence Measure scores in the progesterone group were higher than those in the placebo group at both 3-month and 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). The mortality rate of the progesterone group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  These data, combined with the results of the previously published ProTECT trial, show progesterone to be safe and potentially efficacious in the treatment of TBI. Larger phase III trials will be necessary to verify results prior to clinical implementation. CONCLUSION: It indicated that successive early application of PG will benefit the patients with acute severe head injury by improving the recovery and reducing the disability, which may be related to its alleviating inflammatory and lipid peroxidation response. Adverse and serious adverse event rates were similar in both groups, except that patients randomized to progesterone had a lower 30-day mortality rate than controls (rate ratio 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.99).  However, moderate traumatic brain injury survivors who received progesterone were more likely to have a moderate to good outcome than those randomized to placebo. CONCLUSION: In this small study, progesterone caused no discernible harm and showed possible signs of benefit. After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries. After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries A US National Institutes of Health-sponsored, nationwide Phase III clinical trial is now evaluating progesterone for moderate-to-severe TBI in 1200 patients An industry-sponsored Phase III international trial is also under way, and planning for a trial using progesterone to treat pediatric brain injury has begun More than two decades of pre-clinical research and two recent clinical trials have shown that progesterone (PROG) and its metabolites exert beneficial effects after traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a number of metabolic and physiological pathways that can reduce damage in many different tissues and organ systems After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries RESULTS: Analysis of these reviews yielded meanfuling observations: (1) The effectiveness of most ordinary treatments in TBI is inconclusive except that corticosteroids are likely to be ineffective or harmful, and tranexamic acid, nimodipine and progesterone show a promising effect in bleeding trauma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, TBI or severe TBI. Laboratory data strongly show that progesterone treatment after TBI reduces edema, improves outcomes, and restores blood-brain barrier function. Clinical studies to date agree with these data, and there are ongoing human trials for progesterone treatment after TBI."
Aren't there any specific antidotes for rivaroxaban?,yes,"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)--apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban--have a significantly smaller risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs. he new oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis) have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and are alternatives to warfarin. However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect.  Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications;  Like any new therapy, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential challenges and one of the most concerning aspects of the new target-specific oral anticoagulants is the lack of a proven method to reverse their effect. Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes. NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication. But they have disadvantages also, they depend on renal clearance, they can interact with other medicaments and they lack a specific antidote.  While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in ""real-life"" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. Rivaroxaban, which inhibits activated factor X (Xa), is currently in clinical trials and is the most advanced factor Xa inhibitor. The drug offers once-daily oral dosing, with no need for injections, dose titration, or frequent blood tests to monitor the international normalised ratio. It has a rapid onset of action and, although there is no specific antidote, it has a short plasma elimination half-life (about 5-9 hours).  Increased use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban as oral anticoagulants for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and acute deep venous thrombosis has increased despite the lack of known antidotes to these medications. There is no antidote for reversal and no reliable laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect for emergency situations.  Further concerns about the use of NOAC in the elderly are the high prevalence of renal insufficiency in AF patients >75 years of age, the largely unknown risk of drug-drug and drug-food interactions, the lack of easily available laboratory monitoring tests of anticoagulant activity and the lack of an antidote. Specific antidotes for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies against the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran or recombinant Xa-analog in the case of factor Xa inhibitors, are still being investigated in early clinical trials. In early 2013 there is no antidote for dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban, nor any specific treatment with proven efficacy for severe bleeding linked to these drugs."
Isn't there any role of TBR1 in autism?,no,"TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex Exome sequencing studies have identified multiple genes harboring de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including TBR1, a master regulator of cortical development. We performed ChIP-seq for TBR1 during mouse cortical neurogenesis and show that TBR1-bound regions are enriched adjacent to ASD genes. ASD genes were also enriched among genes that are differentially expressed in Tbr1 knockouts, which together with the ChIP-seq data, suggests direct transcriptional regulation. Of the nine ASD genes examined, seven were misexpressed in the cortices of Tbr1 knockout mice, including six with increased expression in the deep cortical layers. ASD genes with adjacent cortical TBR1 ChIP-seq peaks also showed unusually low levels of LoF mutations in a reference human population and among Icelanders. We then leveraged TBR1 binding to identify an appealing subset of candidate ASD genes. Our findings highlight a TBR1-regulated network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations, indicating that these genes may play critical roles in normal cortical development. T-Brain-1--A Potential Master Regulator in Autism Spectrum Disorders. T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. The downstream genes of TBR1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses. In this study, we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches. Of 124 TBR1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with ASDs. Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. A further five of the 24 genes (Cd44, Cdh8, Cntn6, Gpc6, and Ntng1) encode membrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth. These genes likely contribute to the role of TBR1 in regulation of neuronal migration and axonal extension. Besides, decreases in Grin2b expression and increases in Gad1 expression imply that neuronal activity may be aberrant in Tbr1 deficient mice. These analyses provide direction for future experiments to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of autism. The activity-regulated gene expression of transcription factors is required for neural plasticity and function in response to neuronal stimulation. T-brain-1 (TBR1), a critical neuron-specific transcription factor for forebrain development, has been recognized as a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorders.  Disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been repeatedly identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  Next-generation sequencing recently revealed that recurrent disruptive mutations in a few genes may account for 1% of sporadic autism cases. Coupling these novel genetic data to empirical assays of protein function can illuminate crucial molecular networks. Here we demonstrate the power of the approach, performing the first functional analyses of TBR1 variants identified in sporadic autism. T-brain-1 (TBR1) is a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. In 1995, Tbr1 was first identified from a subtractive hybridization that compared mouse embryonic and adult telencephalons. Previous studies of Tbr1 (-∕-) mice have indicated critical roles for TBR1 in the development of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. Neuronal migration and axonal projection are two important developmental features controlled by TBR1. Recently, recurrent de novo disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been found in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Human genetic studies have identified TBR1 as a high-confidence risk factor for ASDs. TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex. De novo TBR1 mutations in sporadic autism disrupt protein functions. In humans, PAX6, EOMES, and TBR1 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. Neuronal excitation upregulates Tbr1, a high-confidence risk gene of autism, mediating Grin2b expression in the adult brain.

Isn't vemurafenib used for thyroid cancer?,no,"Vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive metastatic or unresectable papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine: a non-randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial. Vemurafenib, an oncogenic BRAF kinase inhibitor approved for BRAF-positive melanoma, showed clinical benefit in three patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer in a phase 1 trial. INTERPRETATION: Vemurafenib showed antitumour activity in patients with progressive, BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine who had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor.

CONCLUSIONS: Vemurafenib is a potentially effective and well-tolerated treatment strategy in patients with advanced PTC harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have demonstrated superior efficacy in patients with BRAF-mutant melanomas but have limited efficacy in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.

Aren't selenium supplements recommended for prostate cancer prevention?,yes,"Our meta-analysis in prospective studies demonstrated a significant inverse association between selenium status and CVD risk within a narrow selenium range and a null effect of selenium supplementation on CVD was observed in RCTs. These findings indicate the importance of considering selenium status, dose and safety in health assessment and future study design. Selenium supplementation of 140 or more μg/day after diagnosis of nonmetastatic prostate cancer may increase risk of prostate cancer mortality. Caution is warranted regarding usage of such supplements among men with prostate cancer. The SELECT study failed to show any significant risk reduction for prostate cancers ascribable to selenium and vitamin E supplementations. Vitamins and supplements, including selenium or vitamin E, have not been proven in clinical trials to prevent prostate cancer and in the case of Vitamin E has been found to increase the risk of incident prostate cancer. Ongoing and future trials may further elucidate the role of diet and immunotherapy for prevention of prostate cancer."

Is statin use associated with improved outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?,yes,"Statins have been shown in two recent small phase I/II trials to be associated with a marked reduction in clinical and transcranial Doppler (TCD) evidence of vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).  Statins did not result in reduced TCD velocities, clinical or angiographic vasospasm, or improvements in global outcome at the time of hospital discharge.  There remains significant uncertainty as to the role of statins in preventing vasospasm after SAH. Although the results of 2 randomized clinical trials demonstrated that statin decreases the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after aSAH, retrospective studies have failed to confirm this. There were no differences in the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (25.3 vs 30.5%; p = 0.277), in-hospital mortality rate (18 vs 15%; p = 0.468), length of hospitalization (21 +/- 15 vs 19 +/- 12 days; p = 0.281), or poor outcome at discharge (Glasgow Outcome Scale Scores 1-2: 21.7 vs 18.2%; p = 0.416) between the simvastatin and nonstatin cohorts.  The uniform introduction of simvastatin did not reduce the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, death, or poor outcome in patients with aSAH. Simvastatin was well tolerated, but its benefit may be less than has been previously reported. Cholesterol-reducing agents might improve unfavourable outcomes. We cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of lowering cholesterol in aneurysmal SAH because of insufficient reliable evidence from only one small trial. Experimental evidence has indicated the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There was an improvement in the functional outcome in the simvastatin group at 1, 3 or 6 months in the follow-up; however, this difference was not statistically significant.  There was benefit of simvastatin in terms of reduction in clinical vasospasm, mortality or improved functional outcome, however, this was not statistically significant. Cerebral vasomotor reactivity, however, is significantly improved after long-term statin administration in most patients with severe small vessel disease, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, or impaired baseline CA. Atorvastatin decreases computed tomography and S100-assessed brain ischemia after subarachnoid aneurysmal hemorrhage: a comparative study. In the overall population, cerebral vasospasm was significantly less common in the statin-treated group. Severity of vasospasm, as assessed on the most severe angiogram, was lowered with statin. Statins significantly reduced volume of ischemia in patients with vasospasm and an uncomplicated coiling procedure. S100B levels were significantly lower in statin-treated patients, and the decrease was greatest among high-grade patients (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 3-5). No differences were found between statin-treated and untreated groups regarding rescue therapy intensity or 1-yr clinical outcomes. Atorvastatin reduces the incidence, the severity and the ischemic consequences of vasospasm as assessed on computed tomography. In high-grade World Federation of Neurological Surgeons patients, atorvastatin decreases serum levels of S100B, a biomarker of brain ischemia. Despite these positive effects on biomarkers, no improvement of outcome was seen in the overall population, although there was a tendency for a better clinical outcome in high-grade patients. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been associated with improved clinical outcomes after ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage, but with an increased risk of incidental spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Statins are known to have pleiotropic vascular effects, some of which may interrupt the pathogenesis of DNDs. Based on promising preliminary reports, many clinicians routinely administer statins to prevent DNDs. However, observational studies have not revealed an association between statin-use and reduced DNDs or improved neurological outcomes. Results of RCTs have been inconsistent and limited by small sample size, but together suggest that statins may reduce DNDs, with no clear impact on mortality or neurological recovery. the role of statins in the management of patients with SAH remains unclear. Although promising, statins should not, at this time, be considered standard care. In patients with SAH, they may decrease the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, although the effects on overall outcome are less clear. Statins treatment may have potential clinical impact in vascular disease beyond cholesterol lowering. Its benefits have been documented in cerebral ischaemia and in subarachnoid haemorrhage. A recent meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of statin treatment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage reported a reduced incidence of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and mortality in statin-treated patients. The results of the present systematic review do not lend statistically significant support to the finding of a beneficial effect of statins in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as reported in a previous meta-analysis. Pre-treatment with cholesterol lowering drugs of the statin family may exert protective effects in patients with ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage but their effects are not clear in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).  Recently, two randomized controlled phase II studies showed that acute initiation of statin treatment directly after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) decreases the incidence of radiologic vasospasm and clinical signs of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and even reduces mortality. We conclude that both the primary and secondary outcome results of this study do not support a beneficial effect of simvastatin in patients with SAH. Novel uses of their anti-inflammatory properties in sepsis and vasomotor properties in subarachnoid haemorrhage are being further investigated by randomised trials. A trend towards a lower mortality within 14 days in patients receiving solely simvastatin and those receiving statin and magnesium as compared with the control group was found.  Initiation of statin therapy after aneurysmal SAH significantly reduces the incidence of vasospasm, delayed ischemic deficits, and mortality. The addition of statins to standard care was not associated with any reduction in the development of vasospasm or improvement in outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  We have previously demonstrated that acute pravastatin therapy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ameliorates vasospasm-related delayed ischemic deficits.  This trial demonstrates that acute statin treatment reduces traditional rescue therapy for vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Improvement in early outcome has proved robust at 6 months, particularly in relation to physical and psychosocial (Short Form 36) outcome. The authors previously have demonstrated that acute treatment with pravastatin after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can ameliorate vasospasm-related delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs). The neuroprotective effects of acute treatment with pravastatin following aneurysmal SAH are associated with enhancement of autoregulation Simvastatin reduces vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: results of a pilot randomized clinical trial. The use of simvastatin as prophylaxis against delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal SAH is a safe and well-tolerated intervention. Its use attenuates serum markers associated with brain injury and decreases the incidence of radiographic vasospasm and delayed ischemic deficit. Acute treatment with pravastatin after aSAH is safe and ameliorates cerebral vasospasm, improves cerebral autoregulation, and reduces vasospasm-related DID.  SAH statin users demonstrated significant improvement in 14-day functional outcome, a significantly lower incidence of DCI and cerebral infarctions of any type, as well as prevention of TCD highest mean velocity elevation. However, we did not find a significant statin impact on mortality or global outcome (Modified Rankin Scale) in this small sample."
Isn't there a role for transcription factories in genome organization?,no,"The mammalian nucleus is a highly complex structure that carries out a diverse range of functions such as DNA replication, cell division, RNA processing, and nuclear export/import. Many of these activities occur at discrete subcompartments that intersect with specific regions of the genome. Over the past few decades, evidence has accumulated to suggest that RNA transcription also occurs in specialized sites, called transcription factories, that may influence how the genome is organized. There may be certain efficiency benefits to cluster transcriptional activity in this way. However, the clustering of genes at transcription factories may have consequences for genome stability, and increase the susceptibility to recurrent chromosomal translocations that lead to cancer In the eukaryotic nucleus, genes are transcribed in transcription factories Based on this analysis, we propose that transcription factories result from the aggregation of RNA polymerase II-containing pre-initiation complexes assembled next to each other in the nuclear space. Such an aggregation can be triggered by the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II molecules and their interaction with various transcription factors. Individual transcription factories would thus incorporate tissue-specific, co-regulated as well as housekeeping genes based only on their initial proximity to each other in the nuclear space active polymerases cluster into replication and transcription ""factories"" in both pro- and eukaryotes. We conclude that the second law of thermodynamics acts through nonspecific entropic forces between engaged polymerases to drive the self-organization of genomes into loops containing several thousands (and sometimes millions) of basepairs Since the advent of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), there have been major advances in our understanding of how the genome is organized in interphase nuclei. Indeed, this organization is found to be non-random and individual chromosomes occupy discrete regions known as territories  in proliferating cells, there is evidently a correlation between radial positioning and gene density. Indeed, gene-poor chromosomes tend to be located towards the nuclear edge, while those that are more gene-rich are positioned more internally Recently described active chromatin hubs and transcription factories also involve long-range interactions The transcription factory model has implications for the regulation of transcription initiation and elongation, for the organization of genes in the genome, for the co-regulation of genes and for genome instability."
Are microtubules marked by glutamylation?,yes,"Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and function. Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule- interacting proteins. Enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family posttranslationally modify and thereby mark microtubules by glutamylation, generating specific recognition sites for microtubule-interacting proteins.  PTMs of the cytoskeleton, including phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, detyrosination/tyrosination, (poly)glutamylation and (poly)glycylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and palmitoylation, will be addressed in this chapter. The tubulin posttranslational modifications: acetylation, detyrosination, polyglutamylation, and polyglycylation play important roles in microtubule functions In most eukaryotic cells, tubulin is subjected to posttranslational glutamylation, a conserved modification of unclear function."
Are there ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast?,yes,"Here, we present a systematic study of ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast based on the publicly available genome sequences, in order to reveal their relationship with the adaptability or fitness advantages of the budding yeast.Results: Our results indicate that, in addition to some fundamental biological functions, the UCSs play an important role in the adaptation of S. cerevisiae to the acidic environment, which is backed up by the previous observation. Besides that, we also find the highly unchanged genes (HUGs) are enriched in some other pathways, such as the nutrient-sensitive signaling pathway. To facilitate the investigation of unique UCSs, the UCSC Genome Browser was utilized to visualize the chromosomal position and related annotations of UCSs in S. cerevisiae genome. Here, we present a systematic study of ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast based on the publicly available genome sequences, in order to reveal their relationship with the adaptability or fitness advantages of the budding yeast."
Can administration of the thyrotropin releasing hormone reduce fatigue in cancer patients?,yes,"TRH administration was associated with significant improvement (p < 0.05) in fatigue levels as measured by the Visual Analog Scale-Energy (VAS-E), was associated with significant (p < 0.05) improvement in sleep disturbances and improved quality of life.  This decrease in CRP level with TRH administration was associated with improvement in energy levels as measured by the VAS-E.  In the present pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of TRH as a treatment for CF. TRH administration was associated with significant improvement in fatigue level as measured by the VAS-E, the fatigue and vigor subscales of the POMS, and the fatigue subscale of FACIT-F (p < 0.05).  TRH administration was efficacious, safe, and tolerable in the treatment of CF with a positive impact on quality of life. These results provide a crucial impetus for pursuing TRH therapeutics to treat CF. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone can relieve cancer-related fatigue: hypothesis and preliminary observations. Global assessment using both subjective and objective parameters showed that TRH exerted clear anti-fatigue effects in four of the six TRH treatments.  These initial findings support the proposal that TRH can ameliorate cancer-related fatigue."
Can't valproic acid act as an activator of AMPK?,no,"Here we demonstrate that VPA is a novel activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular metabolism, using primary mouse and human hepatocytes.

Does verubecestat activate BACE?,no,Verubecestat is a potent BACE1 enzyme inhibitor currently being investigated in Phase III trials for the treatment of mild-to-moderate and prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
Is Enlimomab effective for stroke treatment?,no,"However, this treatment failed to show benefit in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial. There was no increase in the frequency of adverse events with increasing doses of enlimomab.CONCLUSIONS: Doses of enlimomab between 140 and 480 mg administered over 5 days did not increase the risk of adverse events in patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke during an observation period of 30 +/- 10 days. Examination of several potential mechanisms for the negative outcome in a clinical stroke trial of enlimomab, a murine anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 antibody: a bedside-to-bench study. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enlimomab, a murine monoclonal anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 antibody, had a negative outcome in a multicenter acute-stroke trial.  These observations provide several possible mechanisms for central nervous system-related clinical deterioration that occurred when Enlimomab was given in acute ischemic stroke. Fewer patients had symptom-free recovery on enlimomab than placebo (p = 0.004), and more died (22.2 versus 16.2%). The negative effect of enlimomab was apparent on days 5, 30, and 90 of treatment (p = 0.005). There were significantly more adverse events with enlimomab treatment than placebo, primarily infections and fever.  CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that anti-ICAM therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome. Patients experiencing fever were more likely to have a poor outcome or die.The authors conclude that anti-ICAM therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome.

Don't have 5q35 microdeletions been implicated in Sotos syndrome development?,no,"Loss-of-function mutations of NSD1 and 5q35 microdeletions encompassing NSD1 are a major cause of Sotos syndrome (Sos), which is characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, characteristic facies, and variable intellectual disability (ID) We observed a novel 3.5 Mb 5q subtelomeric deletion in a 3-year-old girl with developmental delay, hypotonia and multiple minor anomalies. Comparison of her phenotype with the few published patients with terminal 5q35 deletions revealed several overlapping features, but also showed remarkable differences such as shortness of stature versus macrosomia. After the report of 5q35.3 microdeletions in Sotos syndrome we integrated the published BACs into the public draft sequence and exactly mapped the deletion size in our patient by FISH analysis with 15 BAC probes. We demonstrated that the deletion in our patient is immediately adjacent to the reported Sotos syndrome deletion site Switch in FGFR3 and -4 expression profile during human renal development may account for transient hypercalcemia in patients with Sotos syndrome due to 5q35 microdeletions. Multiple mechanisms are implicated in the generation of 5q35 microdeletions in Sotos syndrome.

Can't we use platelet biomarkers to study Alzheimer's disease?,no,"Platelet biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease. platelets are the most important source of circulating forms of the amyloid precursor protein and other important proteins such as Tau and glycogen synthase kinase-3B. Alternative plasma and platelet measures are described, The success of these studies led to the application of platelet proteomics to the study of several pathologies where platelets play a fundamental role. Those include platelet-related disorders, such as storage pool disease, gray platelet syndrome, and Quebec platelet disorder; diseases where unwanted platelet activation is highly relevant, such as thrombosis and cardiovascular disease; and other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, uremia, or Alzheimer's disease."
Do all archaea possess multiple origins of DNA replication?,no,"Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Replication starts at a single Ori site in bacteria, but in eukaryotes multiple Ori sites are used for fast copying across all chromosomes. The situation becomes complex in archaea, where some groups have single and others have multiple origins of replication. Results from this in silico analysis show that the Themococcales have a single origin of replication. Until recently, the only archaeon for which a bona fide origin of replication was reported was Pyrococcus abyssi, where a single origin was identified. Although several in silico analyses have suggested that some archaeal species might contain more than one origin, this has only been demonstrated recently. In bacteria and eukaryotes, replication initiates from single and multiple origins, respectively, while archaea can adopt either of the two modes. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins.

Are high-flow nasal cannulae effective for treatment of preterm infants?,yes,"The use of high-flow nasal cannulae is an increasingly popular alternative to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for noninvasive respiratory support of very preterm infants (gestational age, <32 weeks) after extubation. The use of high-flow nasal cannulae was noninferior to the use of nasal CPAP, with treatment failure occurring in 52 of 152 infants (34.2%) in the nasal-cannulae group and in 39 of 151 infants (25.8%) in the CPAP group (risk difference, 8.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.9 to 18.7).  Although the result for the primary outcome was close to the margin of noninferiority, the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannulae was similar to that of CPAP as respiratory support for very preterm infants after extubation.  Recently high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is emerging as an efficient, better tolerated form of NIV, allowing better access to the baby's face, which may improve nursing, feeding and bonding. In conclusion, there is a growing evidence of the feasibility of HFNC as an alternative mode of NIV.  HHHFNC and NCPAP produced similar rates of extubation failure. The use of HFNC as a respiratory support modality is increasing in the infant, pediatric, and adult populations as an alternative to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Current evidence suggests that HFNC is well tolerated and may be feasible in a subset of patients who require ventilatory support with non-invasive ventilation. Heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HHHFNC) has been used to improve ventilation in preterm infants.  Increasing flow rates of HHHFNC therapy are associated with linear increases in NP pressures in bronchiolitis patients.  An alternative to the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) as a non-invasive modality to support respiratory distress in premature infants has been the recent introduction of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) devices in many neonatal units. There has been increased use of HFNC presumably because of anecdotal reports and experience that it is easy to use, and well tolerated by the infants, while experiencing decreased nasal septumerosion. High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are gaining in popularity as a form of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units around the world. HFNC may be as effective as NCPAP at improving respiratory parameters such as tidal volume and work of breathing in preterm infants, but probably only at flow rates >2 litres/min.  There is growing evidence of the feasibility of HFNC as an alternative to other forms of non-invasive ventilation in preterm infants.  When used as primary respiratory support after birth, one trial found similar rates of treatment failure in infants treated with HFNC and nasal CPAP. Following extubation, one trial found that infants treated with HFNC had a significantly higher rate of reintubation than those treated with nasal CPAP. Another trial found similar rates of reintubation for humidified and non-humidified HFNC, and the fourth trial found no difference between two different models of equipment used to deliver humidified HFNC.  When used following extubation, HFNC may be associated with a higher rate of reintubation than nasal CPAP.  Early weaning from CPAP to high flow nasal cannula in preterm infants is associated with prolonged oxygen requirement: a randomized controlled trial. After randomization, the no-NC group had fewer days on oxygen [median (interquartile range): 5 (1-8) vs 14 (7.5-19.25) days, p<0.001] and shorter duration of respiratory support [10.5 (4-21) vs 18 (11.5-29) days, p=0.03]. There were no differences between groups regarding success of weaning from NCPAP.  Weaning preterm infants from NCPAP to NC is associated with increased exposure to oxygen and longer duration of respiratory support. A number of centers use high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in the management of AOP without measuring the positive distending pressure (PDP) generated. HFNC is as effective as NCPAP in the management of AOP."
Aren't retroviruses used for gene therapy?,no,"Several immunodeficiencies have been treated successfully by stem cell-targeted, retroviral-mediated gene transfer with reconstitution of the immune system following infusion of the transduced cells. In this work we have developed and tested a self-inactivating (SIN) gammaretroviral vector (SINfes.gp91s) containing a codon-optimized transgene (gp91(phox)) under the transcriptional control of a myeloid promoter for the gene therapy of the X-linked form of CGD (X-CGD).  We used a lentiviral vector encoding functional WASP to genetically correct HSPCs from three WAS patients and reinfused the cells after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen We used a lentiviral vector to transfer a functional ARSA gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from three presymptomatic patients who showed genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological evidence of late infantile MLD.  We assessed lentiviral vectors (LVs) targeted to the EC surface marker CD105 for in vivo gene delivery. gef and apoptin genes were cloned into a doxycycline-regulated retrovirus-mediated gene expression system."
Isn't irritable bowel syndrome more common in women with endometriosis?,no,"CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid pain syndromes, mood conditions and asthma are common in adolescents and young women with endometriosis. There are many etiologies of pelvic pain that present with symptoms resembling those of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain that are not diagnosable with laparoscopy, such as interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Often, such patients are labelled with irritable bowel syndrome.  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis.  RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with minimal to mild and moderate to severe endometriosis had a higher prevalence of symptoms consistent with IBS (0% vs 65% and 50%, respectively, p<0.001) with significantly lower mean pain thresholds (39.5 mm Hg (95% CI 36.0 to 43.0) vs 28.1 mm Hg (95% CI 24.5 to 31.6), p=0.001 and 28.8 mm Hg (95% CI 24.9 to 32.6), p=0.002) not explained by differences in rectal compliance.  Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1.9, 95% CI (1.03-3.87)]. A weak association between reported family history of endometriosis and history of irritable bowel syndrome and the development of endometriosis was also observed.  Irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation in patients with endometriosis. Fifteen per cent of the patients with endometriosis also had IBS and 14% of the patients with endometriosis had functional constipation without IBS. CONCLUSION: In patients with endometriosis, 29% also had IBS or constipation.  Seventy-six women (21.4%) had previously been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and 79% of them had endometriosis confirmed. Compared with controls, women with endometriosis had increased risks of abdominopelvic pain (OR 5.2 [95% CI: 4.7-5.7]), dysmenorrhoea (OR 8.1 [95% CI: 7.2-9.3]), menorrhagia (OR 4.0 [95% CI: 3.5-4.5]), subfertility (OR 8.2 [95% CI: 6.9-9.9]), dyspareunia and/or postcoital bleeding (OR 6.8 [95% CI: 5.7-8.2]), and ovarian cysts (OR 7.3 [95% CI: 5.7-9.4]), and of being diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (OR 1.6 [95% CI: 1.3-1.8]) or pelvic inflammatory disease (OR 3.0 [95% CI: 2.5-3.6]). Endometriosis may coexist with or be misdiagnosed as pelvic inflammatory disease or IBS. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, women with endometriosis were 3.5 times more likely to have received a diagnosis of IBS (OR 3.5 [95% CI: 3.1-3.9]). Even after women had been diagnosed with endometriosis, they were still two and a half times more likely to receive a new diagnosis of IBS when compared with the controls (OR 2.5 [95% CI: 2.2-2.8]). CONCLUSIONS: Women with endometriosis are more likely to be diagnosed with IBS and PID than controls, even after a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis has been reached. In women, clinical studies suggest that functional pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia, are co-morbid with endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, and others diseases. In women, clinical studies suggest that pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis, which are associated with visceral hyperalgesia, are often comorbid with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain.  Depression, anxiety, IBS, FM, CFS, and IC were more common in migraine with EM group than in controls. Intestinal endometriosis can mimic many gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, infections and neoplasms. Endometriosis is often associated with other painful conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis and fibromyalgia.  CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered in women with recurrent monthly abdominal pain and bowel symptoms, especially if accompanied by gynaecologic complaints, even because the significant symptoms overlap with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and makes the differentiation extremely difficult. Intestinal endometriosis is typically asymptomatic; however, when symptoms occur, they can mimic those of irritable bowel syndrome.  Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis."
Is peripheral neuroepithelioma related to Ewing sarcoma?,yes,"The term ""small round-cell tumor"" describes a group of highly aggressive malignant tumors composed of relatively small and monotonous undifferentiated cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios. This group includes Ewing's sarcoma (ES), peripheral neuroepithelioma (aka, primitive neuroectodermal tumor or extraskeletal ES), peripheral neuroblastoma (""classic-type""), rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round-cell tumor, lymphoma, leukemia, small-cell osteosarcoma, small-cell carcinoma (either undifferentiated or neuroendocrine), olfactory neuroblastoma, cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma (aka, Merkel-cell carcinoma), small-cell melanoma, and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Their clinical presentations often overlap, thus making a definitive diagnosis problematic in some cases AIMS: To retrospectively study the DNA content in a series of childhood Ewing Family Tumors (EFT), and to investigate its prognostic value. METHODS: The study was performed on a series of 27 EFTs (osseous Ewing's sarcoma, 18 cases; extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma, 2; peripheral neuroepithelioma, 4; Askin Rosai tumors, 3 To improve the prognosis of patients with poor-risk peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pPNETs; including peripheral neuroepithelioma and Ewing's sarcoma) Large group of small-round-cell tumours of soft tissues and bone represents a complex diagnostic problem for the pathologists. Neuronal nature of many tumours from this group is proven by means of new methods--immunophenotypic analysis, tissue culture, cytogenetics. Peripheral neuroepithelioma, Ewing tumour, primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET), Askin tumour belong to these neoplasms Comparison of Ewing's sarcoma of bone and peripheral neuroepithelioma. An immunocytochemical and ultrastructural analysis of two primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms Ewing's sarcoma of bone (ESB) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are frequently considered to be different tumors. Some researchers have suggested that PN is morphologically a neuroectodermal Ewing's sarcoma. We sought to determine the extent of neuroectodermal features in conventional ESB on direct patient material (25 cases) and to compare these tumors with a similar group of readily diagnosed PNs (10 cases) Neuroectodermal antigens (neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7 [HNK-1], neurofilament 200 kd, and S100) were found in nine of 10 cases of PN and in 17 of 25 cases of ESB These data support the concept that ESB and PN are both peripheral primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms, differing only in extent of neuroectodermal phenotype and morphological differentiation Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin. Ewings sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs). The presence of this translocation in Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor has been taken as evidence that these two tumors are related. Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin. Indistinguishable patterns of protooncogene expression in two distinct but closely related tumors: Ewing's sarcoma and neuroepithelioma. Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12). Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (ES/pPNET) are a group of small round cell sarcomas that show varying degrees of neuroectodermal differentiation characterized by translocation involving the EWS gene Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs) Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) This genetical similarity further supports a nosological concept according to which Askin's tumour, Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma represent phenotypic variations of the same tumour, namely the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour. Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin"
Do normal cells express the protein TERT?,no,"Since telomerase has been recognized as a relevant factor distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells, it has become a very promising target for anti-cancer therapy Telomerase plays a pivotal role in cellular immortality and tumorigenesis. Its activity is normally not detectable in most somatic cells while it is reactivated in the vast majority of cancer cells. Therefore, inhibition of telomerase has been viewed as a promising anticancer approach due to its specificity for cancer cells. Telomerase activity is found in 85%-90% of all human cancers but not in their adjacent normal cells. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an essential component in the telomerase complex that plays an important role in telomerase activity. elomerase activation is considered to be a critical step in carcinogenesis and its activity correlates closely with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression. Since only tumor cells that express telomerase activity would activate this promoter, the hTERT proximal promoter allows for preferential expression of viral genes in tumor cells, leading to selective viral replication"
Isn't paramyxovirus involved in human subacute thyroiditis?,yes,"Most cases of subacute thyroiditis are caused by a variety of viruses, for example, Coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus. Influenza immunization or infection may cause subacute thyroiditis. Coxsackie virus has been reported to be one of the viruses associated with the disease. The etiology of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (SAT) is obscure, although it is postulated to be associated with viral infections and genetic factors. The results suggest that SAT is not usually associated with acute infections No evidence was obtained to support the proposed role of enteroviruses as an important etiologic agent of SAT. The viral antibodies evaluated were those of Influenza A and B, Coxsackie A9, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 and B6, Echo 3, 7, 11 and 12, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, and Adeno 8 virus. The following results were obtained: In class I HLA typing, the frequency of HLA-Bw35 in SAT was 67.4%, which was significantly (p less than 0.0001) higher than that in the control (14.1%). On the other hand, the frequency of Cw1 in SAT (14.6%) was significantly (p less than 0.01) lower than that of the control (32.1%), and that of Cw3 (65.2%) was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that of the control (46.5%)."
Has the protein GFP been used in transgenesis for live protein imaging?,yes,"we review recent advancement in the functional studies of the three different GnRH neuron systems, mainly focusing on the electrophysiological analysis of the GnRH-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic animals. founders were found to be transgenic for GFP. GFP expression was detected in a wide range of murine tissues Transgenic Xenopus laevis for live imaging in cell and developmental biology. The stable transgenesis of genes encoding functional or spatially localized proteins, fused to fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or red fluorescent protein (RFP), is an extremely important research tool in cell and developmental biology. GFP-transgenic animals for in vivo imaging: rats, rabbits, and pigs. We have further extended the techniques of genetic engineering to rats, rabbits, and pigs, and have created corresponding GFP-transgenic animals. The results revealed that the 3.6-GFP transgenic animals provide a unique model for direct analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of pulp repair and tertiary dentinogenesis in vivo. Long-term effects of PERV-specific RNA interference in transgenic pigs. green fluorescent protein (GFP) as reporter of the vector system were consistently expressed in transgenic animals. The ability to specify the expression levels of exogenous genes inserted in the genomes of transgenic animals is critical for the success of a wide variety of experimental manipulations.  Welfare assessment in transgenic pigs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). transgenic animals expressing GFP with wildtype animals along various stages of post natal development Production of transgenic chickens expressing a tetracycline-inducible GFP gene. transgenic animals can be readily created to express fluorescently tagged proteins or reporters These findings suggest that mhc2dab:GFP and cd45:DsRed transgenic lines will be instrumental in elucidating the immune response in the zebrafish. f 33 mice born, 28 (81%) carried the transgene DNA and 15 (55.5%) were GFP-positive. Lentiviral vectors containing the green fluorescent protein gene have been successfully used to select transgenic embryos before transfer to a surrogate mother Typically transgenes are generated by placing a promoter upstream of a GFP reporter gene or cDNA of interest, and this often produces a representative expression pattern. Survival and immunogenicity of mesenchymal stem cells from the green fluorescent protein transgenic rat in the adult rat brain. This problem has been lessened by the availability of transgenic animals that express ""reporter"" genes, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP)  full-length GFP fusion proteins was examined, in transgenic animals,  Two stable transgenic lines express GFP prior to hair-bundle formation we generated two transgenic pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by cytomegalovirus (CMV). Fluorescent proteins such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) have widely been used in transgenic animals as reporter genes.  Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is used extensively as a reporter for transgene expression in Drosophila and other organisms."
Can't NXY-059 be used for treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients?,yes,"Even when the international recommendations for preclinical stroke research, the Stroke Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria, were followed, we have still seen limited success in the clinic, examples being NXY-059 and haematopoietic growth factors which fulfilled nearly all the STAIR criteria This occurred during 1993-2006, when the 2,4-disulfonylphenyl PBN derivative, called NXY-059 in the stroke studies, was shown to be safe in humans and was taken all the way through clinical phase 3 trials and then was deemed to be ineffective.  The nitrone-based compound NXY-059, which is the first drug to reach clinical trials for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, has provided promise for the development of more robust pharmacological agents.  OKN-007 is a proprietary compound that has had extensive commercial development (designated as NXY-059) for another indication, acute ischemic stroke, and after extensive clinical studies was shown to lack efficacy for this indication but was shown to be very safe for human use.  NXY-059, a polar compound with limited transport across the blood-brain barrier, has demonstrated neuroprotection in several animal models of acute ischemic stroke but failed to confirm clinical benefit in the second phase III trial (SAINT-II). NXY-059 is no longer in development following a lack of efficacy found in a Phase III trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke.  We analyzed the quality and adequacy of animal studies supporting the efficacy of NXY-059 and other neuroprotective agents that are currently being investigated in phase II/III trials  In the aftermath of the failed stroke clinical trials with the nitrone spin trap/radical scavenger, NXY-059, a number of articles raised the question: are we doing the right thing?   In 2006, the first positive trial of neuroprotection was published: the SAINT I (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment) study. In February 2008, the SAINT II study was published, indicating that NXY-059 was not effective for AIS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for treatment of AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The SAINT I trial that showed a significant benefit of the neuroprotectant NXY-059 used a novel outcome for acute ischemic stroke trials: a shift toward good functional outcome on the 7-category modified Rankin scale (mRS). BACKGROUND: The free-radical-trapping agent NXY-059 showed promise as a neuroprotectant in the Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment I (SAINT I) trial, reducing disability when given to patients who had acute ischemic stroke.  CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. The continued failure in approving new drugs for treatment of acute stroke has been recently set back by the failure of the NXY-059 (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment (SAINT) II) trial. The SAINT II Trial, a large randomized multicenter clinical trial of the putative neuroprotectant, NXY-059, failed to demonstrate a treatment benefit in acute ischemic stroke.  The positive results from the first Stroke-Acute-Ischaemic-NXY-Treatment (SAINT-I) trial of the free-radical spin-trap drug, NXY-059, which followed many of the STAIR guidelines, reinvigorated enthusiasm in neuroprotection, but the SAINT-II trial did not replicate the positive effect on the same primary prespecified outcome measure.  NXY-059, a free radical spin trap agent, was felt by many to have followed these criteria and it was recently shown to improve outcome in AIS patients in the SAINT I trial. However, the repeat, SAINT II trial was a neutral study, the results of which cast doubt on neuroprotection as a viable strategy for AIS.  NXY-059 is a novel free radical-trapping neuroprotectant that reduces infarct size and preserves brain function in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. It is the first neuroprotectant to demonstrate a reduction in global disability in a phase III clinical trial, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NXY-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 within 6 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly reduced disability.  CONCLUSIONS: The administration of NXY-059 within six hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke significantly improved the primary outcome (reduced disability at 90 days), but it did not significantly improve other outcome measures, including neurologic functioning as measured by the NIHSS score. Additional research is needed to confirm whether NXY-059 is beneficial in ischemic stroke.  BACKGROUND: The free-radical-trapping agent NXY-059 showed promise as a neuroprotectant in the Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment I (SAINT I) trial, reducing disability when given to patients who had acute ischemic stroke. NXY-059 is no longer in development following a lack of efficacy found in a Phase III trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Aren't histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors good candidates to control metastasis of solid tumors?,no,"JNJ-26481585 also fully inhibited the growth of C170HM2 colorectal liver metastases, whereas again 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin showed modest activity. Although not meeting the RECIST response criteria for adequate single-agent activity, the observed tolerable toxicities and the potential for clinical benefit in terms of stable disease suggest that further assessment of vorinostat as a part of combination therapy with either chemotherapeutic or targeted agents in metastatic breast might be undertaken. Treatments of different structural classes of HDACi simultaneously induced cell death and promoted cell migration and metastasis in multiple cancer cell types. Suppression of HDACi-induced PKCs leads to development of low toxic and long-term therapeutic strategies to potentially treat cancer as a chronic disease. mRNA expression analysis of lung tumor bearing mice suggested that the enhanced chemopreventive activity of the combination is related to atorvastatin modulation of DNA repair, SAHA modulation of angiogenesis, and both drugs modulating invasion and metastasis pathways. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induced morphologic differentiation, cell-cycle exit, and a shift to a differentiated, melanocytic gene expression profile in cultured UM cells. VPA inhibited the growth of UM tumors in vivo. When both drugs were used in concert additive effects were observed on the migratory and invasive behavior but not on tumor-endothelium and tumor-matrix interaction. Separate mTOR or HDAC inhibition slows processes related to tumor metastasis. The RAD001-VPA combination showed advantage over VPA monotreatment with particular respect to migration and invasion. In conclusion, sequential treatments of mice with MS-275 followed by TRAIL may target multiple pathways to reverse EMT and inhibit tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis and represent a novel therapeutic approach to treat cancer. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. We report the first preclinical data for the prevention of brain metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer. Vorinostat is brain permeable and can prevent the formation of brain metastases by 62%. Its mechanism of action involves the induction of DNA double-strand breaks, suggesting rational combinations with DNA active drugs or radiation. Combining vorinostat with radiation may be a potential treatment option for patients with breast cancer who develop brain metastases. Although single-agent PCI-24781 had modest effects on STS growth and metastasis, marked inhibition was observed when combined with chemotherapy. In a 4T1 metastatic breast carcinoma model, AN-7 inhibited the formation of lung lesions by 76% and AN-9 by 47%, further demonstrating the greater efficacy of AN-7 compared to AN-9 (P<0.02). Both AN-7 and AN-9 exhibited antimetastatic and antiangiogenic activities by reducing vascularization, bFGF expression and HIF-1alpha. Since prolonged oral administration with 50 mg/kg or a single oral dose of 1.2 g/kg AN-7 did not cause adverse effects and the former exhibited significant anticancer activity, AN-7 is likely to display a high therapeutic index and may be beneficial for prostate cancer patients. We show that apicidin significantly inhibits H-ras-induced invasive phenotype of MCF10A human breast epithelial cells in parallel with a specific downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, but not MMP-9. We also show that apicidin induces a morphological reversal and growth inhibition of H-ras MCF10A cells similar to that induced by other HDAC inhibitors. We also found that NaB induced three genes, which are known metastatic suppressors, and downregulated 11 genes, which have been shown to promote metastasis."
Is sternotomy closure done using either a sternal ZipFix™ implant  or conventional steel wire following cardiac surgery?,yes,"o determine the difference in sternal infection and other infectious events between conventional wire and cable-tie-based closure techniques post-sternotomy in a collective of patients after cardiac surgery. Our study underlines a neutral effect of the sternal ZipFix™ system in patients regarding sternal infection. Postoperative complications are similar in both sternal closure methods. The cable-tie-based system is fast, easy to use, reliable and safe.  Wire closure still remains the preferred technique despite reasonable disadvantages. Associated complications, such as infection and sternal instability, cause time- and cost-consuming therapies. We present a new tool for sternal closure with its first clinical experience and results.METHODS: The sternal ZipFix(TM) System is based on the cable-tie principle.  In our initial evaluation, the short-term results have shown that the sternal ZipFix(TM) can be used safely and effectively. It is fast, easy to use and serves as a potential alternative for traditional wire closure. To determine the difference in sternal infection and other infectious events between conventional wire and cable-tie-based closure techniques post-sternotomy in a collective of patients after cardiac surgery."
Isn't TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease?,no,"Absence of TREM2 polymorphisms in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration  These data demonstrate that TREM2 coding region is highly conserved, implying a crucial role of this receptor. Further studies, including a functional analysis, are certainly required to clarify the role of TREM2 in neurodegenerative processes Moreover, a rare TREM2 exon 2 variant (p.R47H) was reported to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with an odds ratio as strong as that for APOEε4 We observed an enrichment of rare variants across TREM2 in both AD and FTD patients compared to controls, most notably in the extracellular IgV-set domain None of the rare variants individually reached significant association, but the frequency of p.R47H was increased ~ 3-fold in both AD and FTD patients compared to controls, in line with previous reports Our data corroborate and extend previous findings to include an increased frequency of rare heterozygous TREM2 variations in AD and FTD, and show that TREM2 variants may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases in general. non-synonymous genetic rare variant, rs75932628-T (p.R47H), in the TREM2 gene has recently been reported to be a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) These data strongly support the important role of p.R47H in AD risk, and suggest that this rare genetic variant is not related to FTD.  Higher levels of TREM2 mRNA (p = 0.002) and protein (p < 0.001) were identified in AD patients Our results indicate that TREM2 might serve as a novel noninvasive biomarker for AD diagnosis studies have identified the rs75932628 (R47H) variant in TREM2 as an Alzheimer's disease risk factor with estimated odds ratio ranging from 2.9 to 5.1 This study replicates the association between R47H and Alzheimer's disease risk in a large, population-based sample, and estimates the population frequency and attributable risk of this rare variant Moreover, mutation scanning of the five exons of TREM2 failed to detect the presence of novel polymorphisms A rare missense mutation (rs75932628-T) in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which was predicted to result in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease in Iceland We also found that carriers of rs75932628-T between the ages of 80 and 100 years without Alzheimer's disease had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers Our findings strongly implicate variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's disease through impaired containment of inflammatory processes rs75932628-T variant of the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) These results confirm the association between this variant and AD and underline its involvement in early-onset cases recent studies have reported the association of rs75932628-T in the TREM2 gene with the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) Rs75932628-T is a rare nonsynonymous variant (p.R47H) that confers a high risk of AD with an effect size similar to that of the APOE ɛ4 allele Here, we report the first positive replication study in a Spanish population and confirm that TREM2 rs75932628-T is associated with the risk for AD works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an odds ratio similar to that of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele The reduced function of TREM2 was speculated to be the main cause in the pathogenic effects of this risk variant, and TREM2 is highly expressed in white matter, as well as in the hippocampus and neocortex, which is partly consistent with the pathological features reported in AD brain, indicating the possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis Emerging evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 could suppress inflammatory response by repression of microglia-mediated cytokine production and secretion, which may prevent inflammation-induced bystander damage of neurons TREM2 also participates in the regulation of phagocytic pathways that are responsible for the removal of neuronal debris Based on the potential protective actions of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis, targeting TREM2 might provide new opportunities for AD treatment Under the hypothesis that low-prevalence variants showing moderate-to-high effect size may be associated with risk for sAD, two independent research groups have demonstrated that a rare variant (rs75932628, encoding a substitution of arginine by histidine at residue 47 (R47H), in the TREM2 gene, which encodes the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is significantly associated with an increased susceptibility to sAD Recently, a novel variant in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has been identified that has refocused the spotlight back onto inflammation as a major contributing factor in AD TREM gene cluster, a region recently reported to harbor rare variants that increase AD risk evidence suggests that rare genetic variants within the TREM2 gene are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease These data suggest that a mutational burden in TREM2 may serve as a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease in general, and that potentially this class of TREM2 variant carriers with dementia should be considered as having a molecularly distinct form of neurodegenerative disease The association of TREM2 variants with AD brings innate immune signaling into the light, affirming innate immunity's role as a significant factor in AD pathogenesis The purpose of this paper is to discuss these recent developments including the potential role that TREM2 normally plays and how loss of function may contribute to AD pathogenesis by enhancing oxidative stress and inflammation within the CNS Even though we are more at the beginning than at the end of sAD genetics, there is some reason for optimism given the recent identification of novel risk or protective variants (such as rare TREM2 and APP mutations) showing strong statistical associations with sAD"
Is protein M3/6 a dual specificity phosphatase?,yes,"Involvement of the dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 in c-Jun N-terminal kinase inactivation following cerebral ischemia in the rat hippocampus. The results revealed upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) activity at 4 h of reperfusion in rat hippocampi.  This study examines the molecular mechanism underlying JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation evoked by dual-specificity phosphates following cerebral ischemia. Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins.  Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8].  Here we describe two new dual specificity phosphatases of the CL100/MKP-1 family that are selective for inactivating ERK or JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases when expressed in COS-7 cells. M3/6 is the first phosphatase of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases.  We previously demonstrated that the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) MKP7 and M3/6 bind the scaffold JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) and inactivate the bound subset of JNK (1). the dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6  dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK  the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK The dual specificity phosphatases M3/6 and MKP-3 are highly selective for inactivation of distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases. Phosphorylation of the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase enhances the activation of JNK by arsenite. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Regulation of dual-specificity phosphatases M3/6 and hVH5 by phorbol esters.

Is transcapillary  albumin escape altered in diabetic patients?,yes,"On the contrary, altered TERalb and increased carotid artery intimal thickness are shown by all hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, both with normal and altered patterns of AER. Altered systemic capillary permeability characterizes insulin-resistant hypertensive patients with Metabolic Syndrome. TERalb is increased in normo-albuminuric type 1 diabetic patients."
Isn't indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease?,yes,"We and others have published observational epidemiologic studies in support of vitamins in the primary prevention of CVD, but the results from intervention studies are mixed. For vitamin E, observational data suggest benefit at doses of 100 to 400 IU/d. Results from recent large-scale trials are mixed, with some showing modest benefit but others suggesting no benefit, especially for secondary prevention. Results for B vitamins are also mixed and further complicated by the recent folate fortification of the flour supply. If greater B vitamin intake does reduce CVD, the benefits are likely to be greatest for primary prevention and in populations with intake below dietary reference standards.  In the dose-response meta-analysis, each 30 mg/day increase in vitamin C, 30 IU/day increase in vitamin E, and 1 mg/day increase in beta-carotene yielded the estimated overall relative risk for CHD of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.02), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99), and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.88-1.14), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in this meta-analysis suggest that an increase in dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins has encouraging prospects for possible CHD prevention. High levels of α-tocopherol in serum were associated with 30% lower CAD risk in another study (HR 0.71; 95%CI 0.53-0.94). Among minerals (zinc, selenium, and chromium), an inverse association between zinc and CAD was observed; levels lower than 14.1 µmol/L were associated with an increased risk for CAD (RR 1.70; 95%CI 1.21-2.38). The information available on this issue is scarce. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of these nutrients in the cardiovascular risk of patients with diabetes. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation at a dosage of 150 mg appears to decrease the inflammatory marker IL-6 in patients with CAD.  Coenzyme Q10 supplements at a dose of 150 mg can decrease oxidative stress and increase antioxidant enzyme activity in patients with CAD. A higher dose of coenzyme Q10 supplements (>150 mg/d) might promote rapid and sustainable antioxidation in patients with CAD. Alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplementation has no protective effect on macrovascular outcomes or total mortality of diabetic male smokers. Sodium selenite supplementation increases GPx-1 activity in endothelial cells and in CAD patients. Future studies have to demonstrate whether long-term CAD outcome can be improved. After 7.3 years of treatment and follow-up, a combination pill of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 did not reduce a combined end point of total cardiovascular events among high-risk women, despite significant homocysteine lowering.  In this population-based study, vitamin E use was unrelated to mortality, but this apparently null finding seems to represent a combination of increased mortality in those with severe cardiovascular disease and a possible protective effect in those without.  In this large cohort of apparently healthy US male physicians, self-selected supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C, or multivitamins was not associated with a significant decrease in total CVD or CHD mortality.  The American Heart Association has recommended consumption of a balanced diet with emphasis on antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables but has made no recommendations regarding vitamin E supplementation for the general population. Although vitamin E supplementation seems to be safe for most people, recommendations from health care professionals should reflect the uncertainty of established benefit as demonstrated in clinical trials Recent studies show that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins E and C have benefits in CHD prevention; however, supplementation with beta-carotene may have deleterious effects and is not recommended. Current evidence suggests that patients with CHD would probably benefit from taking vitamin E in a dosage of 400 IU per day and vitamin C in a dosage of 500 to 1,000 mg per day. Clinicians may also want to consider vitamin supplementation for CHD prevention in high-risk patients. Folate lowers elevated homocysteine levels, but evidence for routine supplemental use does not yet exist.  In patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, treatment with vitamin E for a mean of 4.5 years had no apparent effect on cardiovascular outcomes."
Is protein CXCR4 used as a prognostic marker of cancer?,yes,"Aberrant overexpression of CXCR4 is associated with worse overall survival, adenocarcinoma histology, distant metastasis, lymph node involvement in NSCLC. CXCR4 belongs to a family of G protein-coupled cell surface receptors and has been proved to a prognostic marker in a various tumors, including esophageal squamous cell cancer.  The chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been found to be a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, being involved in chemotaxis, stemness and drug resistance.  The chemokine receptor CXCR4 that has been shown to be implicated in PDAC tumorigenicity and aggressiveness could serve as a prognostic marker for survival after a curative-intent surgery and was associated with the pattern of tumour recurrence (distant versus local relapse). XCR4 promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis, and is a prognostic marker in a number of different types of tumors. CXCR4 has been identified as a prognostic marker for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other malignancies.  The chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been found to be a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, including breast cancer.  Upregulated expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 is an independent prognostic predictor for patients with gastric cancer. detection of CXCR4 expression will be helpful for predicting prognosis for patients with gastric cancer. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a marker of metastatic disease. High CXCR4 level in cancer specimens independently predicts a poor outcome for patients with node-positive breast cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the high levels of nuclear CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression in hepatocytes were significantly better prognostic factors for overall and hepatic disease-free survival in patients with CLM. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been implicated in sarcoma development and has been found to be a prognostic marker for poor clinical outcome.  high CXCR4 expression is correlated to shorter DFS and could be used as a prognostic marker in order to stratify melanoma patients at higher progression risk."

Yersinia pestis causes the fatal respiratory disease pneumonic plague Pneumonic plague is a deadly respiratory disease caused by Yersinia pestis On July 8, 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) laboratory identified Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, in a blood specimen collected from a man (patient A) hospitalized with pneumonia. Early emergence of Yersinia pestis as a severe respiratory pathogen. The aerosol form of the bacterium Yersinia pestis causes the pneumonic plague, a rapidly fatal disease  plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, has historically been regarded as one of the deadliest pathogens known to mankind, having caused three major pandemics. After being transmitted by the bite of an infected flea arthropod vector, Y. pestis can cause three forms of human plague: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, Plague is an infectious disease caused by the Yersinia pestis microorganism, which is transmitted to the human host from a natural reservoir (different rodent species) by a flea bite. Plague is still encountered in humans in the areas of its enzootic prevalence in local rodent populations. Infection by flea bite results in a bubonic or septicemic plague, possibly complicated by secondary pneumonia. The person with pneumonic symptoms may be a source of a droplet-borne inhalatory infection for other people who consequently develop primary pneumonic plague.  uring pneumonic plague, the bacterium Yersinia pestis elicits the development of inflammatory lung lesions that continue to expand throughout infection.  In November 2006, the Uganda Ministry of Health received reports of an increase in bubonic plague cases and a possible outbreak of pneumonic plague among residents in the Arua and Nebbi districts.  Pneumonic plague is a fatal disease caused by Yersinia pestis that is associated with a delayed immune response in the lungs"
Isn't the petrous bone used in ancient DNA sampling?,no,"Large-scale genomic analyses of ancient human populations have become feasible partly due to refined sampling methods. The inner part of petrous bones and the cementum layer in teeth roots are currently recognized as the best substrates for such research. Ancient DNA (aDNA) research involves invasive and destructive sampling procedures that are often incompatible with anthropological, anatomical, and bioarcheological analyses requiring intact skeletal remains.

WAT is mainly involved in the storage and mobilization of energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas BAT specializes in dissipating energy as heat during cold- or diet-induced thermogenesis. Because brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy in the form of heat, increasing energy expenditure by augmenting BAT-mediated thermogenesis may represent an approach to counter obesity and its complications. Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. This nonshivering thermogenesis is crucial for mammals as a defense against cold and obesity/diabetes. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat cells produces heat by dissipating the energy generated by fatty acid and glucose oxidation. Brown fat biology and thermogenesis. Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat.  Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. Calorimetric measurements from cell suspensions showed that ATP increased basal heat production of isolated brown fat cells by approximately 40% but had no effect on the greater than fivefold increase in heat production seen with maximal adrenergic stimulation. Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or to excessive energy intake; stimulation of brown fat development and function may thus counteract obesity. The occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells that has been revealed in 65 out of the total 180 samples (36%), suggests that the oxidation of fat for the thermogenesis proceeds in the brown fat tissue and that brown fat cells partially undergo fat depletion. Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified ""beige"" or ""brite"" cells are activated by β-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1 The ability of brown adipocytes (fat cells) to dissipate energy as heat shows great promise for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders Inappropriate heat dissipation ignites brown fat thermogenesis in mice with a mutant thyroid hormone receptor α1 Brown fat and vascular heat dissipation: The new cautionary tail Brown adipose produces heat as a defense against hypothermia and obesity, and the appearance of brown-like adipocytes within white adipose tissue depots is associated with improved metabolic phenotypes.  In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers.  Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production.  It is inferred that brown-adipose-tissue heat production is reduced during (and probably also some time after) anesthesia.  Parallel measurements of heat production and thermogenin content in brown fat cells during cold acclimation of rats. The classical white adipose tissue builds up energy in the form of triglycerides and is useful for preventing fatigue during periods of low caloric intake and the brown adipose tissue instead of inducing fat accumulation can produce energy as heat. In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified ""beige"" or ""brite"" cells are activated by β-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1. White adipose tissue stores energy reserves as fat, whereas the metabolic function of brown adipose tissue is lipid oxidation to produce heat. The main function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is to produce heat in response to cold. Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or caloric overfeeding. Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat. Adipose tissue plays an active role in energy balance because it is not only a lipid storing and mobilizing tissue but consists of functionally specialized tissues able to produce heat (in brown adipose tissue) and to produce or release a vast number of so called adipokines or adipocytokines. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), a specialized fat that dissipates energy to produce heat, plays an important role in the regulation of energy balance. Brown adipose cells are specialized to dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat, as a physiological defence against cold and obesity. In the present study, the thermogenesis of human brown fat tissue was suggested chiefly with regard to the occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells. In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers. Adult humans have heat-producing and energy-consuming brown adipose tissue in the clavicular region of the neck. Brown and beige adipocytes expend chemical energy to produce heat and are therefore important in regulating body temperature and body weight. In human perirenal brown fat tissue, darkly stained fat-depleted cells (D) occupy, with other cell types (CR, CR'), an important part in the reversible heat production cycle of the brown fat tissue. Brown fat is a specialized fat depot that can increase energy expenditure and produce heat."
Does SARM1 deletion cause neurodegeneration?,no,"Finally, using neurons from two distinct mutant mouse strains whose axons are highly resistant to neurodegeneration (Wld(S) and Sarm1(-/-)), we found that the three different fibrils were secreted by axons after anterograde transport, in the absence of axonal lysis, indicating that trans-neuronal spread can occur in intact healthy neurons."

"Doesn't do the concentration of protein HIF-1α increase after the administration of the cytoprotective prodrug""amifostine"" (ethyol) ?",no,"We demonstrated that the treatment of several human cancer cell lines with therapeutical doses of WR-1065 led to a strong induction of different VEGF-A mRNA isoforms independently of HIF-1alpha e investigated the involvement of hypoxia-regulated proteins (Hypoxia inducible factors HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and carbonic anhydrase CA9) in HNC resistance to accelerated and hypofractionated radiotherapy In accord with previously reported studies, high levels of the hypoxia regulated proteins HIF1alpha and CA9 in HNC predict resistance to platinum based radio-chemotherapy. Whether HIF2alpha expressing tumors are more sensitive to larger radiotherapy fractions, compared to standard radiotherapy fractionation, is an issue that deserves further investigation. HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha were expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm of cancer cells, while CA9 had a membrane reactivity. A high expression of HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9 was noted in 21/39 (53.8%), 20/39 (51.3%) and 23/39 (58.9%) cases, respectively.

Isn't TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease in humans?,no,"Genetic deficits and loss of function for the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2; encoded at chr6p21.1), a transmembrane spanning stimulatory receptor of the immunoglobulin/lectin-like gene superfamily, have been associated with deficiencies in phagocytosis and the innate immune system in Alzheimer's disease. Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis. TREM2 is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Spanish population. Two recent studies have reported the association of rs75932628-T in the TREM2 gene with the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). we report the first positive replication study in a Spanish population and confirm that TREM2 rs75932628-T is associated with the risk for AD. (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we examined the association between TREM2 exon 2 variants and early-onset AD in a sample of Caucasian subjects of French origin including 726 patients with age of onset ≤65 years and 783 controls. We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.001). Our findings strongly implicate variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's disease Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an odds ratio similar to that of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. The rs75932628-T variant of the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACKGROUND: Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous rare variants in TREM2 are associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: A rare missense mutation (rs75932628-T) in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which was predicted to result in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease in Iceland (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09 to 4.09; P=3.42×10(-10))."
Can RG7112 inhibit MDM2?,yes,"To assess the influence of the p53 regulatory pathway further, we studied the effect of RG7112, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with MDM2, on normal megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. RG7112 (2g) is the first clinical small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor designed to occupy the p53-binding pocket of MDM2. Effect of the MDM2 antagonist RG7112 on the P53 pathway in patients with MDM2-amplified, well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma: an exploratory proof-of-mechanism study. We report a proof-of-mechanism study of RG7112, a small-molecule MDM2 antagonist, in patients with chemotherapy-naive primary or relapsed well-differentiated or dedifferentiated MDM2-amplified liposarcoma who were eligible for resection. To assess the influence of the p53 regulatory pathway further, we studied the effect of RG7112, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with MDM2, on normal megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. Discovery of RG7112: A Small-Molecule MDM2 Inhibitor in Clinical Development. RG7112 was the first small-molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitor in clinical development. RG7112 binds MDM2 with high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. RG7112 is a selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The effects of RG7112 and Peg-IFNα 2a on MPN progenitor cells were dependent on blocking p53-MDM2 interactions and activating the p53 pathway, thereby increasing MPN CD34(+) cell apoptosis The orally bioavailable MDM2 antagonist RG7112 and pegylated interferon α 2a target JAK2V617F-positive progenitor and stem cells Initial testing of the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program In this issue of Blood, Lu et al describe the cooperation between an orally bioavailable mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) antagonist (RG7112) and the pegylated interferon α (Peg-IFNα 2a) to target JAK2V617F hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells MDM2 small-molecule antagonist RG7112 activates p53 signaling and regresses human tumors in preclinical cancer models. Activation of p53 by the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 impairs thrombopoiesis. The orally bioavailable MDM2 antagonist RG7112 and pegylated interferon α 2a target JAK2V617F-positive progenitor and stem cells. Initial testing of the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. The primary endpoint was to assess markers of RG7112-dependent MDM2 inhibition and P53 pathway activation (P53, P21, MDM2, Ki-67, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 [MIC-1], and apoptosis).  RG7112 is a selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RG7112 was selected for evaluation by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) due to the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations in pediatric cancers compared with adult malignancies. However, the hydrophobic protein-protein interaction surface represents a significant challenge for the development of small-molecule inhibitors with desirable pharmacological profiles. RG7112 was the first small-molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitor in clinical development. Treatment with low doses of RG7112, an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of p53-MDM2, both alone and combined with pegylated interferon α 2a (Peg-IFNα 2a), significantly decreased MPN colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage and burst-forming unit-erythroid numbers and preferentially eliminated the total number of JAKV617F(+) MPN hematopoietic progenitor cells. The effects of RG7112 and Peg-IFNα 2a on MPN progenitor cells were dependent on blocking p53-MDM2 interactions and activating the p53 pathway, thereby increasing MPN CD34(+) cell apoptosis. RG7112 (2g) is the first clinical small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor designed to occupy the p53-binding pocket of MDM2. In cancer cells expressing wild-type p53, RG7112 stabilizes p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition or regression of human tumor xenografts."
Is the mouse Sry gene locus free of repetitive sequences?,no,"We demonstrate that the presence of long inverted repeats (IR) flanking the mouse Sry gene leads to the formation of the Sry circular transcript in cultured cells Circularization requires the presence of both IR. As few as 400 complementary nt are necessary for this process The presence of the IR does not significantly stimulate intermolecular annealing and trans-splicing in vivo We have found that in an in vitro assay, the SRY protein binds to several sites of the Sry gene and especially to a (CA)25 sequence and to a (CAG)30 repeat The Q-rich domain of the mouse sex determining gene, Sry, is encoded by an in-frame insertion of a repetitive sequence composed of mostly CAG repeats. Inverted repeat structure of the Sry locus in mice. We performed separate amplifications of DXZ4 repetitive satellite sequences on the X chromosome, and SRY gene - testis determined factor on the Y chromosome, using nested PCR Detailed analysis of the Sry genomic locus reveals a further difference in that the mouse Sry open reading frame lies within 2.8 kilobases of unique sequence at the center of a large inverted repeat.  Detailed analysis of the Sry genomic locus reveals a further difference in that the mouse Sry open reading frame lies within 2.8 kilobases of unique sequence at the center of a large inverted repeat. The mouse genomic Sry locus is characterized by two arms of a large inverted repeat, flanking a unique region that, between an acceptor and a donor splice site, contains a single exon encoding the Sry protein. Recombination involving the repeat region may have led to an 11-kilobase deletion, precisely excising Sry in a line of XY female mice. Repetitive element analysis revealed numerous LINE-L1 elements at regions where conservation is lost among the Sry copies. Inverted repeat structure of the Sry locus in mice."
Is c-myc subject to regulation by the circadian clock?,yes,"The current study encompasses the investigation of simultaneous expression of four circadian clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1 and Per2) and three clock-controlled cell cycle genes (Myc, Cyclin D1 and Wee1) Our results suggest that aberrant expression of circadian clock genes can lead to aberrant expression of their downstream targets that are involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis and hence may result in manifestation of CLL. Loss of Bmal1 reduced the expression of per1, per2, per3, wee1 and p53. The expression of p21 and c-myc was also altered in certain cell lines. In particular, the proto-oncogene c-Myc has been documented to be under circadian regulation. The circadian expression of c-MYC is modulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A in synchronized murine neuroblastoma cells. Our results, using the murine neuroblastoma cell line N2A, show that Per1 and c-Myc steady-state mRNA levels oscillate with the same phase. These experiments demonstrate for the first time that a significant decrease in c-Myc transcript and protein levels can be achieved after a short TSA treatment applied only at specific circadian times. This is also followed by a reduction in the proliferation rate of the cell population. Among the circadian output pathways, the rhythmic sympathetic signaling plays a key role in the central-peripheral timing mechanism that simultaneously activates the cell cycle clock via AP1-controlled Myc induction and p53 via peripheral clock-controlled ATM activation. Jet-lag promptly desynchronizes the central clock-SNS-peripheral clock axis, abolishes the peripheral clock-dependent ATM activation, and activates myc oncogenic potential, leading to tumor development in the same organ systems in wild-type and circadian gene-mutant mice. The results showed that over-expression of Per2 induced not only cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase but also an increase in apoptosis, which was confirmed by characteristic morphological changes, FCM and evident DNA fragmentation. Further experiments confirmed both up-regulation of P53 and down-regulation of CylinB1and C-myc. On the other hand, while P53 was found to be down-regulated. CylinB1 and C-myc were up-regulated. after Per2 knockdown. We also show that BMAL1 epigenetic inactivation impairs the characteristic circadian clock expression pattern of genes such as C-MYC, catalase, and p300 in association with a loss of BMAL1 occupancy in their respective promoters. Per2 mutant (Per2(m/m)) mice show an increase in lymphomas and deregulated expression of cyclin D and c-Myc genes that are key to proliferation control. The expression of cell cycle genes such as Wee1, Cyclins, and c-Myc are under circadian control and could be directly under the regulation of the circadian transcriptional complex. Overexpressed mPER2 also altered the expression of apoptosis-related genes. The mRNA and protein levels of c-Myc, Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 were downregulated, Temporal expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, such as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, Mdm-2 and Gadd45alpha is deregulated in mPer2 mutant mice. The temporal expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, such as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, Mdm-2, and Gadd45alpha, is deregulated in mPer2 mutant mice."
Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,yes,"The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. Oncotype DXtrade mark, is a diagnostic test comprised of a 21-gene assay applied to paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue, which allows physicians to predict subgroups of hormone-receptor-positive, node-negative patients who may benefit from hormonal therapy alone or require adjuvant chemotherapy to attain the best survival outcome. Oncotype DX is a clinically validated, high-complexity, multianalyte reverse transcription-PCR genomic test that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in early-stage, node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.  We therefore investigated the analytical performance of the assay. Assays used a pooled RNA sample from fixed paraffin-embedded tissues to evaluate the analytical performance of a 21-gene panel with respect to amplification efficiency, precision, linearity, and dynamic range, as well as limits of detection and quantification. One such strategy is the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX), which is currently in commercial use in the USA. One advantage of this test is the use of paraffin-embedded blocks instead of previous methods, which required fresh frozen tissue.  We used paraffin-embedded core biopsies from a completed phase II trial to identify genes that correlate with response to primary chemotherapy.  In addition to the individual genes, the correlation of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score with pCR was examined RNA was extracted from paraffin blocks to develop the 21-gene Recurrence Score assay (Oncotype DX)"
Is K-63 linked protein ubiquitination related to proteasomal degradation?,no,"In contrast to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains function in nonproteasomal biological processes. Modification of proteins by the addition of lysine (K)-63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains is suggested to play important roles in a variety of cellular events, including DNA repair, signal transduction, and receptor endocytosis.  Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways. Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation. Chains of ubiquitin linked via lysine 48 (K48) are associated with protein degradation while chains linked via lysine 63 (K63) are associated with intracellular signaling. Lys(48)-linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and Lys(63)-linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repair Remarkably, the attached Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are homogeneous and are segregated to separate IP(3)R subunits, and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys-63-linked chains, are required for IP(3)R degradation Activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are modified by homogeneous Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, but only Lys-48-linked chains are required for degradation."
Are deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries associated with congenital disease?,yes,Deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries are associated with congenital disease.

Is vorinostat effective for glioblastoma?,no,"Conclusions: Vorinostat combined with standard chemoradiation had acceptable tolerability in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Although the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, vorinostat sensitivity and resistance signatures could facilitate patient selection in future trials. LESSONS LEARNED: Combination regimen with bevacizumab (BEV) and vorinostat is well tolerated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. CONCLUSION: Combination treatment of BEV and VOR was well tolerated. This combination therapy for this study population did not improve PFS6 or median OS when compared with BEV monotherapy. We present two patients with glioblastoma multiforme who developed severe hemolytic anemia shortly after initiating therapy with vorinostat, a pan-active histone deacetylase inhibitor, while on prophylactic dapsone. Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor that entered clinical trials in glioblastoma, showing activity in recurrent disease. Multiple phase II trials with vorinostat in combination with targeted agents, temozolomide and radiotherapy are currently recruiting.  . On the basis of the results of this phase II study, further evaluation of the vorinostat-bortezomib combination in GBM patients in this dose and schedule is not recommended. ith the increased toxicities associated with CPT-11 coupled with its unclear clinical significance, investigating the efficacy of vorinostat combined with bevacizumab alone may represent a more promising strategy to evaluate in the context of a phase II clinical trial. CONCLUSION: Vorinostat in combination with temozolomide is well tolerated in patients with HGG. A phase I/II trial of vorinostat with radiotherapy and concomitant TMZ in newly diagnosed glioblastoma is underway."
Is phospholamban phosphorylated by Protein kinase A?,yes,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation of PLB phosphorylation of PLN, at either Ser(16) by PKA  Activation of cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) by beta1-agonists involves cAMP- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), which relieves the inhibitory effects of PLB on SERCA2a.  Phospholamban (PLB) is a sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein that when phosphorylated at Ser16 by PKA phosphorylation of PLB by the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).  cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation at serine-16 Phospholamban (PLB) is a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade in the heart, functioning to modulate contractile force by altering the rate of calcium re-sequestration by the Ca-ATPase. Functionally, inhibition by PLB binding is manifested by shifts in the calcium dependence of Ca-ATPase activation toward higher calcium levels; phosphorylation of PLB by PKA reverses the inhibitory action of PLB. phosphorylation of both PLB residues (Ser16, PKA site, and Thr17, CaMKII site)  Phosphorylation of Ser(16) by PKA stabilization of the structure of PLB following phosphorylation of Ser(16) Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase, and this inhibition is relieved by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation.  Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of phosphorylated phospholamban indicated that cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates at a single site, A, and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates at sites C1 and C2 in the low molecular weight form, where A is different from C1 but may be the same as C2. Because SR function is regulated by phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), a SR protein phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at Ser(16)and Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) at Thr(17), the phosphorylation of these residues during ischemia and reperfusion was examined in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts These changes were associated with reduced protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) and protein kinase A phosphorylated phospholamban (PLB), which was reduced in HF, but essentially abolished in VD-HF The data indicate that 1) phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase is the main regulator of beta-adrenergic-induced cardiac relaxation definitely preceding Thr17 phosphorylation and 2) the beta-adrenergic-mediated phosphorylation of Thr17 by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase required influx of Ca2+ through the L-type Ca2+ channel Here we extend this model to explain the reversal of SERCA2a inhibition that occurs after phosphorylation of PLB at Ser(16) by protein kinase A (PKA) and after binding of the anti-PLB monoclonal antibody 2D12, which recognizes residues 7-13 of PLB Phospholamban is phosphorylated in heart by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CM-kinase-II) and in smooth muscle cells by cGMP-dependent protein kinase Phospholamban, the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum proteolipid, is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, by Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, and by an endogenous Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, the identity of which remains to be defined"
Can Logic Alignment Free (LAF) be used for bacterial genomes classification?,yes,"LAF: Logic Alignment Free and its application to bacterial genomes classification. In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa. This method searches for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules). We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules, each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it. In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa. LAF: Logic Alignment Free and its application to bacterial genomes classification."
Isn't c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?,no,"Amplification of MET has been reported in approximately 5%-22% of lung tumors with acquired resistance to small-molecule inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Resistance to EGFR inhibitors is likely mediated through downstream activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /AKT pathway. Simultaneous treatment of resistant tumors with a MET inhibitor plus an EGFR inhibitor can abrogate activation of downstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival, thereby overcoming acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. HGF mediated both ERK and Akt phosphorylation. ERK/Akt signaling, but not the Smad pathway, may be one of the main processes in HGF-induced EMT, The MAPK/Akt pathway is indispensable in HGF/c-Met signaling. Inhibition of c-Met activation sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of c-Met activity led to suppression of the PI3K-Akt pathway, thus enhancing cisplatin chemosensitivity. Our study clearly suggests that inhibition of c-Met activity can effectively sensitize osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling. We found that a dual Met/VEGF receptor 2 kinase inhibitor, E7050, circumvented HGF-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the Met/Gab1/PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro. Here, we report that i) treatment of RL95-2 cells with HGF resulted in phosphorylation of the HGF receptor c-Met, activation of Akt and IκB, translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, and up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA; Our data suggest that HGF possesses chemotactic ability, has anti-apoptosis action, and induces cellular infiltration via the PI3K/Akt pathway; Hepatocyte growth factor-induced c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway inhibits dendritic cell activation by blocking IκB kinase activity Activation of c-Src in turn establishes a complex consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-MET, and promotes downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin. Notably, hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated c-Src activation results in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85α/p110α and p85α/p110δ, which is required for activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, and consequent inhibition of IκB kinase and nuclear factor-κB activation. Our findings, for the first time, have identified the c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that plays a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of hepatocyte growth factor on dendritic cell activation by blocking nuclear factor-κB signaling. Cyr61 siRNA inhibited a second phase of Akt phosphorylation measured 12 hours after cell stimulation with HGF and also inhibited HGF-induced phosphorylation of the Akt target glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha. HGF+EGF treatment increased the duration of ERK1/2 and AKT activation compared to HGF or EGF alone. All these data indicate that a crosstalk between the EGF and HGF pathways in mammary epithelial cells may modulate the development of the mammary gland. Hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met promote dendritic maturation during hippocampal neuron differentiation via the Akt pathway Consistent with these results, HGF activated Akt, which phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) to inactivate it, and reduced phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which can promote microtubule polymerization and dendrite elongation when dephosphorylated. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of c-Met with its specific inhibitor, PHA-665752, or genetic knock-down of c-Met with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta, increased phosphorylation of MAP2, and reduced dendrite number and length in cultured hippocampal neurons. Inhibiting Akt activity with the phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or Akt inhibitor X suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, increased MAP2 phosphorylation, and blocked the ability of HGF to enhance dendritic length. These observations indicate that HGF and c-Met can regulate the early stages of dendrite maturation via activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta pathway. Involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in hepatocyte growth factor-induced migration of uveal melanoma cells HGF was found to enhance cell migration, and that HGF-induced migration depends on PI3K/Akt pathway. The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced by the HGF/c-Met axis is involved in the downregulation of cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and beta-catenin, contributing to the attenuation of cell-cell adhesion and promoting the enhanced motility and migration of uveal melanoma cells. HGF protects cultured cortical neurons against hypoxia/reoxygenation induced cell injury via ERK1/2 and PI-3K/Akt pathways HGF stimulated both ERK1/2 and Akt activities in cortical neurons. Inhibition of ERK activation completely abolished the protective effects of HGF, and inhibition of Akt activation reduced, but did not completely eliminate the HGF mediated neuroprotection. It is suggested that the neuroprotection of HGF depend on ERK1/2 pathway, and, to a lesser extent, PI-3K/Akt pathway.  Met signals hepatocyte survival by preventing Fas-triggered FLIP degradation in a PI3k-Akt-dependent manner Thus, Met acting on PI3K and Akt ensures high levels of FLIPL, and disruption of this pathway contributes to hepatic apoptosis and possibly to Fas-related liver diseases. The HGF-induced increase in Nkx 2.5 expression was inhibited by co-treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002, but not by its inactive homolog LY303511, suggesting an involvement of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway in this effect. X-Linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression level in colorectal cancer is regulated by hepatocyte growth factor/C-met pathway via Akt signaling Activation of XIAP expression by HGF was inhibited by siRNA targeting Akt1 and Akt2. Activation of C-MET enhances XIAP through the Akt pathway. Hepatocyte growth factor prevents ventricular remodeling and dysfunction in mice via Akt pathway and angiogenesis A significant reduction in apoptosis in the HGF-treated hearts was observed compared with control hearts, and was strongly associated with increased Akt activation. The antiapoptotic effect of HGF was mediated by activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. The protective effect of HGF/SF against the ADR-induced apoptosis was abolished in the presence of either LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3'-OH kinase (PI3-K) or 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, an inhibitor of Akt, thus implicating the activation of PI3-K-Akt signaling in the antiapoptotic action of HGF/SF. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HGF/SF stimulated the sustained phosphorylation of Akt for several hours Furthermore, ADR-induced activation of caspase-9, a downstream molecule of Akt, was inhibited for at least 24 h after HGF/SF stimulation, These results indicate that HGF/SF, but not EGF, transmitted protective signals against ADR-induced apoptosis by causing sustained activation of the PI3-K-Akt signaling pathway. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor inhibits UVB-induced apoptosis of human keratinocytes but not of keratinocyte-derived cell lines via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway When we analyzed the signaling pathways initiated by the HGF/SF receptor c-met, we found that the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream-element AKT and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were activated. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to a complete abrogation of the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF/SF, whereas blockade of the MAP kinase pathway had no effect. We now show in detached cells a cooperative effect of HGF and FN in the activation of PI 3-kinase and on the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at serine 473. PI 3-kinase activity is also required for the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival responses, as well as anchorage-independent colony growth. Together, these results demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is a key effector of the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival response of breast carcinoma cells under detached conditions and corroborate an interaction between integrin and HGF/ Met signalling pathways in the development of invasive breast cancer."
Is cytisine superior to nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation?,yes,"The effectiveness of cytisine for continuous abstinence was superior to that of nicotine-replacement therapy at 1 week, 2 months, and 6 months. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary outcome, cytisine was superior to nicotine-replacement therapy among women and noninferior among men. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with brief behavioral support, cytisine was found to be superior to nicotine-replacement therapy in helping smokers quit smoking, but it was associated with a higher frequency of self-reported adverse events."
Is valproic acid effective for glioblastoma treatment?,yes,"A Phase 2 Study of Concurrent Radiation Therapy, Temozolomide, and the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Valproic Acid for Patients With Glioblastoma. PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models.  Median overall survival (OS) was 29.6 months (range: 21-63.8 months), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5 months (range: 6.8-51.2 months). OS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 97%, 86%, and 56%, respectively. PFS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 70%, 43%, and 38% respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT/TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM was well tolerated. Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. Treatment of GDSCs with histone deacetylase inhibitors, TSA and VPA, significantly reduced proliferation rates of the cells and expression of the stem cell markers, indicating differentiation of the cells. Since differentiation into GBM makes them susceptible to the conventional cancer treatments, we posit that use of histone deacetylase inhibitors may increase efficacy of the conventional cancer treatments for eliminating GDSCs. Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients.  Our meta-analysis confirmed the benefit of using VPA (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.71). Sub-group analysis shows that patients treated with VPA had a hazard ratio of 0.74 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.59-0.94 vs. patients treated by other-AEDs and a hazard ratio of 0.66 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.52-0.84 vs. patients treated by administration of non-AEDs.  .CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to VPA administration.  A new and exciting insight is the potential contribution of VPA to prolonged survival, particularly in glioblastomas.  Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT) Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival. Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma. PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for GB was associated with overall survival (OS).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 544 adults with GB were retrospectively reviewed. Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS.RESULTS: Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA.  When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=.057; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history. Patients using VPA in combination with temozolomide showed a longer median survival of 69 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61.7-67.3) compared with 61 weeks (95% CI: 52.5-69.5) in the group without VPA (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; P = .016), adjusting for age, extent of resection, and O(6)-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase promoter methylation status. Use of VPA together with chemoradiation with temozolomide results in a 2-months' longer survival of patients with GBM."
Wasn't saracatinib being considered as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease in November 2017?,no,"A phase Ib multiple ascending dose study of the safety, tolerability, and central nervous system availability of AZD0530 (saracatinib) in Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we present a Phase Ib trial of the repurposed investigational drug AZD0530, a Src family kinase inhibitor specific for Fyn and Src kinase, for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The study was a 4-week Phase Ib multiple ascending dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AZD0530 in AD patients with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ranging from 16 to 26. A total of 24 subjects were recruited in three sequential groups, with each randomized to receive oral AZD0530 at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, or placebo daily for 4 weeks.  AZD0530 is reasonably safe and well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, achieving substantial central nervous system penetration with oral dosing at 100-125 mg.

Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,no,"We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression. The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an important role in the control of gene expression Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. Many studies have suggested a link between the spatial organization of genomes and fundamental biological processes such as genome reprogramming, gene expression, and differentiation. Moreover, we reveal that formation of such highly condensed, transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin promotes transcriptional activation of differentiation genes and loss of pluripotency. The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. we find that localized heterochromatin condensation of ribosomal RNA genes initiates establishment of highly condensed chromatin structures outside of the nucleolus We focus on the emerging relationship between genome organization and lineage-specific transcriptional regulation, which we argue are inextricably linked. Cells face the challenge of storing two meters of DNA in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus that spans only a few microns. The nuclear organization that is required to overcome this challenge must allow for the accessibility of the gene regulatory machinery to the DNA and, in the case of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), for the transcriptional and epigenetic changes that accompany differentiation In this review we summarize some of the recent findings illuminating the 3D structure of the eukaryotic genome, as well as the relationship between genome topology and function from the level of whole chromosomes to enhancer-promoter loops with a focus on features affecting genome organization in ESCs and changes in nuclear organization during differentiation We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome"
Is golimumab effective for ulcerative colitis?,yes,"Initial experience with golimumab in clinical practice for ulcerative colitis. BACKGROUND: Golimumab is a TNF-blocking agent indicated as a second-line therapy in ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this short study, golimumab seems to be an alternative treatment in naive and non-naive anti-TNF ulcerative colitis patients. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of 1-Year Treatment with Golimumab/Standard Care and Standard Care Alone for Ulcerative Colitis in Poland. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1 year of ulcerative colitis with golimumab/standard care and standard care alone in Poland. CONCLUSIONS: The biologic treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with golimumab/standard care is more effective but also more costly compared with standard care alone. Currently, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are available in the East Asian medical market, and these agents have been shown to be effective for inducing and maintaining long-term remission of IBD. Furthermore, upcoming treatments are introduced, such as golimumab, vedolizumab, AJM300, tofacitinib. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in efficacy in the maintenance phase between infliximab and golimumab or adalimumab were revealed. Infliximab proved to be more effective than adalimumab but of similar efficacy to that of golimumab in the induction phase. In this review, we will provide a detailed discussion of the three tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors currently approved for treatment of ulcerative colitis: infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab. Golimumab, a human anti-TNF antibody, is effective in patients with ulcerative colitis, according to new findings from an international phase III double-blind trial. Golimumab for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Subcutaneous golimumab maintains clinical response in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Subcutaneous golimumab induces clinical response and remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Subcutaneous golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), was evaluated as maintenance therapy in TNFα antagonist-naive adults with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis, despite conventional therapy, who responded to golimumab induction therapy.We performed a phase 3, double-blind trial of patients who completed golimumab induction trials (Program of Ulcerative Colitis Research Studies Utilizing an Investigational Treatment, eg, PURSUIT) Golimumab, a human anti-TNF antibody, is effective in patients with ulcerative colitis, according to new findings from an international phase III double-blind trial The purpose of this review was to describe the management of ulcerative colitis with emphasis on the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents.Recent research has shown that new anti-TNF agents, adalimumab (ADA) and golimumab, are effective in induction of remission and maintenance of remission in patients with extensive ulcerative colitis Vedolizumab and golimumab occurred more effective, and comparably as safe as placebo in patients with active moderate to severe ulcerative colitis increasing the number of available therapeutic options The required sample sizes for direct head-to-head trials between infliximab and adalimumab for induction and maintenance are 174 and 204 subjects respectively.This study demonstrates that, compared to placebo, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab are all effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis The biosimilar of infliximab is as effective and as safe as its originator in rheumatologic conditions, while a new anti-TNF agent, namely golimumab, has been recently approved for refractory ulcerative colitis We evaluated subcutaneous golimumab induction therapy in TNF-α antagonist-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe UC despite conventional treatment.  Vedolizumab and golimumab occurred more effective, and comparably as safe as placebo in patients with active moderate to severe ulcerative colitis increasing the number of available therapeutic options.

Recently, 2 new antibodies have been approved: golimumab is a new option for ulcerative colitis and with another more selective mechanism of action; vedolizumab could be useful for ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn's disease. The present review summarizes the literature on the role of golimumab, a new anti TNF agent, in ulcerative colitis.Literature search was done on PubMed using the search terms 'golimumab' AND 'ulcerative colitis' from inception till March 2016. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biological agents (vedolizumab, abatacept, visilizumab, golimumab) in patients with active moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.This paper was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Vedolizumab and golimumab occurred more effective, and comparably as safe as placebo in patients with active moderate to severe ulcerative colitis increasing the number of available therapeutic options. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Subcutaneous golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-á (TNFá), was evaluated as maintenance therapy in TNFá antagonist-naive adults with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis, despite conventional therapy, who responded to golimumab induction therapy.METHODS: We performed a phase 3, double-blind trial of patients who completed golimumab induction trials (Program of Ulcerative Colitis Research Studies Utilizing an Investigational Treatment, eg, PURSUIT). BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the efficacy of golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -á, for treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study demonstrates that, compared to placebo, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab are all effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. Vedolizumab and golimumab occurred more effective, and comparably as safe as placebo in patients with active moderate to severe ulcerative colitis increasing the number of available therapeutic options..

Is CHEK2 involved in cell cycle control?,yes,"Moreover, cell-cycle progression genes [i.e. E2F transcription factor (E2F) family and histone deacetylase ( HDAC )] and DNA-repair genes [i.e. growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, gamma ( GADD45G ) family and serine/threonine-protein kinase Chk2 ( CHEK2)] were also increased. As CHEK2 is a cell-cycle master controller, we tested the hypothesis that heterozygosity for the frameshift alteration CHEK2*1100delC is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma. In the current study, we evaluated the possible associations of seven common variants of the DNA repair and cell cycle control genes BRCA2 and CHEK2 with malignant melanoma (MM). Promotor methylation analysis of key regulatory genes involved in cell cycle control (p14, p15, p16, CHK2), DNA repair (hMLH1), apoptosis (p73, survivin, DAPK), and differentiation (RARb, WT1) was performed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. CHEK2 is a key cell cycle control gene encoding a pluripotent kinase that can cause arrest or apoptosis in response to unrepaired DNA damage. High-fidelity maintenance of genomic integrity in eukaryotes is ensured by cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. The checkpoint kinase, Chk2, has been implicated in both of these responses. In response to DNA damage, Chk2 is initially phosphorylated at Thr-68, which leads to its full activation. The fully activated Chk2 then phosphorylates downstream substrates of cell cycle control. Checkpoint kinase 2 (hCHK2/hCds1) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell-cycle control."
Is macitentan an ET agonist?,no,"Administration of an ET receptor antagonist, either bosentan or macitentan, markedly attenuated PD-induced MMT, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and peritoneal functional decline.  Macitentan is an oral, once-daily, dual endothelin (ET)A and ETB receptor antagonist with high affinity and sustained receptor binding that was approved in the USA, Europe, Canada, and Switzerland for the treatment of PAH. Macitentan (Opsumit®) is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with sustained receptor binding properties developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Macitentan, also called Actelion-1 or ACT-064992 [N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-(2-(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yloxy)ethoxy)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-N'-propylaminosulfonamide], is a new dual ET(A)/ET(B) endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist designed for tissue targeting. Selection of macitentan was based on inhibitory potency on both ET receptors and optimization of physicochemical properties to achieve high affinity for lipophilic milieu. In vivo, macitentan is metabolized into a major and pharmacologically active metabolite, ACT-132577.  Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range. In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors). In rats with pulmonary hypertension, macitentan prevented both the increase of pulmonary pressure and the right ventricle hypertrophy, and it markedly improved survival.  In conclusion, macitentan, by its tissue-targeting properties and dual antagonism of ET receptors, protects against end-organ damage in diabetes and improves survival in pulmonary hypertensive rats. This profile makes macitentan a new agent to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with chronic tissue ET system activation. Pharmacology of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Renal, retinal and cardiac changes in type 2 diabetes are attenuated by macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Here we investigated the effects of macitentan, an orally-active, tissue-targeting dual ET receptor antagonist on chronic complications in type 2 diabetes.MAIN METHODS: db/db mice and their age- and sex-matched controls were examined after 2 and 4 months of diabetes.  Macitentan is a novel dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist with enhanced tissue distribution and sustained receptor binding properties designed to achieve a more efficacious ET receptor blockade.  Recently oral prostacyclin receptor agonists have shown encouraging results. Many clinical studies targeting the vasoconstrictor ET-1 pathway with receptor antagonists like bosentan and ambrisentan have shown strong results, even more optimism coming from macitentan, the newest drug."
Isn't there any role for long noncoding RNAs in adipogenesis?,no,"Long noncoding RNAs regulate adipogenesis. Here we profiled the transcriptome of primary brown and white adipocytes, preadipocytes, and cultured adipocytes and identified 175 lncRNAs that are specifically regulated during adipogenesis. Many lncRNAs are adipose-enriched, strongly induced during adipogenesis, and bound at their promoters by key transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPα). RNAi-mediated loss of function screens identified functional lncRNAs with varying impact on adipogenesis. Collectively, we have identified numerous lncRNAs that are functionally required for proper adipogenesis. Here we profiled the transcriptome of primary brown and white adipocytes, preadipocytes, and cultured adipocytes and identified 175 lncRNAs that are specifically regulated during adipogenesis.

Are neurexins localized at pre-synapses?,yes,"Neurexins and neuroligins are two distinct families of single-pass transmembrane proteins localized at pre- and postsynapses, respectively.  presynaptic neurexins best-characterized transsynaptic interactions are formed by presynaptic neurexins, which bind to diverse postsynaptic ligands. presynaptic neurexin"
Isn't CREB a key memory protein?,no,"Human cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor which plays a crucial role in memory The activated CREB is implicated in the regulation of development, protection, learning, memory and plasticity in the nerve system.  A mouse genetic study showed that cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription is required for the formation of social recognition memory. Transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) plays a critical role in memory formation. It is well known that molecules like cAMP response element binding (CREB) and binding protein (CBP) play a crucial role in memory consolidation.  CREB SUMOylation by the E3 ligase PIAS1 enhances spatial memory. Therefore, CREB phosphorylation may be responsible for signal transduction during the early phase of long-term memory formation, whereas CREB SUMOylation sustains long-term memory"
Does temsirolimus improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,no,"RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus was not superior to temozolomide in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter. The actuarial 1-year survival was 72.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 58.2-82.2] in the temozolomide arm and 69.6% (95% CI, 55.8-79.9) in the temsirolimus arm [hazard ratio (HR) 1.16; 95% CI, 0.77-1.76; P = 0.47]. CONCLUSION: The combination of bevacizumab with temsirolimus was well-tolerated and resulted in stable disease of at least four months/partial response in three out of six pediatric patients with chemorefractory CNS tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus administered weekly at the dose of 75 mg/m(2) did not meet the primary objective efficacy threshold in children with high-grade glioma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma; however, meaningful prolonged stable disease merits further evaluation in combination therapy. Novel targeted agents such as bevacizumab, imatinib, erlotinib, temsirolimus, immunotherapy, cilengitide, talampanel, etc. are helping classical chemotherapeutic agents, like temozolomide, to achieve an increase in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: CCI-779 was well tolerated at this dose schedule; however, there was no evidence of efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival. CONCLUSIONS Temsirolimus was not superior to temozolomide in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter. The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival."
Is Alu hypomethylation associated with breast cancer?,yes,"Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation is associated with HER2 enriched subtype of breast cancer In IBC, Alu hypomethylation correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) status In survival analyses, low Alu methylation status tended to be associated with poor disease-free survival of the patients. Alu hypomethylation is probably a late event during breast cancer progression prominent hypomethylation of Alu and LINE-1 in HER2 enriched subtype may be related to chromosomal instability of this specific subtype. DNA methylation for three repetitive elements (LINE1, Sat2 and Alu) were analyzed in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, paired adjacent normal tissue and WBC from 40 breast cancer patients DNA methylation for the three repetitive elements was lower in tumor compared to adjacent tissue and WBC DNA."
Isn't c-myc subject to regulation by the circadian clock?,no,"The current study encompasses the investigation of simultaneous expression of four circadian clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1 and Per2) and three clock-controlled cell cycle genes (Myc, Cyclin D1 and Wee1) Our results suggest that aberrant expression of circadian clock genes can lead to aberrant expression of their downstream targets that are involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis and hence may result in manifestation of CLL. Loss of Bmal1 reduced the expression of per1, per2, per3, wee1 and p53. The expression of p21 and c-myc was also altered in certain cell lines. In particular, the proto-oncogene c-Myc has been documented to be under circadian regulation. The circadian expression of c-MYC is modulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A in synchronized murine neuroblastoma cells. Our results, using the murine neuroblastoma cell line N2A, show that Per1 and c-Myc steady-state mRNA levels oscillate with the same phase. These experiments demonstrate for the first time that a significant decrease in c-Myc transcript and protein levels can be achieved after a short TSA treatment applied only at specific circadian times. This is also followed by a reduction in the proliferation rate of the cell population. Among the circadian output pathways, the rhythmic sympathetic signaling plays a key role in the central-peripheral timing mechanism that simultaneously activates the cell cycle clock via AP1-controlled Myc induction and p53 via peripheral clock-controlled ATM activation. Jet-lag promptly desynchronizes the central clock-SNS-peripheral clock axis, abolishes the peripheral clock-dependent ATM activation, and activates myc oncogenic potential, leading to tumor development in the same organ systems in wild-type and circadian gene-mutant mice. The results showed that over-expression of Per2 induced not only cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase but also an increase in apoptosis, which was confirmed by characteristic morphological changes, FCM and evident DNA fragmentation. Further experiments confirmed both up-regulation of P53 and down-regulation of CylinB1and C-myc. On the other hand, while P53 was found to be down-regulated. CylinB1 and C-myc were up-regulated. after Per2 knockdown. We also show that BMAL1 epigenetic inactivation impairs the characteristic circadian clock expression pattern of genes such as C-MYC, catalase, and p300 in association with a loss of BMAL1 occupancy in their respective promoters. Per2 mutant (Per2(m/m)) mice show an increase in lymphomas and deregulated expression of cyclin D and c-Myc genes that are key to proliferation control. The expression of cell cycle genes such as Wee1, Cyclins, and c-Myc are under circadian control and could be directly under the regulation of the circadian transcriptional complex. Overexpressed mPER2 also altered the expression of apoptosis-related genes. The mRNA and protein levels of c-Myc, Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 were downregulated, Temporal expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, such as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, Mdm-2 and Gadd45alpha is deregulated in mPer2 mutant mice. The temporal expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, such as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, Mdm-2, and Gadd45alpha, is deregulated in mPer2 mutant mice."
Is osteocrin expressed exclusively in the bone?,no,"Evolution of Osteocrin as an activity-regulated factor in the primate brain. Here we use transcriptional profiling of human fetal brain cultures to identify an activity-dependent secreted factor, Osteocrin (OSTN), that is induced by membrane depolarization of human but not mouse neurons. Osteocrin (Ostn) is a recently discovered secreted protein produced by cells of the osteoblast lineage that shows a well conserved homology with members of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family.  Osteocrin (Ostn), a bone-active molecule, has been shown in animals to be highly expressed in cells of the osteoblast lineage.  Osteocrin, a novel bone-specific secreted protein that modulates the osteoblast phenotype."
Is autophagy modulated in a circadian fashion?,yes,"TOR signaling pathway and autophagy are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in behavior and plasticity of L2 interneurons in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster.  Our results indicate that the TOR signaling pathway and autophagy are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in the behavior and plasticity of neurons in the brain of adult flies. the pathways of autophagy, mTOR, SIRT1, and Wnt that control mammalian circadian rhythm Metabolic pathways, bile acid synthesis, and autophagic and immune/inflammatory processes are driven by the biological clock.  our findings suggest that the clock geneBmal1is a positive regulator of autophagy through the mTOR signaling pathway and protects cardiomyocytes against high-glucose toxicity. Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation system, and recently was shown to display circadian rhythms in mice."
Isn't there any algorithm for enhancer identification from chromatin state?,no,"RFECS: a random-forest based algorithm for enhancer identification from chromatin state. However, only a limited number of cell types or chromatin marks have previously been investigated for this purpose, leaving the question unanswered whether there exists an optimal set of histone modifications for enhancer prediction in different cell types. Here, we address this issue by exploring genome-wide profiles of 24 histone modifications in two distinct human cell types, embryonic stem cells and lung fibroblasts. We developed a Random-Forest based algorithm, RFECS (Random Forest based Enhancer identification from Chromatin States) to integrate histone modification profiles for identification of enhancers, and used it to identify enhancers in a number of cell-types. We show that RFECS not only leads to more accurate and precise prediction of enhancers than previous methods, but also helps identify the most informative and robust set of three chromatin marks for enhancer prediction.

is pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism effective in reducing cardiovascular events?,no,"The decision to treat elderly people is still an unresolved clinical challenge--first, due to a lack of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials of L-T4 in sHT patients, examining cardiovascular hard endpoints in various classes of age; and second, because of the negative effects of possible overtreatment. The lack of specific randomized trials enrolling either old or very old subjects, aimed at evaluate the efficacy of hormonal replacement on overall survival and cardiovascular risk reduction along with the negative effects of possible over-treatment, makes the decision to treat older people a still unresolved clinical challenge In patients with type 2 DM, the presence of SH serves as an additional risk factor for endothelial dysfunction. Treatment of SCH with levothyroxine was associated with fewer IHD events in younger individuals, but this was not evident in older people. Subclinical hyperthyroidism seems to be a risk factor of developing major cardiovascular events, especially stroke in older adults from the general population with normal left ventricular function. SCH appears to influence the postoperative outcome for patients by increasing the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unproven whether preoperative thyroxine replacement therapy for patients with SCH might prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after CABG. In CHF patients TSH levels even slightly above normal range are independently associated with a greater likelihood of heart failure progression. In current RCTs, levothyroxine replacement therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity. Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between intervention groups. However, the actual effectiveness of thyroid hormone substitution in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, the multiplicity and the possible reversibility of subclinical hypothyroidism-associated cardiovascular abnormalities suggest that the decision to treat a patient should depend on the presence of risk factors, rather than on a TSH threshold.  However, whether SH confers a high risk for cardiovascular disease, and whether LT4 therapy has a long-term benefit that clearly outweighs the risks of overzealous treatment in these individuals, remain topics of controversy."
Are there sex differences in the transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus?,yes,"To better understand the possible molecular basis for the sex-biased nature of neurological disorders, we used a developmental series of female and male mice at 1, 2, and 4 months of age to assess both mRNA and protein in the hippocampus with RNA-sequencing and mass-spectrometry, respectively. The bulk of these differentially expressed genes are changed in both sexes at one or more ages, but a total of 198 transcripts are differentially expressed between females and males at one or more ages. The number of transcripts that are differentially expressed between females and males is greater in adult animals than in younger animals. Additionally, we identify 69 transcripts that show complex and sex-specific patterns of temporal regulation through postnatal development, 8 of which are heat-shock proteins.  Additionally, this analysis reveals sex differences in the transcriptome of the developing mouse hippocampus, and further clarifies the need to include both female and male mice in longitudinal studies involving molecular changes in the hippocampus."
Aren't there web based self management strategies for chronic pain ?,no,"Fibromyalgia Symptom Reduction by Online Behavioral Self-monitoring,  This study aimed to evaluate effects of a web-based, self-monitoring and symptom management system (SMARTLog) that analyzes personal self-monitoring data and delivers data-based feedback over time. Moderate use (3 times weekly x 3 months) increased likelihood of clinically significant improvements in pain, memory, gastrointestinal problems, depression, fatigue, and concentration; heavy use (4.5 times weekly x five months) produced the above plus improvement in stiffness and sleep difficulties. Results suggest that the tailored online chronic pain management program showed promising effects on pain at 1 and 6 months posttreatment and quality of life at 6 months posttreatment in this naturalistic study. Results suggest the potential value of self-management for chronic pain patients and the potential acceptability of web-based delivery of intervention content. Patient involvement can be fostered by web-based applications combining health information with decision support or behaviour change support. These so-called Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) can reach great numbers of patients at low financial cost and provide information and support at the time, place and learning speed patients prefer. Web-based interventions may also be effective in enhancing self-management for individuals with chronic pain, but little is known about long-term effects. Research on Web-based interventions to support self-management following participation in pain management programs is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to examine the long-term effects of a 4-week smartphone-intervention"

Is dichlorphenamide effective for periodic paralysis?,yes,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). In one study dichlorphenamide (DCP) vs placebo was tested in two groups of participants: 42 with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and 31 with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP), based on clinical criteria. Thirty-four of 42 participants with hypokalemic periodic paralysis completed both treatment phases. For the 34 participants having attack rate data for both treatment phases, the mean improvement in attack rate (P = 0.02) and severity-weighted attack rate (P = 0.01) on DCP relative to placebo were statistically significant.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The largest included study that met our inclusion criteria suggested that DCP was effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralyses. For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.  Chronically, acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide, or potassium-sparing diuretics decrease attack frequency and severity but are of little value acutely.   In the HypoPP trial, there were 13 subjects who exhibited a preference (in terms of the end point) for either DCP or placebo, and 11 of these preferred DCP. In the PSPP trial, DCP significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo. DCP also significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo in the HypoPP subjects. We conclude that DCP is effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both HypoPP and PSPP. Diclofenamid has now already been administered for 2 years. It is well tolerated and has suppressed further attacks. Three patients with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HOPP)-associated progressive interattack muscle weakness, who became unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide, responded favorably to dichlorophenamide, a more potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Dichlorophenamide in single-blind placebo-controlled trials, considerably improved functional strength in two of the patients and had a moderate but definite effect in the third. Dichlorophenamide should be considered as an alternate to acetazolamide in the treatment of patients with HOPP-associated interattack muscle weakness who have become unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide. Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). Whether these drugs prevent vacuolar myopathy, which is a pathogenic factor in hypoPP, is unknown.  Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. A second trial, comparing dichlorphenamide with acetazolamide versus placebo, is currently in progress. Despite our better understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders, current treatments are largely empirical and the evidence in favor of specific therapy largely anecdotal. For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis."
Does smoking increase risk for glioblastoma?,no,"Glioma risk has consistently been inversely associated with allergy history but not with smoking history despite putative biologic plausibility. No relation was observed between glioma risk and smoking (odds ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 1.10; P = 0.37), and there were no interactions for glioma risk of smoking history with any of the risk alleles.  Non-smokers with G/A and A/A genotype showed increased glioma risk compared with G/G genotype (adjusted OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.29-2.30, p = 0.0002 and adjusted OR = 1.81, 95%CI: 1.10-2.99, p = 0.020, respectively). This association was not found in ever- or current-smokers.  There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use.  RESULTS: We found no associations between the GSTM3, GSTP1, NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, or GSTT1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk with the possible exception of a weak association between the G-C (Val-Ala) GSTP1 105/114 haplotype and glioma [odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.54, 0.99], nor was there an interaction between the effects of the GSTM3 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and cigarette smoking. We did not find any evidence for an association with life-style characteristics such as cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, use of drugs of any kind, or dietary intake of cured or smoked meat or fish. No relation was observed between glioma risk and smoking (odds ratio = 0 Glioma risk has consistently been inversely associated with allergy history but not with smoking history despite putative biologic plausibility Compared with nonsmokers, duration of cigarette smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day and pack-years of smoking were associated with increased glioma risk, although the increases in risk were relatively modest Among ever smokers, women who reported having quit smoking had a 51% increase in risk of glioma compared with never smokers (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.97-2.34), while current smokers did not appear to have an increase in risk"
Isn't there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioma patients?,no,"Mutations lead to TERT upregulation and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in glioblastomas. Kaplan-Meier's survival analysis showed that TERT promoter mutation (P=0.037), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation (P<0.001), and 1p/19q codeletion (P<0.001) were associated with favorable overall survival (OS). In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004). Consistent with this observation, in the subset of 97 IDH-mutated astrocytomas, 14 TERT promoter-mutated tumors showed longer PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). In contrast, among the subset of 74 IDH wild-type lower-grade gliomas with intact 1p/19q, TERT promoter mutation was associated with shorter PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). Similarly, in the subset of 65 IDH wild-type astrocytomas, 16 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited unfavorable PFS (P=0.007) and OS (P=0.008). Our results indicate that when combined with IDH status, TERT promoter mutation contributes to prognostic subgroups of lower-grade astrocytic tumors or 1p/19q intact lower-grade gliomas and this may further refine future molecular classification of lower-grade gliomas. RESULTS: TERTp-mut identified in 60.8% of gliomas (491 out of 807) was globally associated with poorer outcome (Hazard ratio (HR)=1.50).  TERT promoter mutations lead to high transcriptional activity under hypoxia and temozolomide treatment and predict poor prognosis in gliomas. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age. TERT promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and TMZ treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit TERT promoter mutations alone predominately have primary GBMs associated with poor median OS (11.5 months). Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit IDH1/2 mutations alone predominately have astrocytic morphologies and exhibit a median OS of 57 months while patients whose tumors exhibit both TERT promoter and IDH1/2 mutations predominately exhibit oligodendroglial morphologies and exhibit median OS of 125 months. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age.CONCLUSION: TERT promoter mutations were specific to gliomas.  We defined, based on TERTp-mut and IDH mutation status, four prognostic groups: (1) TERTp-mut and IDH-mut associated with 1p19q codeletion, overall survival (OS)>17 years; (2) TERTp-wt and IDH-mut, associated with TP53 mutation, OS=97.5 months; (3) TERTp-wt and IDH-wt, with no specific association, OS=31.6 months; (4) TERTp-mut and IDH-wt, associated with EGFR amplification, OS=15.4 months.  Mutations lead to TERT upregulation and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in glioblastomas.  In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004).  The mean age at diagnosis was lowest (37 years) among patients who had gliomas with only IDH mutations and was highest (59 years) among patients who had gliomas with only TERT mutations. The molecular groups were independently associated with overall survival among patients with grade II or III gliomas but not among patients with grade IV gliomas. Mutations were detected in gliomas, but not in meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, cavernomas, intracranial metastases, normal brain tissues, or peripheral blood of glioma patients. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age."
Hasn't field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,no,"A linear error model for the raw intensity data and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach. The algorithm has been implemented in soft- and hardware [field-programmable gate array (FPGA)] to achieve real-time performance. we have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP, Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. This paper shows how reconfigurable architectures can be used to derive an efficient fine-grained parallelization of the dynamic programming calculation. We describe how this technique leads to significant runtime savings for HMM database scanning on a standard off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array (FPGA). We have constructed a linear systolic array to perform pairwise sequence distance computations using dynamic programming. This results in an implementation with significant runtime savings on a standard FPGA. in this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm by modifying the computationally repeated portion of the algorithm by FPGA hardware custom instructions. We present a reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate array). This results in an implementation of ClustalW with significant runtime savings on a standard off-the-shelf FPGA. The accelerator implements a version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for nucleotide sequence alignment. Sequence lengths are constrained only by available memory; the product of sequence lengths in the current implementation can be up to 2(22). The machine is implemented as two NuBus boards connected to a Mac IIf/x, using a mixture of TTL and FPGA technology clocked at 10 MHz."
Isn't lambrolizumab effective for treatment of patients with melanoma ?,no,"However, through parallel efforts that have showcased the efficacy of small-molecule BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, as well as the immune checkpoint inhibitors, namely ipilimumab and the anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies (lambrolizumab, nivolumab, MPDL3280), an opportunity exists to transform the treatment of melanoma specifically and cancer generally by exploring rational combinations of molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and molecular targeted therapies with immunotherapies.  Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)/its ligand (PD-L1) antibodies have changed the landscape in oncology in 2013. The most mature results have been obtained in advanced melanoma patients.  Merck's lambrolizumab (MK-3475) monoclonal antibody received ""Breakthrough Therapy"" designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April for treating patients with advanced melanoma. The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell effector mechanisms that limits immune responses against cancer. We tested the anti-PD-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as MK-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma.  In patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.  Because of all these reasons PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are considered 'drug of the year'."

Is single-cell analysis (SCA) possible in proteomics?,no,"Toward Single Cell Analysis by Plume Collimation in Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry. he advent of proteomics and genomics at a single-cell level has set the basis for an outstanding improvement in analytical technology and data acquisition. The new-generation technology of single-cell analysis is able to better characterize a cell's population, identifying and differentiating outlier cells, in order to provide both a single-cell experiment and a corresponding bulk measurement, through the identification, quantification and characterization of all system biology aspects (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, degradomics and fluxomics). The movement of omics into single-cell analysis represents a significant and outstanding shift. Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) is a novel method for the direct imaging of biological tissues by mass spectrometry. By performing ionization in the ambient environment, this technique enables in vivo studies with potential for single-cell analysis. Other approaches for MS-based chemical imaging and profiling include those based on near-field laser ablation and inductively-coupled plasma MS analysis, which offer complementary capabilities for subcellular chemical imaging and profiling. Mass spectrometry imaging and profiling of single cells. his is rapidly changing with the recent examples of single cell genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. The rate of change is expected to accelerate owing to emerging technologies that range from micro/nanofluidics to microfabricated interfaces for mass spectrometry to third- and fourth-generation automated DNA sequencers Single-cell analysis (SCA) has been increasingly recognized as the key technology for the elucidation of cellular functions, which are not accessible from bulk measurements on the population level. Thus far, SCA has been achieved by miniaturization of established engineering concepts to match the dimensions of a single cell Single-cell proteomic chip for profiling intracellular signaling pathways in single tumor cells. The amount of single proteins in single cells can be as low as one copy per cell and is for most proteins in the attomole range or below; usually considered as insufficient for proteomic analysis. n Arabidopsis thaliana, we have successfully identified nine unique proteins in a single-cell sample and 56 proteins from a pool of 15 single-cell samples from glucosinolate-rich S-cells by nanoLC-MS/MS proteomic analysis, thus establishing the proof-of-concept for true single-cell proteomic analysis A first step towards practical single cell proteomics: a microfluidic antibody capture chip with TIRF detection."

Hasn't proteomics been used in the study of Pick's disease?,no,"In Pick's disease, increased AGE, CML, CEL, HNE and MDAL bands of about 50 kDa were observed in the frontal cortex (but not in the occipital cortex) in association with increased density of glial acidic protein bands. Thus, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and other disorders as well as brain and CSF from animals serving as models of neurological disorders have been analyzed by proteomics.  The present study is designed to investigate expression of peroxiredoxins (Prxs), the newly characterized family of highly conserved antioxidant enzymes, and other antioxidant enzymes in frontal cortex and cerebellum of DS, AD and PD patients using the technique of proteomics.

Aren't circRNAs associated with diseases and traits?,no,"Circ2Traits: a comprehensive database for circular RNA potentially associated with disease and traits. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being associated with a disease was calculated Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit aberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases In this paper we studied the potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being associated with a disease was calculated. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being associated with a disease was calculated.

Does surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?,yes,"CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no contribution from surgery. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment. Amongst the 38 women desiring pregnancy after endometrioma surgery, 19 (50%) achieved a spontaneous pregnancy during the follow-up period.  Of 33 women who wished to conceive, 67% became pregnant, spontaneously in 59% CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence and pregnancy rates are encouraging in that they seem comparable to the best reported results after endometrioma cystectomy.  While laparoscopic excision is known to improve fertility, recurrence can cause significant ovarian damage and adverse affects on fertility. Surgery is considered to play a role within the framework of the therapeutic options to cure infertile women with the disease even though its effectiveness is generally modest.  Randomized controlled trials showed that the excision technique is associated with a higher pregnancy rate and a lower rate of recurrence although it may determine severe injury to the ovarian reserve.  Surgical treatment is associated with a high recurrence rate and its employment for women undergoing assisted conception has recently been challenged. Laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometrioma prior to IVF does not offer any additional benefit over expectant management.  For those women subsequently attempting to conceive it was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04-13.29). here is insufficient evidence to favour excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to the chance of pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination (OR 1.40 CI 0.47-4.15) .  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in a context of more than one year infertility only related to endometriosis, it is reasonable to offer these patients a complete operative laparoscopic treatment of their lesions, which enables 65% of them to be pregnant within a 8.5 months post-surgical median time to pregnancy and spontaneously in 60%.   It was also associated with a subsequent increased rate of spontaneous pregnancy women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04-13.29). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation, with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile.  Surgery is an option for treatment, but there is no convincing evidence that it promotes a significant improvement in fertility. In conclusion, ovarian surgery for the treatment of endometriosis reduces the ovarian outcome in IVF/ICSI cycles in women >35 years old, and might also decrease pregnancy rates.  Improvement of pain symptoms occurred in 87% of the patients and fertility rate was 45%. The long-term results, especially the fertility outcome, have been promising: 12 of 20 women (60%) achieved a term pregnancy following a laparoscopic endometrioma procedure alone.  Among this group, 115 patients (54%) conceived following surgery; of these conceptions, 109 resulted in a living child. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Despite the available evidence that surgery for endometriomas does not improve the outcome of ART and may damage ovarian reserve, it seems that the majority of gynaecologists in the UK offer ovarian cystectomy to their patients. Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility. Removal of endometriomas before in vitro fertilization does not improve fertility outcomes: a matched, case-control study. Conclusion(s): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes. Despite the available evidence that surgery for endometriomas does not improve the outcome of ART and may damage ovarian reserve, it seems that the majority of gynaecologists in the UK offer ovarian cystectomy to their patients. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment.

Can't protein coding exons originate from ALU sequences?,no,"The Alu element has been a major source of new exons during primate evolution. Thousands of human genes contain spliced exons derived from Alu elements. More than 25% of Alu exons analyzed by RNA-Seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of Alu exons in human genes. his study presents genomic evidence that a major functional consequence of Alu exonization is the lineage-specific evolution of translational regulation. Our data suggests that lineage-specific exonization events should be determined by the combination event of the formation of splicing sites and protection against site-specific mutation pressures. These evolutionary mechanisms could be major sources for primate diversification. Exonization of Alu elements creates primate-specific genomic diversity Our data show that, once acquired, some exonizations were lost again in some lineages. In general, Alu exonization occurred at various time points over the evolutionary history of primate lineages, and protein-coding potential was acquired either relatively soon after integration or millions of years thereafter. Once integrated, they have the potential to become exapted as functional modules, e.g., as protein-coding domains via alternative splicing. This particular process is also termed exonization and increases protein versatility alternative ""Alu-exons"" also carry the potential to greatly enhance genetic diversity by increasing the transcriptome of primates chiefly via alternative splicing. ere, we report a 5' exon generated from one of the two alternative transcripts in human tumor necrosis factor receptor gene type 2 (p75TNFR) that contains an ancient Alu-SINE, which provides an alternative N-terminal protein-coding domain."
Doesn't ziconotide bind to N-type calcium channels?,no,"Since this region partially overlaps with residues previously implicated in block of the channel by omega-conotoxin GVIA, we assessed the effects of mutations in the putative EF hand domain on channel block by omega-conotoxin GVIA and the structurally related omega-conotoxin MVIIA. Both of the toxins irreversibly block the activity of wild type alpha(1B) N-type channels.  Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively.   Binding assay for both N- and P/Q-type calcium channels showed that amino acid residues restricted to the N-terminal half are important for the recognition of N-type channels, whereas essential residues for P/Q-type channel recognition are widely spread over the whole omega-conotoxin molecule. Ziconotide is a novel peptide that blocks the entry of calcium into neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, preventing the conduction of nerve signals. Ziconotide is a selective, potent and reversible blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). The therapeutic benefit of ziconotide derives from its potent and selective blockade of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Interactions of intrathecally administered ziconotide, a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, with morphine on nociception in rats. Ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, administered intrathecally for acute postoperative pain. Ziconotide, an intrathecally administered N-type calcium channel antagonist for the treatment of chronic pain. Thus, ziconotide is the first of a new class of agents--N-type calcium channel blockers, or NCCBs. Ziconotide, formerly known also as SNX- 111, represents a new class of agents, the N-type calcium channel blockers. The selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide ameliorates severe chronic pain but has a narrow therapeutic window and requires intrathecal administration. A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain. As the clinically available analgesics, pregabalin (alpha2delta-subunit calcium channel ligand), ziconotide (N-type calcium channel blocker), mexiletine (sodium channel blocker), and duloxetine (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) were evaluated in these neurochemically-induced allodynia models. The present investigation was designed to assess the safety and analgesic efficacy of ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, when administered intrathecally to patients with acute postoperative pain. Inhibition of the N-type calcium channel by intrathecal administration of the channel-specific blocker omega-conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide) is efficacious in the treatment of severe chronic pain. Ziconotide is a powerful analgesic drug that has a unique mechanism of action involving potent and selective block of N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmission at many synapses. In conclusion, present findings provide implication that the spinal anti-nociceptive mechanistic site of pregabalin is different from that of ziconotide, mexiletine, and duloxetine, and pregabalin could have a broader anti-nociceptive mechanism other than N-type calcium channel blockade. Ziconotide (SNX-111), a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, is antinociceptive when it is administered intrathecally. Effects of intrathecal administration of ziconotide, a selective neuronal N-type calcium channel blocker, on mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia in a rat model of postoperative pain. A state-dependent Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor may provide an improved therapeutic window over ziconotide, the peptidyl Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor used clinically.  There is also human validation data from ziconotide, the CaV2.2-selective peptidyl inhibitor used clinically to treat refractory pain.  A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain.  The neuroprotective effects of intrathecal administration of the selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide in a rat model of spinal ischemia."
Does TRIM37 gene mutation causes Mulibrey nanism?,yes,"OBJECTIVE: We studied pubertal development and fecundity in males with Mulibrey nanism (MUL) caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene.

Is PUVA therapy indicated for eczema treatment?,yes,"With bath PUVA treatment, the best results were found in patients with hyperkeratotic eczema (17/22; 77% good clinical response) followed by patients with palmoplantar psoriasis (26/41; 63%) and patients with dyshidrotic eczema (8/16; 50%).  Oral vs. bath PUVA using 8-methoxypsoralen for chronic palmoplantar eczema. Both oral and bath PUVA with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema.  Oral PUVA is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema and bath PUVA for patients with dyshidrotic eczema. Treatment of hand eczema is dominated by the administration of topical glucocorticosteriods. If topical treatment fails, the best second-line option is ultraviolet (UV) therapy alone or as combination therapy. UVB and PUVA (psoralen plus UVA) therapy is effective and has relatively few side effects.  Although local PUVA has been proven to be effective in the treatment of chronic hand eczema, little is known about the efficacy and safety of local narrowband UVB (TL-01) for this condition. Local narrowband UVB phototherapy regimen is as effective as paint-PUVA therapy in patients with chronic hand eczema of dry and dyshidrotic types. Smoking is likely to be a reason for the failure of bath-PUVA therapy in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema, in particular regarding smokers with eczema of the dyshidrotic type where no complete remission was achieved. Treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema with local bath-PUVA therapy. Bath-PUVA therapy has been described as successful treatment for palmoplantar eczema. Systemic PUVA therapy may be useful in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema. A new psoralen-containing gel for topical PUVA therapy: development, and treatment results in patients with palmoplantar and plaque-type psoriasis, and hyperkeratotic eczema. These results indicate that topical PUVA therapy with psoralen in aqueous gel is a useful therapeutic modality for treatment of psoriasis patients, and patients with recalcitrant dermatoses such as palmoplantar psoriasis and hyperkeratotic eczema. In order to evaluate environmental influences possibly having an impact on the efficacy of this therapy, smokers and non-smokers suffering from palmoplantar eczema treated with bath-PUVA therapy were compared. Does smoking influence the efficacy of bath-PUVA therapy in chronic palmoplantar eczema? PUVA therapy caused acute aggravation of the eczema. Hyperkeratotic eczema cleared significantly better with oral than with bath PUVA (P=0.03).CONCLUSION: Oral PUVA is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema and bath PUVA for patients with dyshidrotic eczema.

A 36-year-old female patient was treated with PUVA for dyshidrotic eczema that had not shown sufficient response to topical therapy over the previous months. BACKGROUND: Both oral and bath PUVA with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema. One patient with hand eczema consistently had detectable 8-MOP levels 1 hour after topical PUVA treatments.CONCLUSION: This report indicates that there is minimal, if any, systemic absorption of 8-MOP after topical PUVA treatment of patients with palmoplantar psoriasis. In the narrowband UVB-treated side, the tolerance of all the patients to the treatment was good all patients well-tolerated the treatment with the exception of mild xerosis that responded to topical emollients.Local narrowband UVB phototherapy regimen is as effective as paint-PUVA therapy in patients with chronic hand eczema of dry and dyshidrotic types Bath-PUVA therapy has been described as successful treatment for palmoplantar eczema Smoking is likely to be a reason for the failure of bath-PUVA therapy in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema, in particular regarding smokers with eczema of the dyshidrotic type where no complete remission was achieved Systemic PUVA therapy may be useful in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema However, few data are available on the effectiveness of local bath-PUVA therapy in palmoplantar eczema.Our purpose was to assess the effectiveness of local bath-PUVA therapy in 28 patients with chronic palmar or plantar eczema or both who were resistant to conventional topical treatment.After fungal or bacterial infection had been excluded in all patients, hands or feet or both were soaked for 15 minutes in warm water containing 1 mg/L 8-methoxypsoralen No phototoxic reactions were observed.Local bath-PUVA therapy is of value in the management of chronic palmoplantar eczema resistant to standard modes of topical treatment Treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema with local bath-PUVA therapy Bath-PUVA therapy has been described as successful treatment for palmoplantar eczema.

Smoking is likely to be a reason for the failure of bath-PUVA therapy in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema, in particular regarding smokers with eczema of the dyshidrotic type where no complete remission was achieved. However, our own observations showed that patients with palmoplantar eczema of the dyshidrotic or hyperkeratotic type responded only partially to bath-PUVA therapy. In the narrowband UVB-treated side, the tolerance of all the patients to the treatment was good all patients well-tolerated the treatment with the exception of mild xerosis that responded to topical emollients.Local narrowband UVB phototherapy regimen is as effective as paint-PUVA therapy in patients with chronic hand eczema of dry and dyshidrotic types. Comparison of localized high-dose UVA1 irradiation versus topical cream psoralen-UVA for treatment of chronic vesicular dyshidrotic eczema. No phototoxic reactions were observed.CONCLUSION: Local bath-PUVA therapy is of value in the management of chronic palmoplantar eczema resistant to standard modes of topical treatment. These results indicate that topical PUVA therapy with psoralen in aqueous gel is a useful therapeutic modality for treatment of psoriasis patients, and patients with recalcitrant dermatoses such as palmoplantar psoriasis and hyperkeratotic eczema.. Treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema with local bath-PUVA therapy. Oral PUVA is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema and bath PUVA for patients with dyshidrotic eczema.. Does smoking influence the efficacy of bath-PUVA therapy in chronic palmoplantar eczema? Local bath-PUVA therapy is of value in the management of chronic palmoplantar eczema resistant to standard modes of topical treatment. However, few data are available on the effectiveness of local bath-PUVA therapy in palmoplantar eczema. A new psoralen-containing gel for topical PUVA therapy: development, and treatment results in patients with palmoplantar and plaque-type psoriasis, and hyperkeratotic eczema. Smoking is likely to be a reason for the failure of bath-PUVA therapy in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema, in particular regarding smokers with eczema of the dyshidrotic type where no complete remission was achieved.. In order to investigate the effectiveness of topical PUVA-bath therapy (PUVA-soak therapy) on chronic palmoplantar dermatoses, 30 patients with plaque-type psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, endogenous eczema, dyshidrotic eczema and hyperkeratotic dermatitis of the palms and soles were treated over 8 weeks with PUVA-soak using 8-MOP. Our purpose was to assess the effectiveness of local bath-PUVA therapy in 28 patients with chronic palmar or plantar eczema or both who were resistant to conventional topical treatment."
Is it safe to take isotretinoin during pregnancy?,no,"Isotretinoin is a remarkably effective drug for severe, recalcitrant acne vulgaris. a number of important adverse effects were reported even the most recent pregnancy prevention program (iPledge) is no more successful than prior programs; there will likely always be a small number of female patients becoming pregnant while receiving isotretinoin for acne vulgaris. Isotretinoin has revolutionized the management of acne vulgaris. The adverse effect(s) that led to patients stopping isotretinoin were cheilitis (22 patients), mood change (13), tiredness (12), eczema (6) and pregnancy (2). Downregulation of FGFR2b-signaling by isotretinoin explains its therapeutic effect in acne. Downregulation of FGFR2b-signaling during the first trimester of pregnancy disturbs branched morphogenesis and explains retinoid embryotoxicity. The isotretinoin, a 13-cis-retinoic acid, has revolutionized the management of severe treatment-resistant acne and it has been widely used for a range of dermatological conditions, in 90% of the time in young women between 13 and 45 years of age. This agent has severe teratogenic effects, as serious craniofacial, cardiovascular, thymic and central nervous system malformations. malformations is 3-5%, but it increases to almost 30% in women exposed to isotretinoin during the first trimester of pregnancy. Generally, patients in treatment with isotretinoin avoid eventual pregnancy during assumption and, after its stopping, fertility and foetal development are normal once circulating isotretinoin levels return to normal. After 3 months of pharmacological wash out, patient become pregnant and manifested this severe malformation. Woman interrupted gestation, by labour induction. Clindamycin phosphate 1.2% together with tretinoin 0.025% as a gel (CTG) is a topical formulation of a fixed and stable combination approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age or older. Safety of CTG use in pregnancy has not been established. To estimate the population-based incidence rates of pregnancy, spontaneous and elective abortions, and birth defects associated with isotretinoin use, and to determine predictors of pregnancy while on isotretinoin Pregnancies, spontaneous and elective abortions, and birth defects were identified using procedure codes and medical diagnoses. 90 women who became pregnant while on the drug, 76 terminated the pregnancy (84%), three had a spontaneous abortion (3%), two had trauma during delivery resulting in neonatal deaths (2%) and nine had a live birth (10%). Among the live births, only one had a congenital anomaly of the face and neck (11%). elective abortion rates were also much higher in our study. Topical antibiotics, isotretinoin or systemic antibiotics are usually used for acne therapy. However, isotretinoin cannot be used during pregnancy because it can cause significant birth defects while systemic antibiotics can have adverse side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation, photosensitivity and tetracycline sensitivity. Isotretinoin has been used to treat acne since 1982. Its current indications in the package insert are limited and many physicians still feel uncomfortable prescribing it because of its side effects. Aside from its teratogenic effect, isotretinoin is a safe and excellent drug for acne therapy. I a pregnancy test in females. Vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoic acid, tretinoin and isotretinoin, are currently used in dermatological treatments. The administration of high doses of this vitamin provokes congenital malformations in mice: cleft palate, maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia and total or partial fusion of the maxillary incisors. Twelve 60-day-old female Mus musculus were divided into two groups on the 7th day of pregnancy: treated group--1 mg isotretinoin per kg body weight, dissolved in vegetable oil, was administered from the 7th to the 13th day of pregnancy; control group--vegetable oil in equivalent volume was administered orally for the same period. On the 16th day of pregnancy, the females were sacrificed, the fetuses were removed and their heads amputated. The results showed that both groups had closed palates with no reminiscence of epithelial cells; however, the first molar germs of the isotretinoin-treated animals showed delayed development compared to the control animals. Isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) is teratogenic in all species examined; based on administered dose, humans appear most sensitive, followed by (in order or decreasing sensitivity) monkey, rabbit, hamster, mouse, and rat. Based on embryonic delivered dose, we suggest that 13-cis-RA is an equipotent teratogen in hamster and rabbit. its safety in humans is occasionally questioned because oral ingestion of retinoids at therapeutic levels is known to entail teratogenic risks. topical tretinoin is not a potential human developmental toxicant. Teratogenicity of vitamin A was firstly detected in experimental animals in 1953. Nearly 30 years later, teratogenicity of vitamin A analogue-isotretinoin was reported in humans. Isotretinoin induces serious birth defects of craniofacial and central nervous system, cardiovascular system and thymic malformations--in about 25% of babies exposed during the first trimester of their prenatal development. high vitamin A intake in pregnant woman: Women who use daily vitamin A supplements during early pregnancy have approximately a two-fold increased risk of giving birth to a malformed baby. Vitamin A started to affect development between doses 0.3-0.3 microm [corrected] per embryo. Malformations of head, extremities and heart were detected similarly like in laboratory mammals and in man the minimal embryotoxic doses of vitamin A in mammals were estimated to be between 0.1-1 mg/kg of maternal weight Human epidemiological studies have proved teratogenicity of vitamin A after daily doses 25,000 i.u.-8.3 mg (0.13 mg/kg)- and reduction of its maximum intake has been recommended to 10,000 i.u. per day (0.05 mg/kg). The results about teratogenicity of vitamin A achieved in the chick embryo are in agreement with such a recommendation. Intake of vitamin A in the food is sufficient for pregnant woman in common Czech population. Therefore, an artificial supplementation of vitamin A brings risk of overdosage. If supplementation by vitamin A is unavoidable during pregnancy, B-carotene should be preferred. a teratogenic dosing regimen with 13-cis-RA [Hummler et al. (1994) Teratology 50:184-193]. plasma AUC values of all-trans-RA were 2- to 7-fold higher after all-trans-RA administration (present study) than after dosing with the teratogenic dose of 13-cis-RA. These results strengthen our recent suggestion that the teratogenic effects induced in cynomolgus monkeys by 13-cis-RA treatment cannot solely result from the action of all-trans-RA, but may involve 13-cis-RA and 13-cis-4-oxo-RA, which could act directly or function as transport vehicle. VITA, among others, is involved in the process of morphogenesis. In contrast, synthetic derivatives of VITA, specifically Tigasone (etretinate, TIG) and Roaccutane (isotretinoin, ROA), are regarded as major teratogens. A biphasic maximal inhibition was present at 1 microM concentrations when the retinoids VITA, TIG and ROA were added for 16 h (52, 58 and 57%, respectively; P < 0.01 by one-way analysis of variance). In contrast, the addition of the three retinoids at 1 microM concentrations for 16 h had no significant effect on HCG secretion by placental explants of 11-13 weeks gestational age. Inhibition of HCG secretion by retinoids may contribute either directly or indirectly to their teratogenicity. Isotretinoin is a potent retinoic acid used in the treatment of skin disorders. Though very effective, it is teratogenic if administered during pregnancy, and its teratogenic effect may be related to the normal activity of retinoids as signalling molecules in the embryo. defects that includes heart defects, by inhibiting the migration of neural crest cells. Proliferation in heart tissue of whole embryo cultures was inhibited in medium with 10(-6) M isotretinoin to 62% of the control level in myocardium. The results suggest multiple effects of retinoids on growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation of early cardiac tissue, and are discussed in relation to the potential role of retinoids in early embryogenesis. Oral administration of 400 mg/kg of 13-cis retinoic acid to 9 day pregnant mice gives rise to important maxillofacial malformations. The first manifestation of teratogenic effect is an increase of density of cell death arising in the dorsal part of the first two branchial arches at day 9.5. These two arches become hypoplastic at days 10 and 11, and the preskeletal anlagen appear too late in comparison to control embryos. Meckel's cartilage is too curvilinear and medially situated. Pre-ossicular and pre-mandibular blastemata develop with spatial distortions which are well analyzable at days 16 and 17 Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, Accutane) increases the risk of major congenital malformations in infants exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. However, there have been no epidemiologic reports to date on the effect of a subsequent pregnancy after discontinuation of isotretinoin. analysis of pregnancy case reports from patients in whom conception occurred after isotretinoin treatment had been discontinued spontaneous and missed abortions from all pregnancies was 9.1% (eight patients), and the incidence rate of congenital malformation among the live births was 5.0% (four patients). were not significantly different from the rates reported for women of reproductive age in the general population. In addition, the malformations reported were not characteristic of retinoic acid-induced congenital anomalies. Keratolenticular dysgenesis (Peters' anomaly) was induced in mice by exposure to the human teratogens, ethanol or 13-cis retinoic acid (isotretinoin, Accutane). Acute teratogen exposure on the seventh day of gestation (corresponding to the third week of human gestation) resulted in an eye malformation incidence of 46% to 100% in day 14 fetuses This secondary effect on neural crest derivatives is exhibited in the adult animals as corneal opacities associated with defects in Descemet's membrane and endothelium, and anterior polar cataracts. 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA, or isotretinoin) is responsible for various craniofacial malformations in the rodent and human embryo. In whole embryo culture, 13-cis-RA caused significant overall embryonic growth retardation, especially in the primary and secondary palatal processes. subsequent cell growth was decreased at concentrations of 13-cis-RA greater than 1 X 10(-5) M. After a 40-hr treatment period, labeling indices in retinoid-treated cells were significantly lower than control values (25% compared with 40%). Retinoic acid also caused a significant, concentration-dependent decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation. The inhibitory effect of 13-cis-RA on proliferation of oral-nasal mesenchymal cells appears to be related to the production of craniofacial malformations. Reports of adverse human pregnancy outcomes including cleft palate have increased as the clinical use of isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) and other retinoic acid (RA) derivatives have increased, but the mechanisms by which their effects are exerted are not understood. In shelves exposed to EGF and trans-RA early in their development, DNA synthesis appears to terminate prematurely as compared to shelves cultured in control media, and this effect is accompanied by excessive mesenchymal extracellular space expansion. Exposure of shelves to EGF alone is sufficient to block degeneration and induce hyperplasia of the medial epithelial cells but does not induce other ultrastructural changes seen with both EGF and RA. The observed alterations in medial cell morphology could interfere with adhesion of the palatal shelves and may play a role in retinoid-induced cleft palate in the human embryo. Recent clinical observations strongly suggest that isotretinoin [13-cis-retinoic acid (cis RA)] is a human teratogen causing primarily heart and craniofacial malformations including ear and palatal defects. Our results demonstrate that labeled cis RA enters the tissues of the embryo both in vivo and in vitro. Cis RA inhibited proliferation of the frontonasal mesenchyme cells in primary culture with 31% inhibition occurring at 2 X 10(-5) M cis RA. Retinoic acid, an analogue of vitamin A, is known to be teratogenic in laboratory animals and has recently been implicated in a few clinical case reports. To study the human teratogenicity of this agent, we investigated 154 human pregnancies with fetal exposure to isotretinoin, a retinoid prescribed for severe recalcitrant cystic acne. The outcomes were 95 elective abortions, 26 infants without major malformations, 12 spontaneous abortions, and 21 malformed infants. A subset of 36 of the 154 pregnancies was observed prospectively. Exposure to isotretinoin was associated with an unusually high relative risk for a group of selected major malformations (relative risk = 25.6; 95 per cent confidence interval, 11.4 to 57.5). It is possible that a major mechanism of isotretinoin teratogenesis is a deleterious effect on cephalic neural-crest cell activity that results in the observed craniofacial, cardiac, and thymic malformations."
Is DITPA a thyroid hormone analog utilized in experimental and clinical studies,yes,"DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg · d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The identification of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) that binds to both α- and β-type TRs with relatively low affinity was unique in that this analog improves left ventricular function in heart failure as well as lowers cholesterol. Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size. Thus DITPA administration impairs baseline cardiac parameters in mice and can be fatal during in vivo acute myocardial I/R. DITPA improved some hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, but there was no evidence for symptomatic benefit in congestive heart failure The results suggested that DITPA can promote a healthy vasculature independently from its thyroid-related metabolic effects.   Moreover, DITPA and T(4) were efficacious in preventing effects of hypothyroidism on cardiac function and BVD Both T4 and DITPA had beneficial effects on chamber remodeling, which was most likely due to beneficial changes in cell shape and improved vascular supply. The thyroid analog DITPA enhances endothelial nitric oxide and beta-adrenergic-mediated vasorelaxation by increasing nitric oxide in the vasculature."
Aren't microtubules marked by glutamylation?,no,"Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and function. Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule- interacting proteins. Enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family posttranslationally modify and thereby mark microtubules by glutamylation, generating specific recognition sites for microtubule-interacting proteins.  PTMs of the cytoskeleton, including phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, detyrosination/tyrosination, (poly)glutamylation and (poly)glycylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and palmitoylation, will be addressed in this chapter. The tubulin posttranslational modifications: acetylation, detyrosination, polyglutamylation, and polyglycylation play important roles in microtubule functions In most eukaryotic cells, tubulin is subjected to posttranslational glutamylation, a conserved modification of unclear function."
Aren't there methods for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries?,no,"A method for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries. The barcoding of next generation sequencing libraries has become an essential part of the experimental design. Barcoding not only allows the sequencing of more than one sample per lane, but also reduces technical bias. However, current barcoding strategies impose significant limitations and/or technical barriers in their implementation for ChIP-sequencing.FINDINGS: Converting Y-shaped sequencing adapters to double stranded DNA prior to agarose gel size selection reduces adapter dimer contamination and quantitating the number of cycles required for amplification of the library with qPCR prior to library amplification eliminates library over-amplification.CONCLUSIONS: We describe an efficient and cost effective method for making barcoded ChIP-seq libraries for sequencing on the Illumina platform.

Do RNA:DNA hybrids preferentially form in high or low GC regions?,yes,"Intrinsic termination signals for multisubunit bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) encode a GC-rich stem-loop structure followed by a polyuridine [poly(U)] tract, and it has been proposed that steric clash of the stem-loop with the exit pore of the RNAP imposes a shearing force on the RNA in the downstream RNA:DNA hybrid, resulting in misalignment of the active site We have observed that transcription through the GC-rich FMR1 5'UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing the non-template DNA strand. Transcription termination by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) occurs at sequences coding for a GC-rich RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract. We used single-molecule techniques to investigate the mechanism by which three representative terminators (his, t500, and tR2) destabilize the elongation complex (EC). In the 5' flanking region, nucleotides -234 to -213 encompass a GC-rich region which exhibits high homology (greater than 70%) to the 5' flanking regions of the genes of all the apolipoproteins published to date, namely, apo-A-II (-497 to -471), apo-A-I (approximately -196 to -179), apo-E (-409 to -391), and apo-C-III (approximately -116 to -103). Recently, we demonstrated that cotranscriptional RNA•DNA hybrids are preferentially formed at GC-rich trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences in vitro as well as in human genomic DNA. Considering the extent of transcription through the human genome as well as the abundance of GC-rich and/or non-canonical DNA structure forming tandem repeats, RNA•DNA hybrids may represent a common mutagenic conformation. Recently, we demonstrated that cotranscriptional RNA•DNA hybrids are preferentially formed at GC-rich trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences in vitro as well as in human genomic DNA."
Is there any relationship between histone ubiquitylation and splicing?,yes,histone H2B-specific deubiquitinase and demonstrate that H2B deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient cotranscriptional splicing of a large set of exons. H2B monoubiquitylation (H2BK123ub1) marks introns in Saccharomyces cerevisiae H2B ubiquitination by facilitating splicing pre-mRNA splicing plays a critical role in histone H2B ubiquitination unanticipated functional link between histone H2B ubiquitination and pre-mRNA splicing
Isn't STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,no,"Mechanistically, mTORC1 mediated IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, mTORC1 signaling critically protects against inflammatory bowel disease through modulation of inflammation-induced Stat3 activity. we demonstrated that STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1 expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process Furthermore, we demonstrated that STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process.  TSC1/TSC2 inactivation inhibits AKT through mTORC1-dependent up-regulation of STAT3-PTEN cascade. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1 expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).  Suppression of the mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 pathway by activated AMPK prevents hepatic insulin resistance induced by excess amino acids. Here, we review the connections between mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular processes in physiological and pathological contexts."
Is there evidence for de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates?,yes,"De novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. Evolutionary innovation relies partially on changes in gene regulation. While a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated. Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. For this, we took advantage of the massive gene loss following the last whole genome duplication in teleosts to systematically identify regions that have lost their coding capacity but retain sequence conservation with mammals. We found that these regions show enhancer activity while the orthologous coding regions have no regulatory activity. These results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish. By revealing that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences are sufficient to generate new enhancers, our study highlights an important playground for creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation. Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. While a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated.

Is the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis?,yes,"TPN22 is a tyrosine phosphatase and functions as a damper of TCR signals. A C-to-T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 1858 of human PTPN22 cDNA and converting an arginine (R620) to tryptophan (W620) confers the highest risk of rheumatoid arthritis among non-HLA genetic variations that are known to be associated with this disease 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have previously been associated with RA, including PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, CTLA4, PADI4, STAT4, FCRL3, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, KIF5A-PIP4K2C, IL2RB, TNFAIP3, IL10-1082G/A and REL he HLA locus, particularly HLA-DRB1, is its strongest genetic risk determinant across ethnicities. Several other genes, including PTPN22 and PADI4, show modest association with RA.  Several alleles in the epitope-recognition part of the HLA molecule that show the highest association with RA susceptibility, also share a common string of amminoacid residues (the so-called shared-epitope hypothesis). Other variants in potentially pathogenic genes located in non-MHC regions have been implicated by recently performed genome wide analysis studies. These genes include PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, PADI4, STAT4.  n particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided supportive evidence that RA is a disease with a strong genetic background. Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. ssociation of the PTPN22 gene (-1123G > C) polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese patients Eight markers (ie, rs1160542 (AFF3), rs1678542 (KIF5A), rs2476601 (PTPN22), rs3087243 (CTLA4), rs4810485 (CD40), rs5029937 (6q23), rs10760130 (TRAF1/C5) and rs7574865 (STAT4)) were significantly associated with RA by meta-analysis Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on RA identified known and novel susceptibility genes like HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1/C5, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, CD40, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, IL2RB, and KIF5A-PIP4K2C.  This study investigated five confirmed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility genes/loci (HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5) for association with susceptibility and severity in an inception cohort After initial completion of the Human Genome Project on the 16th February 2001, significant progress has been made in identifying other than HLA genome regions linked to the increased RA susceptibility. As an effect several new genes have been recognized as an HLA-independent genetic risk factors of RA. PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA. Recent advances have led to novel identification of genetic polymorphisms that are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA.  In conclusion, we have confirmed that PTPN22 620W allele is associated with Tunisian RA but does not constitute a factor influencing clinical manifestations.  After adjusting for smoking and reproductive factors, PTPN22 was associated with RA risk among Caucasian women in these cohorts We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P=.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples. Although HLA-DRB1 is the main RA gene, it accounts for only part of the familial risk for RA. HLA-DRB1 alleles are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the development of RA in a given individual. Several genome scans conducted in populations from France, Japan, North America and UK have confirmed the role of the HLA region and suggested several other susceptibility loci. Association studies support a role for several genes, including TNFR2, PADI4, SLC22A4, RUNX1, and PTPN22. the level of PTPN22.6 in peripheral blood correlates with disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis PTPN22, PADI-4, and CTLA-4 have been associated with risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) progression from undifferentiated arthritis to rheumatoid arthritis: the effect of the PTPN22 1858T-allele In this Dutch cohort of UA-patients, the PTPN22 1858T allele does not markedly improve individual decision-making to predict RA-development challenges in identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis are the same as those faced in most complex diseases Recently a number of convincing candidate genes have begun to emerge and an update has been provided for three of these: PTPN22"

Isn't phospholamban a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Ca ATPase SERCA?,no,"The membrane protein complex between the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLN) controls Ca(2+) transport in cardiomyocytes, thereby modulating cardiac contractility. β-Adrenergic-stimulated phosphorylation of PLN at Ser-16 enhances SERCA activity via an unknown mechanism. Phospholamban (PLN) is a type II membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), thereby regulating calcium homeostasis in cardiac muscle. In membranes, PLN forms pentamers that have been proposed to function either as a storage for active monomers or as ion channels. Regulation of the SERCA calcium pump by phospholamban (PLB) is largely due to interactions between their respective transmembrane domains. In spite of numerous mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we still do not have a clear mechanistic picture of how PLB influences the calcium transport cycle of SERCA. Calcium transport across the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart muscle contraction and relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) 2a is responsible for Ca(2+) up-take by this organelle and is inhibited in a reversible manner by phospholamban, another SR membrane protein. Thus, alleviation of phospholamban-mediated inhibition of SERCA2a is a potential therapeutic option for heart failure and cardiomyopathy. Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac contractility and functional cardiac reserve. Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and this inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylation These findings suggest that PLB is an important modulator of gastric antrum smooth muscle contractility by modulation of SR Ca(2+) release and CaM kinase II activity. The function of the SERCA pump is modulated by the endogenous molecules phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN), expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. The mechanism of action of PLB on SERCA is well characterized, whereas that of SLN is only beginning to be understood.   Phospholamban (PLB) is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). These results show that alteration of the PLB:SERCA ratio can significantly modulate smooth muscle [Ca2+]i. Phospholamban expressed in cardiac muscle and sarcolipin expressed in skeletal muscle regulate SERCA activity. Phospholamban (PLB) is a 24- to 27-kDa phosphoprotein that modulates activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). Expression of PLB is reportedly limited to cardiac, slow-twitch skeletal and smooth muscle in which PLB is an important regulator of [Ca2+]i and contractility in these muscles. Regulation of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA 2a) depends on the phosphorylation state of phospholamban (PLB). When PLB is phosphorylated, its inhibitory effect towards SERCA 2a is relieved, leading to an enhanced myocardial performance.   Ca(2+) reuptake occurs via sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and is regulated by the inhibitory protein phospholamban (PLB) in many cell types. Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban (PLN) is the endogenous inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), the integral membrane enzyme responsible for 70�% of the removal of Ca(2+) from the cytosol, inducing cardiac muscle relaxation in humans. Phospholamban (PLB) is an integral membrane protein regulating Ca(2+) transport through inhibitory interaction with sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA). Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) We used EPR spectroscopy to probe directly the interaction between phospholamban (PLB) and its regulatory target, the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA)"

Is Bladder training an effective method to treat  urge incontinence ?,yes,"Mindfulness-based stress reduction appears to be a treatment worthy of further study, as in the short term, it is as effective as historical studies of drug treatment and bladder training in reducing urge incontinence and incontinence-related quality of life. All patients, irrespective of the results of cystometry were subsequently treated with oxybutynin 2.5 mg twice daily along with bladder training. Of the 29 patients with stable bladder and symptoms of OAB, 100% cure rate was achieved in 20 (68.9%) and 06 (20.6%) patients respectively. While in 3 patients in both groups, decrease of symptoms upto 75% after 6 months of treatment was observed. Both urodynamically proven unstable and stable bladder showed nearly equal improvement with treatment There are 3 types of urine incontinence (urge-, stress-, and overflow-incontinence). Another standardization of urinary incontinence follows dysfunctions of the pelvic floor: detrusor muscle-dependent, due to sphincter spasm, prostate gland dependent. Urge incontinence with a dysfunction of the detrusor muscle is the most common type. Mixed types are frequent. Non-drug measures (e.g. pelvic muscle training, bladder training, toilet training are first choice treatments. Treatment of stress, urge and mixed incontinence can usually be commenced in primary care; pelvic floor exercises and bladder training are preferred. If bladder training is not effective for urge incontinence, anticholinergic drugs should be considered. Sixty patients (age 8 to 12 years) with urge incontinence or dysfunctional voiding were evaluated. After a no-treatment control period (average 6 months), patients underwent a 6-day bladder training course Six months after training completion, 64.1% and 64.7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with daytime wetting and 51.5% and 17.7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with nighttime wetting were cured or had improved Of the inpatient group with urge incontinence, the functional bladder capacity increased by 15%. To compare the efficacy of tolterodine plus simplified bladder training (BT) with tolterodine alone in patients with an overactive bladder. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is an effective and well tolerated treatment for an overactive bladder, the effectiveness of which can be augmented by a simplified BT regimen. Bladder training is a modification of bladder drill that is conducted more gradually on an outpatient basis and has resulted in significant reduction of incontinence in older, community-dwelling women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effect of treatment of female incontinence by the general practitioner (pelvic floor exercises, and bladder training) in female urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence and urge incontinence were treated by means of pelvic floor exercises and bladder training respectively, while a mixed incontinence was treated by bladder training followed by pelvic floor exercises. T The treatment consisted of training of pelvic muscles in stress incontinence and bladder training in urge incontinence RESULTS: After 3 months the mean frequency of urine loss per week diminished from 21 to 8, and after 12 months to 6 times. Some elders suffering from urge incontinence prefer pelvic muscle exercises to bladder training as the behavioral intervention of choice for eight out of nine women their continence had improved, both subjectively and objectively. Bladder training is a simple, safe, and effective treatment in the management of mild to moderate forms of urinary incontinence in outpatient populations. It can be used as a first-line treatment or in combination with such other interventions as pelvic muscle exercises, bladder pressure biofeedback, electrical stimulation, and drug therapy Treatment consisted of pelvic floor exercises in the case of stress incontinence and bladder training in the case of urge incontinence. After 3 months about 60% of the patients were either dry or only mildly incontinent terodiline group shows this drug to be a valuable adjunct to a bladder regimen in children with urge incontinence Basing on our experience with 39 patients with severe urge incontinence (in one-quarter of the cases pure urge incontinence, in one-half of the cases mixed incontinence and in a further quarter of the cases neurogenic bladder disorders) a supervised programme (mictiogram) and a well-tried therapy (especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries) consisting of the triad hospitalisation/bladder training/medication therapy are presented. After an average hospitalisation period of 14 days, we were able to achieve a symptom-free state in 94% of the patients. Anamnestic and urodynamical results are evaluated before and after bladder retraining drill (BRD) in women suffering from urge incontinence. We could state that the BRD is a good possibility to realize multistep-therapy of female incontinence. Twenty consecutive female patients with urge incontinence and stable detrusor function on provocative rapid fill CO2-cystometry were treated as out-patients with a bladder training programme and with terodiline/placebo in a double-blind cross-over design. In conclusion, female patients with idiopathic urge incontinence and stable detrusor function did respond to treatment as do female patients with urge incontinence and proven instability. The results of in-patient bladder training in 65 women with frequency, urgency and urge incontinence are reported. There was a good initial response in 88%. By 6 months the response rate had fallen to 38%. Patients with sensory urgency appeared to do better than those with detrusor instability and it is suggested that bladder training may be indicated as primary treatment in sensory urgency. Bladder training and/or biofeedback techniques were used to treat 75 patients with frequency, urgency, nocturia and urge incontinence. Significant improvement or cure was obtained in 70 per cent of enuretic children, and 66 per cent of men and 74 per cent of women with unstable detrusor function."

Is there any involvement of L1 retrotransposition in the Rett syndrome?,yes,"Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. Our data demonstrate that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of neuronal L1 retrotransposition. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the molecular events that can lead to neurological disorders. Furthermore, some neurological diseases, such as Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia, misregulate L1 retrotransposition, which could contribute to some pathological aspects.  Recent studies indicate that long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) are mobilized in the genome of human neural progenitor cells and enhanced in Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia.  In addition, recent data indicate that engineered human L1s can undergo somatic retrotransposition in human neural progenitor cells and that an increase in human-specific L1 DNA content can be detected in the brains of normal controls, as well as in Rett syndrome patients.

Aren't stress granules involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,no,"SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity. A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.  Two RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, aggregate in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause some forms of ALS. Recent work connecting TDP-43 and FUS to stress granules has suggested how this cellular pathway, which involves protein aggregation as part of its normal function, might be coopted during disease pathogenesis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. Fused in sarcoma (FUS) belongs to the group of RNA-binding proteins implicated as underlying factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and certain other neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple FUS gene mutations have been linked to hereditary forms, and aggregation of FUS protein is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of these diseases. In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). Profilin 1 associates with stress granules and ALS-linked mutations alter stress granule dynamics Here we report that profilin 1 and related protein profilin 2 are novel stress granule-associated proteins in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human cell lines and that ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis Furthermore, in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels. Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules. Our results suggest that the ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism. RNA-binding ability of FUS regulates neurodegeneration, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules associated with FUS carrying ALS-linked mutations. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granules In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons and glia, where it associates with stress granules (SGs) and forms large inclusions Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules Mutations in Fus cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the mutant protein forms inclusions that appear to correspond to stress granules Recent work also suggests that TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic stress granules, which are transient structures that form in response to stress.  We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested.  Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked FUS/TLS alters stress granule assembly and dynamics. Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies.  . Autophagy regulates amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked fused in sarcoma-positive stress granules in neurons However, the role of autophagy in regulation of FUS-positive stress granules (SGs) and aggregates remains unclear.  Although co-localized primarily in the nucleus in normal condition, FUS/TLS and PRMT1 were partially recruited to the cytoplasmic granules under oxidative stress, which were merged with stress granules (SGs) markers in SH-SY5Y cell. The effect of PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation on the subcellular localization, stress granules, and detergent-insoluble aggregates of FUS/TLS Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration. Here, we exploited a Drosophila model of ALS and neuronal cell lines to elucidate the role of the RNA-binding ability of FUS in regulating FUS-mediated toxicity, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules (SGs).

Aren't viruses involved in the etiology of human subacute thyroiditis?,no,"he etiology of subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis (SAT) is uncertain, although it probably represents a nonspecific inflammatory response by the thyroid to a variety of viruses. Subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory disorder of the thyroid caused probably by viruses. I We believe that the etiologic agent was the Epstein-Barr virus because heterophile and Epstein-Barr virus-specific antibodies were positive. ltogether, these results indicate that the mechanism of inhibition of Spumavirinae infection by interferon differs from that described for the other Retroviridae, and particularly for types B, C and D viruses. Our data is of therapeutic interest since Spumavirinae have been linked to pathological processes such as de Quervain thyroiditis."
Is fatigue prevalent in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma?,yes,"By contrast, fatigue worsened over time, with a difference in mean score of 5.6 points between baseline and 4-month follow-up (P=.02). In the GB cohort, the most common side effects were fatigue (56 %), diarrhea (44 %), neutropenia (31 %), and thrombocytopenia (25 %).  A total of 37 patients were treated, and treatment was well tolerated: grade 3, 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 30% of patients and consisted mainly of fatigue (14%) and neuropathy (5%); grade 3, 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 37% of patients and consisted of thrombocytopenia (30%), lymphopenia (4%), and neutropenia (4%).  Nonhematologic Grade 3 toxicity was rare, and included fatigue in 4 patients and cognitive disability in 1 patient. The most common grade 3 events were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and infection in 25, 20, 13, and 10%, respectively.  Analysis of the results of the VAS Norris scale did not demonstrate an increase in emotional fatigue but did show an increase in physical fatigue that did not reach statistical significance. With regards to the MFI 20 tool, analysis of the results demonstrated a significant increase in general (P=0.0260) as well as physical (P=0.0141) fatigue but there was no difference in the other indices. This study demonstrated a progressive increase in physical fatigue in patients with glioblastoma relapse treated with irinotecan-bevacizumab.  One patient treated with temozolomide plus isotretinoin plus thalidomide had dose-limiting grade 3 fatigue and rash, and 1 patient receiving all 4 agents had dose-limiting grade 4 neutropenia.  The toxicities observed were primarily grade 1 and 2, and the most common were fatigue, hypertension, and headache.  Fatigue (41%), rash (62%), and loose stools (58%) constituted the most frequent adverse events, the majority of these being limited to Grade 1/2.  The most common grades 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were nausea/vomiting (6.7%) and fatigue (5.8%).  Grade 3/4 toxicities included leukopenia (n = 1), lymphopenia (n = 2), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), ALT elevation (n = 3), AST elevation (n = 1), CNS hemorrhage (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), and thrombotic/embolic events (n = 3); 8 patients required dose reduction.  The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events were fatigue (7%), neutropaenia (7%), and thrombocytopaenia (7%). Bevacizumab-related toxicity included fatigue (16 patients; 4 grade 3), leukopenia (9; 1 grade 3), anemia (5; 0 grade 3), hypertension (7; 1 grade 3), deep vein thrombosis (4; 1 grade 3) and wound dehiscence (2; 1 grade 3).  Tiredness may be caused by the brain injury due to the tumor or the treatment in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Some patients describe a sense of tiredness particularly after radiation or oral chemotherapy. Levels of tiredness in patients with GBM were greatly affected by the radiotherapy and oral chemotherapy (temozolomide). The treatment had no negative effect on HRQOL, however, fatigue (P = 0.02) and constipation (P = 0.01) scales worsened over time.  This regimen was well tolerated with grade 3/4 toxicities of fatigue, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and rash requiring dose reductions.  The most common atrasentan-related toxicities were grade 1 or 2 rhinitis, fatigue, and edema. One patient developed Grade IV fatigue at the 100 ng/mL dose, but the MTD has not been established.  Side-effects in all patients have included varying degrees of anorexia, fatigue, ipsilateral forehead dermatitis, blepharitis, and conjunctivitis.   Some patients suffered from fatigue and weak concentration about three months after the end of radiotherapy, in some cases even the neurologic state was deteriorated.  grade 1-2 common toxicities included fever, chills, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and headache, neutrophilia and skin painful reactions appeared regularly at levels 3 and 4 (2.5 mg and 3.5 mg).  Ten episodes of grade 3/4 adverse events were observed in nine patients, including fatigue (n = 3), thrombocytopenia (n = 4), and myelotoxicity, febrile neutropenia, and pulmonary embolism (each n = 1). Common adverse events were CTCAE grade 1-2 fatigue, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and nausea.

Isn't tretinoin effective for photoaging?,no,"Background. Tretinoin has been shown to improve photoaged skin. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a 5% retinoic acid peel combined with microdermabrasion for facial photoaging. .Conclusion. This study demonstrated that 5% retinoic acid peel cream combined with microdermabrasion was safe and effective in the treatment of photoaging in the Iranian population.  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a double-conjugate retinoid cream demonstrated early reductions in photodamage and improvements in Hydration. AHA-Ret induced less Erythema vs retinol and was more tolerable vs retinol and tretinoin. These comparative products include prescription tretinoin, physician strength idebenone, kinetin, polyhydroxy, lactic and glycolic acids in reversing signs of photoaging. CONCLUSION: Either topical tretinoin (0.25%) or retinol (0.25%) can be used safely and effectively when applied in office immediately after SA peeling to ameliorate signs of photoaging. CONCLUSION: The treatment outcome of Retinol 0.2%/LR2412 2% cream does not differ from the one of tretinoin 0.025% cream. Clinical results were not statistically different.  INTRODUCTION: Topical tretinoin is considered the gold standard to treat photoaged skin, but it is associated with side effects and only available upon prescription. Tretinoin is commonly used topically for acne treatment and in the treatment of photoaging. BACKGROUND: Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. The efficacy of tretinoin is well established in the treatment of acne and photoaged skin, however as a typical side effect of tretinoin treatment most patients develop a low-grade irritant dermatitis. Topical tretinoin is established as an effective treatment for photoaging. BACKGROUND Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. Tretinoin is the only pharmacologic compound shown to partially reverse some signs of photoaging. Although once considered an irreversible process, it is now established that photoaging can be treated by topical tretinoin. Moreover, studies that have elucidated photoaging pathophysiology have produced significant evidence that topical tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid), the only agent approved so far for the treatment of photoaging, also works to prevent it. BACKGROUND AND DESIGN The efficacy of topical tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) in treating photoaging is well established. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS Tretinoin can be used for photoaging treatment or combined treatment by different mechanisms. Tretinoin is still the best tested retinoid to reverse photoaged skin. The separation between clinical improvement and irritation suggests that mechanisms other than irritation dominate tretinoin-induced repair of photoaging in humans. * A cream containing 0.05% tretinoin (Retinova((R)) is approved for treatment of sun-induced skin damage (""photoaging""). Randomized, controlled trials have shown that topical tretinoin is effective in the treatment of photoaged skin. Tretinoin has been shown to improve photoaged skin. Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that topical tretinoin is effective in the treatment of photoaged skin.. Tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of photodamaged skin.. Topical tretinoin improves photoaged skin. A double-blind vehicle-controlled study."
Aren't proteasome inhibitors good candidates for treatment of leukemia and solid tumors?,no,"We show that treatment with b-AP15 inhibited tumor progression in four different in vivo solid tumor models and inhibited organ infiltration in an acute myeloid leukemia model. Our results show that the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle is a new anticancer drug target We further found that ATO targets AME via both myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS1) and EVI1 moieties and degrades EVI1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and MDS1 in a proteasome-independent manner. Our results suggest that ATO could be used as a part of targeted therapy for AME-, AML1/MDS1-, MDS1/EVI1-, and EVI1-positive human cancers. Previously we had shown the synergic effect of bortezomib and thiostrepton in breast cancer cells in vitro, where sub-apoptotic concentrations of both proteasome inhibitors resulted in synergic increase in cell death when combined as a treatment. Here, we administered such a combination to MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors in vivo, and found that the effect of complementary proteasome inhibitors reduced tumor growth rates more efficiently than compared with when administered alone. Addition of a proteasome inhibitor to anti-hormonal therapy resulted in a clinical benefit rate of 22% in a limited number of patients with endocrine resistant and progressive metastatic breast cancer. Taken together, these data support the clinical development of MLN9708 for both hematologic and solid tumor indications. Bortezomib has minimal activity as a single-agent in the treatment of recurrent platinum-sensitive EOC/PPC Our study indicates a molecular mechanism by which the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells is regulated by the level of GRP78 as well as preferential induction of GRP78 or CHOP upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Our experiments therefore suggest a novel approach toward sensitization of thyroid cancer cells to proteasome inhibitors. Bortezomib (PS-341) is a novel antineoplastic agent that is well tolerated at doses not exceeding 3.0 mg (equivalent to 1.75 mg/m2), repeated on D1 and D4 every other week. This dose correlates with 70% inhibition of 20S proteasome activity. The maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of bortezomib in this schedule is 1.6 mg/m(2). Biologic activity (inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B-related markers) and antitumor activity is seen in AIPCa at tolerated doses of bortezomib. Given the results of this trial, it is safe and reasonable to recommend treatment with PS341 on the schedule used in this trial at 1.56 mg/m2/dose in Phase II trials. Particular care should be taken with patients with preexisting neuropathy The successes of proteasome inhibitors in MM are now being translated to other hematologic malignancies, including acute leukemia Such efforts have led to bortezomib, the first FDA approved proteasome inhibitor now used as a frontline treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), relapsed/refractory MM and mantle cell lymphoma We recently reported the impact and mechanisms of carfilzomib and oprozomib, second-in-class proteasome inhibitors with higher specificities and reduced toxicities, against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Carfilzomib and oprozomib potently inhibit HNSCC cell survival and the growth of HNSCC tumors"
Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,yes,"Several immunodeficiencies have been treated successfully by stem cell-targeted, retroviral-mediated gene transfer with reconstitution of the immune system following infusion of the transduced cells. In this work we have developed and tested a self-inactivating (SIN) gammaretroviral vector (SINfes.gp91s) containing a codon-optimized transgene (gp91(phox)) under the transcriptional control of a myeloid promoter for the gene therapy of the X-linked form of CGD (X-CGD).  We used a lentiviral vector encoding functional WASP to genetically correct HSPCs from three WAS patients and reinfused the cells after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen We used a lentiviral vector to transfer a functional ARSA gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from three presymptomatic patients who showed genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological evidence of late infantile MLD.  We assessed lentiviral vectors (LVs) targeted to the EC surface marker CD105 for in vivo gene delivery. gef and apoptin genes were cloned into a doxycycline-regulated retrovirus-mediated gene expression system."
Don't all archaea possess multiple origins of DNA replication?,yes,"Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Replication starts at a single Ori site in bacteria, but in eukaryotes multiple Ori sites are used for fast copying across all chromosomes. The situation becomes complex in archaea, where some groups have single and others have multiple origins of replication. Results from this in silico analysis show that the Themococcales have a single origin of replication. Until recently, the only archaeon for which a bona fide origin of replication was reported was Pyrococcus abyssi, where a single origin was identified. Although several in silico analyses have suggested that some archaeal species might contain more than one origin, this has only been demonstrated recently. In bacteria and eukaryotes, replication initiates from single and multiple origins, respectively, while archaea can adopt either of the two modes. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins.

Can't sorafenib activate AMPK?,no,"Here, we identify sorafenib as an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in a manner that involves either upstream LKB1 or CAMKK2.  Persistent activation of AMPK by sorafenib finally led to the impairment of glucose metabolism both in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells as well as in the highly glycolytic MDA-MB-231 cells, resulting in cell death. Here, we identify sorafenib as an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in a manner that involves either upstream LKB1 or CAMKK2 Sorafenib synergizes with metformin in NSCLC through AMPK pathway activation. Persistent activation of AMPK by sorafenib finally led to the impairment of glucose metabolism both in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells as well as in the highly glycolytic MDA-MB-231 cells, resulting in cell death. This previously unrecognized long-term effect of sorafenib was mediated by AMPK-dependent inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway."
Has vitamin D has been shown to reduce incidence of falls in older people in clinical trials?,yes,"However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).  The rate of falls and the number of fallers was significantly reduced in two studies evaluating the effect of medication on preventing falls; one study (85 participants) compared vitamin D versus placebo in institutionalised women after stroke with low vitamin D levels, and the other study (79 participants) evaluated alendronate versus alphacalcidol in hospitalised people after stroke. Two studies testing vitamin D versus placebo and alendronate versus alphacalcidol found a significant reduction in falls and the number of people falling .Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; seven trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Vitamin D affects bone and muscle health and likely reduces the risk of falls in the elderly. We found 26 eligible trials of moderate quality that enrolled 45,782 participants, the majority of which were elderly and female. Vitamin D use was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls (odds ratio for suffering at least one fall, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.96) This effect was more prominent in patients who were vitamin D deficient at baseline and in studies in which calcium was coadministered with vitamin D. Vitamin D combined with calcium reduces the risk of falls. The majority of the evidence is derived from trials enrolling elderly women. Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. Despite significant increases in the provision of hip protectors and use of vitamin D supplementation in both intervention and control facilities, there was no difference in the number of falls or falls injuries between the intervention and control groups, nor a reduction in falls overall. Beyond fall and fracture prevention, vitamin D may also reduce overall morbidity by multiple mechanisms.  There is evidence to suggest that these agents may reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures and falls; however, their benefit on vertebral fracture reduction may depend on the type of active vitamin D."

The imidazopyridine zolpidem is a short-acting hypnotic chemically distinct from benzodiazepines (BZs). According to its peculiar neuropharmacologic activity (selectivity for the omega 1-BZ receptors), zolpidem is expected to be a pure hypnotic, without the other effects of BZs."
Doesn't metformin interfere thyroxine absorption?,yes,LT4 absorption is unchanged by concomitant metformin ingestion. It has been hypothesized that metformin may suppress serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations by enhancing LT4 absorption or by directly affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
Is there any role for long noncoding RNAs in adipogenesis?,yes,"Long noncoding RNAs regulate adipogenesis. Here we profiled the transcriptome of primary brown and white adipocytes, preadipocytes, and cultured adipocytes and identified 175 lncRNAs that are specifically regulated during adipogenesis. Many lncRNAs are adipose-enriched, strongly induced during adipogenesis, and bound at their promoters by key transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPα). RNAi-mediated loss of function screens identified functional lncRNAs with varying impact on adipogenesis.

Can ferric carboxymaltose be used to treat anemia in inflammatory bowel disease patients?,yes,"Intravenous iron should be preferred where oral iron is poorly tolerated or where it has failed in moderate to severe anemia, and in combination with erythropoietin Ferric carboxymaltose is much more convenient, and has been shown to be more effective than iron sucrose in a large randomized tria nemia and iron deficiency anemia are very common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD Ferric carboxymaltose was associated with cost savings of 30-44 % per patient per treatment cycle compared to iron sucrose.  Iron deficiency is common in pregnancy, postpartum, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, heavy uterine bleeding, cancer and following surgery. We estimate the budget impact (BI) on the Swiss mandatory health insurance associated with substituting iron sucrose (standard) with ferric carboxymaltose (new treatment) using real-life data. reating iron deficiency involves substantial costs to the Swiss MHI which may be reduced by substituting iron sucrose with ferric carboxymaltose. e aim of this study was to observe, in a non-interventional way, how Swedish gastroenterologists adhere to guidelines in IBD outpatients treated with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), and the result of treatment FCM lowers platelet counts and platelet activation in patients with IBD-associated secondary thrombocytosis. We performed a randomized, single-blinded placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with IBD with secondary thrombocytosis (platelets > 450 G/L) e performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine if administration of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) prevents anemia in patients with IBD and low levels of serum ferritin FCM prevents recurrence of anemia in patients with IBD, compared with placebo.   A subgroup was analyzed regarding efficacy and side effects of iron supplementation with ferric carboxymaltose. Iron deficiency and anemia are frequent in IBD patients. Treatment with ferric carboxymaltose is efficious, safe and well tolerated in iron-deficient IBD patients.  Intravenous iron avoids these concerns, especially with the development of ferric carboxymaltose, which allow up to 1000mg to be given rapidly. What is the optimal treatment for anemia in inflammatory bowel disease? We compared the efficacy and safety of a novel fixed-dose ferric carboxymaltose regimen (FCM) with individually calculated iron sucrose (IS) doses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IDA Study drugs were well tolerated and drug-related adverse events were in line with drug-specific clinical experience  The simpler FCM-based dosing regimen showed better efficacy and compliance, as well as a good safety profile, compared with the Ganzoni-calculated IS dose regimen. Ferric carboxymaltose can be rapidly administered in doses of 15 mg/kg body weight, up to a ceiling dose of 1000 mg. A test dose is not required, and it can be used more widely across a spectrum of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia indication  Intravenous iron offers a rapid means of iron repletion and is superior to oral iron in many circumstances, especially in the presence of anemia of chronic disease, where it appears to overcome the block to absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract and immobilization of stored iron. The clinical situations where high doses of iron are commonly required are reviewed. These include nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, obstetrics, menorrhagia, and anemia associated with cancer and its treatment.  Ferric carboxymaltose can be administered at 15 mg/kg body weight to a maximum dose of 1000 mg, whereas iron isomaltoside 1000 can be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight. The ability to give high doses of iron is important in the context of managing iron deficiency anemia in a number of clinical conditions where demands for iron are high (including chronic blood loss associated with inflammatory bowel disease, menorrhagia, and chronic kidney disease) erric carboxymaltose (FCM, Ferinject) was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in nine, Phase III, randomized, controlled, multicenter trials in a diverse range of indications, including patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), post-partum anemia (PPA) or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), chronic heart failure (CHF), non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those undergoing hemodialysis (HD In patients with IBD or PPA, improvements in Hb levels were more rapid with FCM than with FeSulf.

FeCarb is effective and safe in IBD-associated anemia. It is noninferior to FeSulf in terms of Hb change over 12 wk, and provides a fast Hb increase and a sufficient refill of iron stores. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 28.5% of the FeCarb and 22.2% of the FeSulf groups, with discontinuation of study medication due to AEs in 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively. The median Hb improved from 8.7 to 12.3 g/dL in the FeCarb group and from 9.1 to 12.1 g/dL in the FeSulf group, demonstrating noninferiority (P= 0.6967).

Isn't Alu hypomethylation associated with breast cancer?,no,"Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation is associated with HER2 enriched subtype of breast cancer In IBC, Alu hypomethylation correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) status In survival analyses, low Alu methylation status tended to be associated with poor disease-free survival of the patients. Alu hypomethylation is probably a late event during breast cancer progression prominent hypomethylation of Alu and LINE-1 in HER2 enriched subtype may be related to chromosomal instability of this specific subtype. DNA methylation for three repetitive elements (LINE1, Sat2 and Alu) were analyzed in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, paired adjacent normal tissue and WBC from 40 breast cancer patients DNA methylation for the three repetitive elements was lower in tumor compared to adjacent tissue and WBC DNA."
Aren't long non coding RNAs spliced?,no,"Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. For alternative exons and long noncoding RNAs, splicing tends to occur later, and the latter might remain unspliced in some cases. bosome-mapping data to identify lncRNAs of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found 170 long intervening ncRNAs (lincRNAs), which had single- or multiexonic structures that did not overlap protein-coding transcripts, and about sixty antisense lncRNAs (ancRNAs), which were complementary to protein-coding transcripts We introduce an approach to predict spliced lncRNAs in vertebrate genomes combining comparative genomics and machine learning. Owing to similar alternative splicing pattern to mRNAs, the concept of lncRNA genes was put forward to help systematic understanding of lncRNAs.  Our synthesis of recent studies suggests that neither size, presence of a poly-A tail, splicing, direction of transcription, nor strand specificity are of importance to lncRNA function."
Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,no,"An East African population that gave rise to non-Africans underwent a selective sweep affecting the subcentromeric region where MTMR8 is located. This and similar sweeps in four other regions of the X chromosome, documented in the literature, effectively reduced genetic diversity of non-African chromosomes a selective sweep that has removed genetic variation from much of the drive X chromosome. evidence of reduced diversity and an excess of fixed replacement sites, consistent with a species-wide selective sweep. recent independent selective sweeps in AGO2 have reduced genetic variation episodes of natural selection (likely a selective sweep) predating the coalescent of human lineages, within the last 25 million years, account for the observed reduced diversity reduced variation or deviations from neutrality that might indicate a recent selective sweep Consider a genetic locus carrying a strongly beneficial allele which has recently fixed in a large population. As strongly beneficial alleles fix quickly, sequence diversity at partially linked neutral loci is reduced. This phenomenon is known as a selective sweep. a local selective sweep or demographic process that reduced variability reduced variation (a selective sweep) the mtDNA diversity, but not the nuclear DNA diversity, has been reduced relative to the neutral expectation of molecular evolution, suggesting the action of a selective sweep Furthermore, the amount of genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations. Our observation of reduction in variation at both intragenic and flanking loci of mutant pfcrt gene confirmed the selective sweep model of natural selection in chloroquine resistant P. A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection. In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at OsAMT1;1 in rice was caused by a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice. A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection"
"Are there studies representing the involvement of Notch mutations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Down syndrome, Pick's and Prion's disease, and cadasil syndrome?",yes,"he Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies. Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling. In a forward genetic screen for mutations that alter intracellular Notch receptor trafficking in Drosophila melanogaster, we recovered mutants that disrupt genes encoding serine palmitoyltransferase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Signaling pathways have become a major source of targets for novel therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Survival benefits achieved with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, are unprecedented and underscore the importance of improving our understanding of how signaling networks interact in transformed cells. Notch-1 immunoexpression is increased in Alzheimer's and Pick's disease (PSEN1) is the major locus for mutations causing familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and is also mutated in Pick disease of brain, familial acne inversa and dilated cardiomyopathy. It is a critical facilitator of Notch signalling and many other signalling pathways and protein cleavage events including production of the Amyloidβ (Aβ) peptide from the AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP As beta-APP and Notch are both processed by gamma-secretase, we analyzed expression of the Notch signaling pathway in the adult DS brain and in a model system for DS, human trisomy 21 fibroblasts by quantitative PCR. In adult DS cortex we found that Notch1, Dll1 and Hes1 expression is up-regulated. Moreover, DS fibroblasts and Alzheimer disease cortex also show overexpression of Notch1 and Dll1, indicating that enhanced beta-APP processing found in both DS and AD could be instrumental in these changes A systems biology approach to Down syndrome: identification of Notch/Wnt dysregulation in a model of stem cells aging Notch3 gene has been recently identified as a causative gene for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)"
Is protein Fbw7 a SCF type of E3 ubiquitin ligase?,yes,"FBW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7) is the substrate recognition component of an evolutionary conserved SCF (complex of SKP1, CUL1 and F-box protein)-type ubiquitin ligase. However, very few E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to target G-CSFR for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here we identified F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7), a substrate recognizing component of Skp-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin Ligase physically associates with G-CSFR and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. FBW7 is a crucial component of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates degradation of an array of different target proteins. F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7), the substrate-binding subunit of E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(FBW7) (a complex of SKP1, cullin-1 and FBW7), plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes. The tumor suppressor Fbxw7 (also known as Sel-10, hCdc4, hAgo, or Fbw7) is an F-box protein that functions as the substrate-recognition subunit of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and targets a group of oncoproteins for degradation.  Fbw7 is the substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)-type E3 ligase complex and a well-characterized tumor suppressor that targets numerous oncoproteins for destruction. Fbw7 is a member of F-box family proteins, which constitute one subunit of Skp1, Cul1, and F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex. The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. SCF(Fbw7) facilitates polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of various proteins such as Notch, cyclin E, c-Myc and c-Jun. Fbxw7 (also known as Fbw7, SEL-10, hCdc4, or hAgo) is the F-box protein subunit of an Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF)-type ubiquitin ligase complex that plays a central role in the degradation of Notch family members. The Fbxw7 (F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7; also called CDC4, Sel10, Ago, and Fbw7) component of the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex acts as a tumor suppressor in several tissues and targets multiple transcriptional activators and protooncogenes for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate here that Fbw7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7), the substrate recognition component of an SCF (complex of SKP1, CUL1 and F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a key regulator of NSC/NPC viability and differentiation. The SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex plays important roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated regulation of protein stability. F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7 (Fbw7) provides substrate specificity for the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex that targets multiple oncoproteins for degradation, including cyclin E, c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Mammalian Fbw7 (also known as Sel-10, hCdc4, or hAgo) is the F-box protein component of an SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein-Rbx1)-type ubiquitin ligase, and the mouse Fbw7 is expressed prominently in the endothelial cell lineage of embryos. The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase We demonstrate here that Fbw7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7), the substrate recognition component of an SCF (complex of SKP1, CUL1 and F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a key regulator of NSC/NPC viability and differentiation Here we identified F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7), a substrate recognizing component of Skp-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin Ligase physically associates with G-CSFR and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation FBW7 is a crucial component of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates degradation of an array of different target proteins"
Aren't there enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)?,no,"active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). eRNAs are distinct from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but these two species of noncoding RNAs may share a similar role in the activation of mRNA transcription  eRNAs may then facilitate enhancer-promoter interaction or activate promoter-driven transcription Enhancer RNAs: a class of long noncoding RNAs synthesized at enhancers Enhancer RNAs and regulated transcriptional programs enhancers have been found to be broadly transcribed, resulting in the production of enhancer-derived RNAs, or eRNAs The emerging roles of eRNAs in transcriptional regulatory networks we found certain enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) regulate chromatin accessibility of the transcriptional machinery at loci encoding master regulators of myogenesis (i.e., MyoD/MyoG), thus suggesting their significance and site-specific impact in cellular programming Enhancer RNAs: the new molecules of transcription  the discovery that distal regulatory elements known as enhancers are transcribed and such enhancer-derived transcripts (eRNAs) serve a critical function in transcriptional activation has added a new dimension to transcriptional regulation eRNAs reach the heart of transcription Recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which are long non-coding RNAs transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation. Since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding RNAs termed ""enhancer RNAs"" (eRNAs), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated. Recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established. In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).  A subset of enhancers are occupied by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and transcribed to produce long non-coding RNAs termed eRNAs.  Very recent evidence has indicted that some eRNAs play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by helping recruit and/or stabilize binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes.  In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation.  Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4. The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of messenger RNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis. A function of CBP at enhancers may be to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as we also observed activity-regulated RNAPII binding to thousands of enhancers. Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4.  Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established. Here we show that eRNAs facilitate the transition of paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) into productive elongation by acting as a decoy for the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex upon induction of immediate early genes (IEGs) in neurons. Recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which are long non-coding RNAs transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation.
